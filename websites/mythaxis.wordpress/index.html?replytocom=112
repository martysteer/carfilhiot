		<p><strong><em>This page is in reverse order of seeing the movie. i.e. The most recent are at the top of the page. You have to browse or SEARCH for the movie whose review you want to see. There are duplicates, from different viewings.</em></strong></p>
<p><b>Gone Girl</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Thriller focussing on the disappearance of a wife. Too long, too much sex and blood, not enough tension until nearly the end.</p>
<p><b>A Touch of Spice</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Greek language movie about a Greek family displaced from Istanbul (their family&#8217;s home for generations) to Greece due to the Cyprus crisis. Centres around a boy growing up.</p>
<p><b>Magic in the Moonlight</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Light-hearted rom-com with Colin Firth in the lead role. Witty dialogue, nice music point to Woody Allen, this time transplanted from seventies New York to the South of France in the twenties. Nothing startling, but very pleasant movie than won&#8217;t frighten the horses.</p>
<p><b>Saraband</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> (dir. Ingmar Bergman) Another slow-burn drama from Bergman, with excellent acting, fine music, a small cast, almost no scenery, no cgi, just drama. Though it’s invidious to mention any individual actor, Liv Ullman was particularly strong.</p>
<p><b>The Remains of the Day</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> On second viewing, I enjoyed this much better, admiring the acting and filming, the leisurely exposition of the theme &#8211; pleasures and disappointments, and the magnificent settings. Recommended.</p>
<p><b>Anna Karenina </b><img class="inlineimg" title="A Big Turd" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_turd.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Entirely misconceived, contrived setting of what should be a thoughtful tragedy. This started out as a grotesque farce, and didn&#8217;t improve. The BBC mini-series of 1977 remains the best, and most complete, version of this novel.</p>
<p><b>The Cruel Sea</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent tale of the Battle of the Atlantic. Very authentic.</p>
<p><b>The Shipping News</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Star-studded, yet disappointing, sometimes harrowing, movie. The filming was excellent, but I couldn&#8217;t take all the grief.</p>
<p><b>Trafic</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Another Jacques Tati movie which is wildly amusing in places, but, again, not up to the standard of <b>M. Hulot&#8217;s Holiday</b></p>
<p><b>Fracture</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Well-plotted murder and trial with a sinister Anthony Hopkins and a cocky Ryan Gosling.</p>
<p><b>Single White Female</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Disturbing movie about a creepy room mate. Many plot holes.</p>
<p><b>Aliens &#8211; Special Edition</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Lovely military hardware and monsters. Great cgi. Idiotic plot. The mayhem went on too long, but some scenes were excellent.</p>
<p><b>Monuments Men</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Star-studded, yet disappointing, movie about Nazi art thefts. Rather poor.</p>
<p><b>Fading Gigolo</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> John Turturro directs and stars as an initially reluctant gigolo, with Woody Allen as his pimp. Gentle comedy.</p>
<p><b>Deception (also The Best Offer) </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent movie set in the world of antiques and art. Geoffrey Rush, auctioneer, is fantastic in this part mystery, part romance, part crime caper. It&#8217;s the best movie I&#8217;ve seen this year (2014).</p>
<p><b>Transcendence</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br />
Very competently made, but frankly tedious movie about AI and World Domination. I was neither shaken nor stirred.</p>
<p><b>Zero Theorem </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Wonderful &#8216;dirty&#8217; future film, borrowing something of Bladerunner and Brazil, Terry Gilliam&#8217;s movie is filled with delightful detail, and features talented actors, notably the talented Christoph Waltz, but lacks a strong enough story line or a satisfying ending.</p>
<p><b>Dangerous Liaisons</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Much better than I remembered. Glenn Close and John Malkovitch suitably evil, Uma Thurman, Michelle Pfeiffer, Keanu Reeves suitably beautiful and innocent.</p>
<p><b>The Cases of Cate McCall</b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Well-wrought legal drama, very gripping and well-performed.</p>
<p><b>Das Boot </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Long, excruciating, authentic (one gathers) saga of a U-boat mission. Well-acted, tightly photographed, tense. In German with good, but incomplete, subtitles.</p>
<p><b>For a Few Dollars More </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> The classic spaghetti Western with Clint Eastwood. It all looks a little dated and stagey now, but still quite watchable.</p>
<p><b>Red Rock West </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Thriller with a Western flavour and a convoluted plot. Nicolas Cage stars. Worth seeing.</p>
<p><b>Along Came a Spider </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Thriller based on a kidnapping. A couple of plot twists make it worth watching. Morgan Freeman stars.</p>
<p><b>Mon Oncle </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Classic Jacques Tati movie in which he gently ridicules his brother-in-law&#8217;s modern house and bourgeois aspirations, enjoys the company of his nephew and screws up production in a plastics factory. In French, but no translation is required, as very little is spoken. Like M. Hulot&#8217;s Holiday, but not as funny.</p>
<p><b>The Book Thief </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Other than excellent performances from the principal actors &#8211; Sophie Melisse, Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson &#8211; and very nice photography, art direction and set decoration, I don&#8217;t have much good to say about the movie. &#8216;Death&#8217; was somehow an inappropriate addition to the drama. Everyone spoke English with a German accent, sometimes popping in a &#8216;Ja&#8217; or a &#8216;Nein&#8217;, though sometimes in crowd scenes you&#8217;d hear a bit of German. It sounded silly. There were many inconsistencies.</p>
<p><b>The Battle of the Sexes </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I first saw this Peter Sellars film, which is supposedly based on Thurber&#8217;s <em>The Catbird Seat</em>, in 1959. At the time, I was disappointed, as it elaborated wildly upon the original story, presented a pastiche of Scotland, and showed Sellars in an unexciting role. However, having seen it again the other day, I was more entertained. Sellar&#8217;s elderly Edinburgh clerk was wonderfully understated, and the scenes of Edinburgh as it was when I left school in that city were delightfully nostalgic.</p>
<p><b>All is Lost </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Very drawn-out, but extremely realistic movie of shipwreck and endurance, starring Robert Redford, indeed, featuring <strong>only</strong> Robert Redford, looking elderly but fit. A cautionary tale, not exactly entertainment, unless you are a sadist.</p>
<p><b>The Grand Budapest Hotel </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I was kind of expecting a film like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The cast of actors was dazzling, so I anticipated marvellous acting. I got neither. Instead, Wes Anderson delivers a beautiful fantasy set in staggeringly detailed sets (some of them real locations rather than sound stages). The set decoration is detailed and ornate. The framing of each scene is impeccable. The story is a headlong unlikely romp. This is a director&#8217;s movie, not an actor&#8217;s or writer&#8217;s movie. Recommended &#8211; you must see it.</p>
<p><b>Sleeping Beauty</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I think the date of this Disney animated feature -1959 &#8211; tells the tale. The animation is lazy, the accompanying Hollywood heavenly choir is loudly overactive, the story takes nearly twenty minutes to creak into action. A shadow of the quality seen in the earlier Snow White, Bambi and Pinocchio. Actually, subsequent features, like Jungle Book and Robin Hood returned to something like Walt Disney quality.</p>
<p><b>Lemony Snicket&#8217;s Series of Unfortunate Events</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Didn&#8217;t like it as much this time as last. Jim Carrey tends to be a bit of a turn-off for me, and I felt the action crawled a little. On first viewing, the plot kind of held my attention.</p>
<p><b>Mrs Brown&#8217;s Boys &#8211; d&#8217;Movie</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="A Big Turd" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_turd.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Total disaster. The tv programme of the same name has its moments of comic slapstick. This movie is a tedious waste of life. Not clever, not funny, nobody&#8217;s laughing. Avoid, even if you think you might like it.</p>
<p><b>Beaches </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Again, not my type of movie. Having said that, I found it competently filmed, entertaining, moving in parts, and enjoyed Bette Midler&#8217;s singing.</p>
<p>One surprise: CC Bloom &#8211; Bette Midler&#8217;s character &#8211; (age 11) was played by Mayim Bialik &#8211; who now plays Amy Farrah Fowler in The Big Bang Theory &#8211; a VERY different part!</p>
<p><b>No Country for Old Men</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent film-making, but a disappointing ending and dialogue impossible to comprehend without subtitles, unless you have a degree in Mumbled Texan dialect.</p>
<p>Having since read the book, I find that the movie clings close to the plot and much of the dialogue of the book, but ends before the book does. Understandable for dramatic purposes, as the book enters a cerebral phase in which the sheriff contemplates the world, his life and work. However, that rumination rounds off the book in a satisfactory fashion that&#8217;s missing from the movie.</p>
<p><b>Philomena </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Not my type of movie, really, but I was glued to the screen throughout.</p>
<p><b>American Hustle</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Christian Bale is excellent in this, as are the two women and the two male supporting actors. A drawn-out caper with an implausible plot, but worth sitting through for the twist in the tail.</p>
<p><b>Andrei Rublev</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Thee Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Tarkovsky&#8217;s medieval epic, I&#8217;m afraid, did not speak to me. The separate episodes, the images, the photography, were all excellent, but if there was a coherent story line, I missed it. And it was very long. I was not entranced by his <b>Stalker</b>, but it was much better than this. I think Tarkovsky&#8217;s individual scenes are masterly, but the thread of story-telling is lost.</p>
<p><b>Volver</b> <img class="inlineimg" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" /> Delightful Almodovar movie which gallops gaily around the subjects of death, incest, child abuse, murder and deception, maintaining a light-hearted atmosphere while delivering great drama and a satisfactory conclusion. Penelope Cruz stars, but the whole cast is excellent, as is the music and photography. In Spanish, with excellent English subtitles.</p>
<p><b>Sleepless in Seattle</b> <img class="inlineimg" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Agreeable romcom with more com than rom. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.</p>
<p><b>The Oxford Murders</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Thee Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Self-absorbed movie that wraps a philosophical debate inside a murder mystery, and fails to deliver either. Interesting, but not satisfying.</p>
<p><b>Conspiracy Theory</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Thee Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Rather obvious movie. Mel Gibson overacts. The conspiracy ceases to be a theory very soon, and it turns into a chase movie.</p>
<p><b>CASH (also CA$H)</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent French movie with Jean Dujardin, Jean Reno, Valeria Golino and many more. Very convoluted Confidence Trick-based plot. Delightful throughout. French and English with English subtitles.</p>
<p>(I append here the other &#8216;CA$H&#8217; I reviewed)<br />
<b>CA$H</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Sean Bean (Hollywood) version. A simple bank robbery tale, well filmed, and reasonably entertaining. I won&#8217;t go further than that.</p>
<p><b>The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> A remake of a much better movie. The cast was OK, but the script was strangely lacking and predictable. The Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw version from 1974 was far superior.</p>
<p><b>Django </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I can&#8217;t usually fault Tarantino, his direction is once again top-class but his reputation for violence is well-earned, and this was just a bit over the top.</p>
<p><b>Captain Philips </b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Really gripping (almost) true account of a shipjacking incident off Somalia.</p>
<p><b>Reasonable Doubt </b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Very clever premise, and quite tense in the initial stages, then it becomes sort of meh.</p>
<p><b>Steel Magnolias </b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Sort of high-class chick-flick, really. Good acting, particularly from a young Julia Roberts and from Olivia Dukakis. But all a bit weepy, really, and, like a classic tragedy, the weepy bit results from the weakness of the doomed character.</p>
<p><b>Gravity </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Rather lengthy, great effects, can&#8217;t say I was gripped by it, and the bit where the other pilot climbed in and helped in a sort of &#8216;Use the Force, Luke&#8217; moment&#8230; Nope.</p>
<p><b>The Great Gatsby </b> (Baz Luhrmann, Leo di Caprio version) <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Very true rendering of the book, greatly superior to the old Robert Redford version. A little over the top, as you&#8217;d expect from Baz. I was impressed yet again by Leo&#8217;s acting. My first experience of Leo was Titanic, and, frankly, it soured me, but everything I&#8217;ve seen him in since (other than the Aviator) I&#8217;ve been pleased with.</p>
<p><b> Never Let Me Go</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Slow borderline science fiction, beautifully acted and filmed.</p>
<p><b>Julia&#8217;s Eyes</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Very well-done edge-of-seat thriller. In Spanish with English subtitles. Recommended.</p>
<p><b>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azhkaban</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> One of the better Potters. I was more entertained this time than last.</p>
<p><b>Batman Begins</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> In my opinion, the best of the Batmans so far. Motivationally speaking, it goes a little crazy towards the end, but the spectacle is consistently good.</p>
<p><b>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I enjoyed this. Skullduggery on the financial markets, but, frankly, I have a good grasp of the stockmarket having worked in dealing rooms, but much of it either went over my head, or wasn&#8217;t real.</p>
<p><b>Ice Age: Continental Drift</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Watched about ten minutes of this, mostly the entertaining intro. Then we got to the bit where the mammoths were behaving and talking like an American Mum, Dad and the kids &#8211; see any US family sitcom. Sorry. Won&#8217;t watch.</p>
<p><b>The Unbearable Lightness of Being </b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Sex-heavy, sense-light drama about love and the Czek revolution. Very watchable, lots of good scenes including newsreel of the disorder, but the romantic plot a little stilted in my opinion.</p>
<p><b>Lights in the Dusk</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Finnish crime movie. Actually very good, and atmospheric.</p>
<p><b>Zodiac (2007)</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Immersive movie/dramadoc about the hunt for the Zodiac killer. Gyllenhall and Downey star.</p>
<p><b>American Psycho</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Ugly serial killer movie, redeemed to an extent by casting Christian Bale as the psycho.</p>
<p><b>Hidden (Caché)</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Michael Haneke&#8217;s mysterious movie about surveillance and guilt. Beautifully made, great photography. Totally spoiled by having no ending. Haneke himself declines to interpret the plot. One is tempted to think they ran out of ideas.</p>
<p><b>Hush</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Evil mother-in-law movie.</p>
<p><b>LOTR 3</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Fine enactment of Volume 3 of Tolkien. Would that The Hobbit were as good.</p>
<p><b>The Silence of the Lambs</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> My umpteenth viewing of this, and it&#8217;s still chilling. Recommended.</p>
<p><b>Conspiracy</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> A movie about the Lincoln assassination, and the execution of some relatively imnnocent conspirators. I can&#8217;t find it in IMDB under that title, so I probably got it wrong.</p>
<p><b>To Kill a Mocking Bird</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> It&#8217;s taken me a long time to see this movie. I never knew what the fuss was about, and the book, a school reader in the USA, was new to me, too. I enjoyed it, particularly the court scene. Gregory Peck was a little wooden, I thought, but the children were a treat. A moral tale, of course, with Atticus&#8217; defence of a black worker, and the revelation that the handicapped boy next door was quite the opposite of the monster everyone believed.</p>
<p><b>The Thin Red Line</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Mallick&#8217;s war film set in Guadalcanal, WWII. Much more action, and suitably tense throughout. Really likeable and hateable characters. The movie was unnecessarily long, and too harrowing to be entertainment, but an excellent movie, nonetheless, with great photography and acting.</p>
<p><b>Jarhead</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Everything you didn&#8217;t want to know about Army life in the US Marines. Sure, we know that all sorts of beastliness go on; yes, war is long periods of boredom and misery, interspersed with occasional moments of terror; oh dear, your girlfriend might find someone else if you&#8217;re away for six months. As an unsavoury documentary, it succeeds. As entertainment, it doesn&#8217;t even try.</p>
<p><b>Horatio Hornblower RN</b> (1951) <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Gregory Peck as the famous sea captain, an excellent production. The cast includes Virginia Mayo, Robert Beatty, Stanley Baker, James Robertson Justice as a simple seaman, Christopher Lee as a Spanish naval officer. A little corny but I liked it.</p>
<p><b>Days of Heaven</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Beautifully filmed and much more satisfactory in its way than The Tree of Life, yet it was very slow in one way, in that we were treated to sunsets and landscapes and sillhouettes between the dramatic bits; in contrast, the story line often seemed rushed. A treat for its cinematography, and worth seeing just for that.</p>
<p><b>The Tree of Life</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I found it hard to rate this &#8220;masterpiece&#8221; from Terence Mallick. On the one hand, many of the images were excellent, many of the contemplations well thought-out and some of the irony cleverly portrayed. Yet my main complaints were that it was&#8230; boring, that many of the vignettes were not played out, that the &#8220;creation of life&#8221; sequence cleverly avoided any hint of the Evolution word, that the end sequence of everyone walking around the mudflats was inexplicable and that the representation of parenthood was at one and the same time overly disciplinarian and overly affectionate. Frankly, it was self-indulgent stuff. I look forward to seeing an actual drama directed by this chap. It could be quite something. But Tree of Life wasn&#8217;t. 3 stars overrates it in the entertainment department, but the cinematography was good.</p>
<p><b>A Touch of Evil</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I love Orson Welles. I think he was a genius. I admired his The Trial, and always enjoy his acting, and his rich brown voice. But this movie, though often quoted as a masterwork, was desperately dated and uninspiring.</p>
<p><b> The Bed Sitting Room</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> A fore-runner of much of British &#8216;silly&#8217; comedy, It&#8217;s set in post-nuked London, a man is turning into a bedsit. It&#8217;s a bit like a feature-length Monty Python sketch, but not as good.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bed-Sitting_Room_%28film%29" target="_blank"> It&#8217;s too complicated. This is the Wikipedia entry.</a> It was always too long, but now it&#8217;s also tedious.</p>
<p><b>The Crying Game</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> IRA murder plots, kidnap, violence, sex and seriously poor singing, yet well performed and filmed.</p>
<p><b>Mr Brooks</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> A superficially average thriller redeemed by an engaging plot decoration in the form of Kevin Costner&#8217;s alter ego, played by William Hurt. Recommended if you like thrillers.</p>
<p><b>Sleuth 2007</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> This remake 0f the 1972 original (itself a movie-isation of a stage play) is not successful. Michael Caine plays the part Olivier played in the 1972 version, while Jude Law plays the part Caine played in the 1972 version. It is immensely stylish, with lighting effects and some very uncomfortable interior decoration. The acting is great, but there&#8217;s an insincerity about the screenplay, and an uncomfortably abrupt denouement. The same talents could have made a better movie than this.</p>
<p><b>Untouchable</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Very enjoyable French movie about a rich man, paralysed in an accident, and his helper, an immigrant from the housing schemes. It is said to be &#8216;based&#8217; on a real story, but I cannot imagine the real thing would have been so entertaining.</p>
<p><b>The Bourne Legacy</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Begins well, otherwise it&#8217;d only have had 2 stars, then descends into a fine representative of the CGI smash, bang, wallop, shoot-em-up, inconceivably unlikely garbage that comes out of Hollywood these days. No sign of Jason Bourne, except for a WANTED poster. Contains a completely unecessary sub-plot about body-enhancing virus-vectored treatments. Finishes with an unconvincingly improbable car chase, followed by a totally obvious hook for another episode of the same. G R O A N.</p>
<p><b>22 Bullets (originally L&#8217;Immortel &#8211; why change it?)</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> French gangster movie starring Luc Besson. OK. It&#8217;s a gangster movie, but beautifully filmed, acted, and plotted. It looked real. What a contrast to the &#8220;CGI smash, bang, wallop, shoot-em-up, inconceivably unlikely garbage that comes out of Hollywood these days&#8221; (see The Bourne Legacy). Recommended. It&#8217;s occasionally on Sky Movies.</p>
<p><b>The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I was VERY impressed with this movie. It appeared to be made using similar technology to <i>Hugo</i>, but what a difference! There is only one scene, near the end, where I think the animation went over the top to the point where it defied the laws of the universe, but otherwise it was immaculate. Good script, good characters, imaginative plot, wonderful set-dressing, and it didn&#8217;t lose the feel of the Herge original. Recommended.</p>
<p><b>Snow White and the Huntsman</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> We were keen to see this, as some of the locations were near us. The fishing village and some of the forest footage were just half a mile from our house. The locations and costumes were excellent. The CGI was impressive, especially the phantom army and the wicked stepmother transformation. Unfortunately, the story was (I think the modern term is&#8230;) pants, the screenplay awful, and the acting, mostly as a result of the above, was meh, at best. The dwarves were a bevy of the usual character-acting suspects. Oh dear.</p>
<p><b>Princess Mononoke</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Certainly not as good as Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle, the only Ghibli I have been able to sit right through. Having just watched two Disney offerings, the animation in this movie is clunky, characterisation very bland, and only interesting for the story. In contrast to the rather mechanical animation, the backgrounds are superb, so that&#8217;s a plus point.</p>
<p><b>Disney&#8217;s Winnie the Pooh</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> And in total contrast to Bambi, Disney&#8217;s version of the A A Milne classic is a deep disappointment. The one star I have given it is for the animators, who did a jolly good job of animating E H Shepherd&#8217;s illustrations, but the corny trans-Atlantic voices and the efforts to spice the stories up are a complete turn-off. I suspect it should never have been attempted. And where did the ground squirrel figure in the English countryside?</p>
<p><b>Prometheus</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Waste of talent. Waste of CGI. Rotten story. Awful script. I won&#8217;t be waiting with bated breath for the inevitable sequel.</p>
<p><b>Bambi</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Genius.</p>
<p><b>Blood Simple</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Complex, satisfying tale of crime and retribution, filmed by the Coens in a 40s noir style. It takes a while to pick up pace, but it&#8217;s worth the wait, and the actors and direction are excellent.</p>
<p><b>Batman Begins</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Surprisingly good, though the unlikely motivation of Liam Neeson&#8217;s character became a little irksome. However, it was good to look at, suitably dark, and not at all juvenile, unlike its predecessors.</p>
<p>We also saw another well-thought-of movie &#8211; <b>Gambit</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="A Big Turd" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_turd.gif" alt="" border="0" /> which was SO bad, we ditched it about 20 minutes in, despite the fact we&#8217;d paid LoveFilm good money to see it, on the basis that the cast was promising (Colin Firth, Cameron Diaz, Alan Rickman, Stanley Tucci, Tom Courtenay). Avoid.</p>
<p><b>Bright Young Things</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> An adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#8217;s novel &#8220;Vile Bodies,&#8221; &#8216; A look into the lives of a young novelist, his would-be lover, and a host of young people who beautified London in the 1930s&#8217;. I really wanted to like it, but, hey, I didn&#8217;t. It was detestable, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Before the Devil Knows You&#8217;re Dead</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Truly excellent, though violent, Sidney Lumet thriller with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney, Marisa Tomei. Simply, a heist goes very wrong, and the subsequent tension is maintained throughout. While I usually abhor flashbacks, the flashbacks in this movie have a real and revelatory purpose. Truly recommended.</p>
<p><b>Body of Lies</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Leo di Caprio (white hat) and Russell Crowe (black hat) in a big budget CIA vs CIA vs Al Caida caper in the Middle East. It was OK up until the love interest, then it fell apart under the weight of its unlikely plot.</p>
<p><b>Shadow Dancer</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Low budget, grim little tale of a mole in the IRA. Clive Owen stars. Gripping throughout.</p>
<p><b>Margin Call</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Absolutely the best movie I&#8217;ve seen this year. No guns, no car chases, no sex, yet the tension is palpable throughout this believable drama set in a financial dealing organisation. Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto, Jeremy Irons, Kevin Spacey and Stanley Tucci are in it. Recommended.</p>
<p><b>John Carter</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Some nice cgi, but really just kids&#8217; stuff</p>
<p><b>21 Grams</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Star-studded cast, hopelessly confused, especially in the first ten minutes. Flashback-mad direction. Hated it.</p>
<p><b>Battleship</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> US Navy versus the Aliens. Load of tosh, really, but I adored it. The Sub-woofer on our AVamp got a great workout, the CGI was impressive, the plot predictable, most of the tech totally outside the laws of physics, but, hey, you can&#8217;t have major fleet actions without making a bit of a compromise.</p>
<p><b>All About Eve</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Old b/w movie. Well-wrought story of arrogance versus ambition. I hate it, though, when they show you the end right at the start of the movie. It kind of takes the tension out of it.</p>
<p><b>Bram Stoker&#8217;s Dracula</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Actually a lot better than I expected, though the end was a bit over the top.</p>
<p><b>Life is Beautiful</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Nicely made, but it gave me the creeps.</p>
<p><b>Men who Stare at Goats</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Fairly star-studded, but disappointing, movie (except for the goats, whose performance was most realistic). Too little substance and virtually no logic to the tale.</p>
<p><b>Wait Until Dark</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Thriller from the late 60s with Audrey Hepburn as a recently blind girl beset by drug dealers. Unlike many movies of that vintage, it still has tension and excellent acting.</p>
<p><b>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> (The original one with Maggie Smith) Really excellent, but a little dated these days.</p>
<p><b>The Pirates! In An Adventure with Scientists</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Very good indeed in parts, but it kind of palled towards the middle and ended over the top, but not in a nice way. Great Aardman animation throughout.</p>
<p><b>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Expected to hate this, but it turned out to be rather good. Deeper and more affecting than the trailer and publicity would have you anticipate.</p>
<p><b>Festen</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Well-regarded Danish movie. But family movies are not really our thing.</p>
<p><b>Beautiful Boy</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Slow start. Promising cast. Exciting developments leading to&#8230; to nothing, really&#8230;</p>
<p><b>J Edgar</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I cannot, in all honesty, give it a rating, because I gave up after about 20 minutes of flashback / flashforward incomprehensible brutality and strangled accents.</p>
<p><b>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; hated it. Tear-jerker with child star. Not my bag. I watched it all and wished I hadn&#8217;t bothered.</p>
<p><b>Zatoichi</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> [dir Takeshi Kitano who also stars] Not really a perfect 5-star, but such a headlong romp and pastiche of martial arts interspersed with comedy, and rounded off with a finale that puts Slumdog to shame, unexpected and fresh. The plot? A blind swordsman helps 2 geishas to get revenge. Many die.</p>
<p><b>Life of Pi</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Not as fantastic as I&#8217;d hoped. The tiger was grrreat, but the movie was too slow at the beginning and end, and sometimes boring . Maybe it&#8217;d be against the purpose of the novel, but why didn&#8217;t they show both stories in movie form?</p>
<p><b>The Parallax View (1974)</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> It may have been impressive in 1974, but it is awful now, except for a few very good images. The plot peters out disappointingly.</p>
<p><b>The Hobbit</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Points added on for the spectacle, art direction and set decoration. Points deducted for blatant profiteering by taking a relatively small book and making three feature films out of it. Shame on you. (Detailed review follows)</p>
<p><b>Mother</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> We didn&#8217;t watch much of this acclaimed Korean movie. Too worrying at the beginning. It wasn&#8217;t a pleasure.</p>
<p><b>Blood Simple</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Another Coen <i>noir</i> offering. Excellent in its way, but not quite as entertaining as <i>The Man Who Wasn&#8217;t There</i>. Excellent cinematography, and some memorable lines.</p>
<p><b>Shakespeare in Love</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> We sat with gritted teeth through a rerun of this movie. It&#8217;s clever in places, but there is too much love and nudity and not enough Shakespeare, while the plot is lame.</p>
<p><b>Angela-A </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> (dir Luc Besson) [IMDB&#8217;s summary &#8220;A beautiful woman helps an inept scam artist get his game together&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really hack it.] Black and white, beautifully photographed, light-hearted drama set in Paris (French dialogue, English subtitles.). The plot is a bit magic realism.</p>
<p><b>Don&#8217;t Look Now</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> (dir Nicholas Roeg) Weird rendering of a Daphne du Maurier story. I have removed a star for Donald Sutherland&#8217;s haircut &#8211; or perm &#8211; and for his unconvincing running around and silly mistakes, but the movie is beautiful, set in a very atmospheric Venice and quite chilling.</p>
<p><b>Gorky Park</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent interpretation of Martin Cruz Smith&#8217;s novel. William Hurt plays Renko, Lee Marvin plays the villain. Really enjoyable.</p>
<p><b>The Illusionist</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Strange animated movie, featuring Jacques Tati. Appealing, sad, beautifully drawn and animated. Most of it is set in a very recognisable Edinburgh.</p>
<p><b>Skyfall</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> The best Bond movie since Sean Connery hung up his Walther PPK. We had to see it anyway, because the closing scenes were filmed in Hankley Common, where we walk and play golf several times a week. We saw the sets and the helicopter attack being filmed. It&#8217;s a Surrey moor (masquerading as a Scottish moor in the movie)</p>
<p><b> The Man Who Wasn&#8217;t There <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b>Coen brothers thriller. A rivetting black and white 40s style thriller, beautifully photographed, tightly scripted, excellently acted. Recommended.</p>
<p><b>The Red Desert </b>(dir Antonioni) <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> A visual delight, lacking only a coherent story. Monica Vitti goes slightly mad in an Italian industrial landscape. Richard Harris moons around to little effect. There&#8217;s a fog at one point. But the VISUAL effect is stunning, Antonioni had whole streets and groves of trees spray-painted to make the atmosphere correct.</p>
<p><b>Wall Street &#8211; The Money Never Sleeps </b>(dir Oliver Stone) <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Update on the Gordon Gecko story, set during the crash of 2008. Lavish and stylish, well acted and plotted, though the details of derivatives and leveraging were somewhat glossed over, leaving the viewer a little dazed at times, but the atmosphere was good and realistic.</p>
<p><b>Charlotte Gray</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent adaptation of the Faulkes novel. Cate Blanchett stars. A gripping narrative, beautifully filmed. You may find holes in the plot, but they are forgiveable.</p>
<p><b>Hunger Games</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> OK quasi-sf movie, but I wouldn&#8217;t rave about it.</p>
<p><b>Heat</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Cops and robbers with Al Pacino and Robert di Nero. Very good of its type.</p>
<p><b>Leon</b> (dir Besson) <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Fabulous. Gary Oldman, Jean Reno, Natalie Portman. Hit men and crooked cops. Violence with a soft centre.</p>
<p><b>The Third Man </b>(dir Reed) <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Looking very dated and stagey now, and not a good example of Welles&#8217; acting. And the zither is absolutely inexorable.</p>
<p><b>The Seventh Seal</b> (dir Bergman) <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent movie, enjoyed it yet again. It doesn&#8217;t seem to date. It&#8217;s a little slow in parts, but really dramatically strong, well acted, well directed, great primitive locations.</p>
<p><b>Hugo</b> (dir Scorsese) <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Both of these stars are for the technique of the movie &#8211; its look, particularly the clockwork, and the colour and sets and set decoration. The story itself is weak, and the pace of the movie is so slow that it&#8217;s seriously BORING. And the child is a bit twee. See <b>The Artist</b>. See <b>Amelie</b> (not Amelia). See, even, Scorsese&#8217;s own <b>The Godfather</b>. This comic book adaptation doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p><b>Stalker</b> (dir Tarkovsky) <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> There is a plot synopsis <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/synopsis" target="_blank">here</a> . If you plan to watch this movie, I suggest you read it first. It&#8217;s important to know, before you start, that nothing much happens in the movie, but that it&#8217;s worth seeing because of the atmosphere and images. I won&#8217;t be watching it again, but I&#8217;m glad I saw it. I think it&#8217;s overrated, but that&#8217;s just me. All the other movie buffs think it&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Witness for the Prosecution</b> (1957) <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Agatha Christie play done up for the movies. Great performance from Charles Laughton. Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich also star. I can&#8217;t like Marlene Dietrich, and Tyrone Power is not a convincing Englishman, but they didn&#8217;t spoil it and the movie was redeemed by an excellent plot and very good filming.</p>
<p><b>The Artist</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> <a href="http://palimpsest.org.uk/forum/showpost.php?p=128870&amp;postcount=8" target="_blank">Review here</a></p>
<p><b>Elite Syncopations </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Prompted by the Scott Joplin music in The Sting, we watched this ballet again. Even if you don&#8217;t like dance, you will find this cheeky, seductive, comical production from the Royal Ballet a treat. I promise.</p>
<p><b>The Sting</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Paul Newman and Robert Redford in a cleverly plotted confidence trick movie. Some fine surprises. Excellent music by Scott Joplin. Never seen it? You missed yourself.</p>
<p><b>Amadeus</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Saw this again on Blu-Ray. A brilliant movie with great music. Was impressed all over again.</p>
<p><b>The Secret in their Eyes </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent Argentinian movie. We saw it last year for the first time, and couldn&#8217;t resist another viewing.</p>
<p><b>Zorba the Greek</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I was very impressed with this movie the first time I saw it &#8211; in the sixties. This time, I was still impressed with the filming and the acting, but I&#8217;d forgotten some of the horror it contains. Anthony Quinn makes a good Cretan, considering he&#8217;s a Mexican-Irish actor, you have to say he&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>The Company Men</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I didn&#8217;t expect much of this movie, except that it had Tommy Lee Jones, Ben Affleck and Kevin Costner in it, but, in the event, it was quite good. Basically, it&#8217;s about redundancy, but it is treated so well that we were gripped by it. Story very good, and realistic. Acting excellent.</p>
<p><b>Topkapi</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Rather dated heist movie, much lightened by the presence of Peter Ustinov and Robert Morley, with Melina Mercuri overacting as usual. Directed by Jules Dassin, too, so it&#8217;s not all bad once it gets going.</p>
<p><b>The Lincoln Lawyer</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I can&#8217;t do better than the IMDB summary &#8220;A sleazy defense attorney has a crisis of conscience when he represents a wealthy client who has a foolproof plan to beat the system.&#8221; A Byzantine plot and unexpectedly well done.</p>
<p><b>The Informant!</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Fairly gripping, true, but hard-to-believe story of a price-fixing scam and embezzlement. Matt Damon stars with some success.</p>
<p><b>The General <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /></b> Buster Keaton&#8217;s famous locomotive chase movie. I pay tribute to the stunts without stuntmen, the effects without artificial assistance, the use of such hard-to-use vehicles as railway trains, the pioneering ambition of it all. But it&#8217;s a thin story with a pie-faced love interest.</p>
<p><b>Evita</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Finally saw this all the way through. I was very impressed by the music, the spectacle and the crowd scenes. Jimmy Nail, who&#8217;d have thought it? Banderas, surprisingly good considering the difficulty of some of his tunes. Madonna &#8211; a little weak compared with Elaine Page, but tuneful and very like Evita herself in appearance.</p>
<p><b>Primal Fear</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Passable courtroom thriller about an altar boy accused of murder. The high point is some excellent acting from a young Edward Norton.</p>
<p><b>In the Nick of Time</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Yaaawwwnnn. Johnnie Depp and Christopher Walken were never so boring. This unlikely tale makes no sense and evinces no tension.</p>
<p><b>Amelia <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /></b> Tripe. Painful to watch. Unbelievable. Riddled with anachronisms. Waste of talented actors.</p>
<p><b>Solaris (the Hollywood version)</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I haven&#8217;t seen the Tarkovsky movie, but this Clooney vehicle was so&#8230; unprepossessingly obvious, let&#8217;s say, .. that I felt insulted by it. To the point where I only watched about 20 minutes. The two stars are for the set decoration and FX, which were very good.</p>
<p><b>Conviction</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Nice &#8216;true&#8217; movie about a sister campaigning to free her imprisoned brother. The movie spans about 16 years &#8211; it takes nearly as long to watch it, but it&#8217;s watchable.</p>
<p><b>Snake Eyes <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b>Excellent movie about a lovable bent cop and a military conspiracy at a boxing match. Impressively, the first 13 minutes appears to be one long take. The cinematography is better than the drama.</p>
<p><b>Crimson Rivers</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Stylish French Cop drama. It tries too hard. I&#8217;d not bother.</p>
<p><b>Staten Island <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /></b> Don&#8217;t waste your time on this promising, but ultimately hopeless movie. I only wasted 20 minutes.</p>
<p><b>The Time Traveller&#8217;s Wife <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b>Total chickflick masquerading as a science fiction drama. Lost patience very early and abandoned it.</p>
<p><b>In a Better World</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Not our kind of movie. A Danish movie about two troubled boys and their families. Meh. Tragedy is forecast at an early stage.</p>
<p><b>Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off</b> still <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Our fifth? sixth? viewing of this mildly iconoclastic hilarious teen comedy. So Much Fun. Do not miss this, and make sure you watch to the end of the credits and beyond.</p>
<p><b>You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> A Woody Allen movie set in London! A messy farce of a movie, well-scripted, well-acted, amusing. I&#8217;d become bored by Allen&#8217;s Manhattan settings and neurotic New Yorkers. Somehow this was refreshing.</p>
<p><b>The Town</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Gangster thriller which I didn&#8217;t expect to like, but it was quite well done, with shoot-em-ups and car chases you could care about. Starred and directed by Ben Affleck. The direction was pretty good.</p>
<p><b>The Debt</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Tense thriller starring Helen Mirren and Tom Wilkinson as Mossad agents with a secret to keep. It would&#8217;ve been 5 star for me, but for repeated flashes back/forward/in-between, all unnecessary, in my opinion. They could have told the story in sequence with equal impact.</p>
<p><b>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent Cold War thriller, excellently acted. I confess I preferred the tv series in many ways, because it was more leisurely, but enjoyed this immensely too.</p>
<p><b>The Adjustment Bureau </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Another Philip K Dick story delivered to the screen. Well made. Not entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p><b>True Grit</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Didn&#8217;t expect to like it, but it was great.</p>
<p><b>Scenes from a Marriage <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b>Bergman. Recommended. Review <a href="http://palimpsest.org.uk/forum/showpost.php?p=128516&amp;postcount=29" target="_blank">here</a> .</p>
<p><b>The Talented Mr Ripley</b> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/palimpsest.org.uk/forum/../images/smilies/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Minghella&#8217;s adaptation of the Highsmith book adds a few plot elements not in the novel, but it&#8217;s a great movie. See it.</p>
<p><b>Cowboys and Aliens </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Total tosh, but nicely filmed and, on the whole, as entertaining as any shoot-em-up movie. But don&#8217;t go unless you like cowboy and/or alien movies. Bad start to the year&#8217;s movie-watching.</p>
<p><b>Sister Act</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> A Whoopi Goldberg vehicle, redeemed only by a number of the bit players, Hollywood should be ashamed of itself.</p>
<p><b>Talk to Her (Hable con Ella)</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" />. Wonderful Almadovar movie with great soundtrack. The plot a trifle weird, but the photography, acting and atmosphere are spot on. See it.</p>
<p><b>Harold and Maud</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Weird but beautiful movie about a young man with a death obsession and his friend, an old lady. It&#8217;s billed as a black comedy, and it&#8217;s comical at times but it&#8217;s also very impressive and well made. Don&#8217;t miss it if it drifts by your tv.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:magenta;">Moonstruck</span> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" />. </b>Again. It&#8217;s an obsession. But watch it if you get the chance. The following from my previous mini-review: &#8220;OK, it&#8217;s a slushfest in places, but it&#8217;s funny, too, and this is one of my favourite movies. Cher, Nicholas Cage, Olympia Dukakis, Tony Aiello&#8230; Dean Martin with <i>That&#8217;s Amore. </i>&#8221;</p>
<p><b>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets&#8217; Nest</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" />. I don&#8217;t know what I expected, but, like the book, this third, and last, in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series is the worst of the three. There&#8217;s no point in watching it unless you&#8217;ve seen the other two. Nevertheless, a well made thriller, though The Girl is weirder than ever in this episode.</p>
<p><span style="color:magenta;"><b>Made in Dagenham</b></span> <img title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" />. Excellent Brit-pic about a strike at Ford in 1966. Not, I must say, subject matter close to my heart, but beautifully made, and my era. I was working in gritty Glasgow at the time. Excellent acting from all concerned.</p>
<p><b>Le Quattro Volte </b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" />. Beautiful to look at, this Cannes-winning movie is very still. It&#8217;s easy to commend for cinematography, hard to commend for plot. Impossible to commend for characterisation, except for the goats and the dog, who are great actors. But for immersive, dreamy, sometimes tense, often sad, contemplation of a year in the life of a village, it can&#8217;t be beaten. You are a fly on the wall, and it works.</p>
<p><b>Complicity</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" />. Despite liking Iain Banks, I disliked this film. Adding to the irritation were a mumbled soundtrack and no subtitles.</p>
<p><b>The Social Network</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" />. Interesting, but rather unsatisfactory. story of a lawsuit.</p>
<p><b>The Last Victim</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" />. Ugly little movie about a student&#8217;s relationship with an imprisoned killer.</p>
<p><b>Four Weddings and a Funeral</b>. <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Entertaining slush, contains feelgood factor.</p>
<p><b>Love Actually</b>. <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Entertaining slush, contains feelgood factor.</p>
<p><b>Tron Legacy</b> <img class="inlineimg" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_turd.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Dear, oh dear.</p>
<p><b style="color:magenta;">Playtime</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Jacques Tati&#8217;s final movie. A shame, really, as it doesn&#8217;t come close to M. Hulot&#8217;s Holiday, or Mon Oncle, despite being expensively set and filled with characters. Tati&#8217;s subtle humour is drawn out very thin here, and the laughs are wry, rather than uproarious.</p>
<p><b> The American </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> The fourth star is for the scenery and cinematography in this otherwise predictable, yet entertaining, George Clooney vehicle.</p>
<p><b>Route Irish <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b> Ken Loach&#8217;s excellent movie about Iraq, set in Liverpool. A difficult concept, brilliantly executed, with a few stark messages for us all. A little violent in places, but not remotely gratuitous.</p>
<p><b> Source Code</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent psychological thriller.</p>
<p><b>Se7en</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Gruesome but clever serial killer movie with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Much of what Brad mumbles is inaudible, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>
<p><b>Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Actually not at all bad. Excellent effects as usual and very good acting all round. My only problem&#8230; I&#8217;m not all that keen on Harry himself.</p>
<p><b>Anatomy of a Murder </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Another old favourite that hasn&#8217;t worn well. Jimmy Stewart in a courtroom battle, to the accompaniment of an over-enthusiastic jazz soundtrack by Duke Ellington.  I don&#8217;t see it myself.</p>
<p><span style="color:magenta;"><b>Fanny and Alexander</b></span> <span style="color:black;"><img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /></span> Ingmar Bergman&#8217;s late family drama, much warmer than most of Bergman&#8217;s creations. Outstanding experience, somewhat haunted by the knowledge that we were watching not the three hour cinema release, nor the five hour tv series, but a cut version of the five hour one, running about four hours. I saw part of the tv series years ago, and identified a couple of omitted scenes. <a href="http://palimpsest.org.uk/forum/showpost.php?p=126738&amp;postcount=22" target="_blank">Fuller review here.</a></p>
<p><span style="color:magenta;"><b>Downfall</b></span> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent re-enactment of the last days in Hitler&#8217;s bunker. OK, we all know what happened, but seeing it unfolding on the screen, with wonderful cinematography, was unforgettable.</p>
<p><b>Knight and Day </b> <img class="inlineimg" title="A Big Turd" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_turd.gif" alt="" border="0" />. Totally unbelievable over-the-top stupid violence and effects. I lasted about ten minutes, by which time the body count must have been in the dozens. Tom Cruise fitted this movie. Cameron Diaz didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Unknown </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Quite a good movie on a familiar theme to a number of American movies. American arrives in Europe and has his identity questioned. (see <b>Frantic, The Bourne *, </b>others I forget). Competently made and not over-the-top. Liam Neeson stars.</p>
<p><b>Sherlock Holmes </b>(the Guy Ritchie one) <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Spectacular, but over-violent, new case for the famous sleuth. Set at some point between 1892 and 1894 (judging by views of Eros and the incomplete Tower Bridge), it contains much steampunk, some excellent cgi scenery of Victorian London, and an excess of fist fights, brawls and explosions.</p>
<p><b>White Ribbon <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /></b> Well-thought-of, Oscar-nominated, German film set in pre-First World War Germany. In black and white, rather harrowing, puzzling rather than mysterious. Beautifully filmed, but very uncomfortable viewing and desperately slow. I wanted to like it better, but it was too bleak.</p>
<p><b>Postcards from the Edge</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Mildly entertaining, well-acted by Shirley McLaine and Meryl Streep, but ultimately unsatisfactory drama, adapted from Carrie Fisher&#8217;s account of her relationship with mother Debbie Reynolds.</p>
<p><b>After.Life</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Living proof that a gripping movie doesn&#8217;t need car chases and shoot-outs to be totally gripping. A minimum of special effects, Christina Ricci and Liam Neeson combine to entertain. Actually, this movie seems to have been generally badly received, but not in this household.</p>
<p><b>Total Recall</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Another example of a good story spoilt by a ridiculous level of violence (see Inception). The high spot is when the large lady&#8217;s disguise peels off to reveal Arnie Schwartzenegger.</p>
<p><b>Witches</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Delightful children&#8217;s movie. Full of well-cast actors, great Muppet effects, tense in parts. (Warning: no car chases or shoot&#8217;em&#8217;ups)</p>
<p><b>Inception</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Acknowledging effort and effects, but a movie that&#8217;ll be soon forgotten. <a href="http://palimpsest.org.uk/forum/showpost.php?p=126203&amp;postcount=82" target="_blank">see review</a></p>
<p><b>Ivan the Terrible Part 2 <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b> I&#8217;m giving this 3 stars out of sentimentality, I think. This sequel to Part 1 is slow to the point of stationary, and adds little to Part 1 other than a splash of colour half way through. It was made at the same time as Brief Encounter and Passport to Pimlico, for example, but it feels much older. Eisenstein was a great movie maker, but things have moved on.</p>
<p><b>The Sorceror&#8217;s Apprentice</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I can&#8217;t believe I watched 20 minutes of this. It&#8217;s a kids&#8217; movie, but Nicolas Cage is better than this overblown fantasy.</p>
<p><b>Case Histories</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> BBC tv. Excellent 6-part tv series based on Kate Atkinson&#8217;s books. Great casting, Great photography. Atkinson plot complexity. Great Edinburgh locations. Recommended when they repeat it, as they certainly will.</p>
<p><b>The King&#8217;s Speech</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Jolly fine movie. Great acting all round. Engaging story. Geoffrey Rush particularly good. But I can&#8217;t see me wanting to watch it again, which is the mark of a great movie for me.</p>
<p><b>Black Swan</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Carried the air of not knowing where it was coming from or where it was going. Unnecessary girl porn. Unclear schizoid delusions. Left a bad taste in the mouth. Having said that, Natalie Portman did a great job with terrible material. Without her, it would have been straight to DVD. As it was, they got an Oscar nomination for it.</p>
<p><span style="color:magenta;"><b>The Secret in their Eyes</b></span> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Absolute treasure of an Argentinian crime movie. That very rare thing, a movie that kept us on the edge of our seats from start to finish. Entertaining on every level from cinematography through music to acting and direction. dir: Juan Jose Campanella.</p>
<p><b>Ill-met by Moonlight</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> I had long treasured nostalgic memories of this b&amp;w classic about the kidnap of a German general on Crete in WWII. The repeat viewing was disappointing. Dirk Bogarde as Patrick Leigh Fermor (not entirely wrong casting), the whole thing extremely stagey with very obvious indoor sets and jolly Greek peasants. Ugh.</p>
<p><b>Beverley Hills Cop II</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> subtitled in Greek, but it didn&#8217;t improve by re-watching.</p>
<p><b>The Life of David Gale</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Cracking good Death Row movie, with Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet. Well-plotted, full of little surprises, recommended.</p>
<p><b>Chungking Express</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent Chinese language movie from Hong Kong. Such vibrant photography, great lighting, interesting locations, lots of activity. A bit like the street atmosphere of Bladerunner. Only problem was the story, which falls into two parts, and seems to have been made up as they went along, so it didn&#8217;t always make a lot of sense, but I&#8217;d watch another film fom the same stable (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong_Kar-wai" target="_blank">Wong Kar-wai</a>) in a flash.</p>
<p><b>The Tailor of Panama</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Old VHS recording. I don&#8217;t know what I saw in this le Carre adaptation the first time. Probably just the plot, because the movie itself is pretty second-rate &#8211; it appears low-budget and hurriedly made. Geoffrey Rush, the tailor himself, is the star, Jamie Lee Curtis stuck in there incongruously, Pierce Brosnan doing his Roger Moore impersonation.</p>
<p><b>Greenberg</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Ben Stiller being unnaturally gnomic. I&#8217;m not all that keen on Ben Stiller, even when he&#8217;s doing what he&#8217;s best at. It looked as if it was destined to be a quirky romcom. As soon as I detected that, I was outathere. Sorry, Ben, but you got one star. It could have been one of these <img class="inlineimg" title="A Big Turd" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_turd.gif" alt="" border="0" />, but the movie wasn&#8217;t bad enough.</p>
<p><b>The Lovely Bones</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Strange one, this. The filming was excellent, and the special effects very good. It was just such a soppy story incongruously wrapped up in a murder. The scenes in heaven were&#8230; unconvincing. Frankly, I think it would have done better as a police procedural thriller.</p>
<p><b>1984 <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b> Deeply depressing, yet masterly, version of the Orwell novel. John Hurt and Richard Burton. It seems to me that it is very close to the plot and original atmosphere of the book.</p>
<p><b>Agora <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b> Promising, apparently original, story of a lady philosopher in ancient Alexandria. Very nice cgi recreations of Alexandria, but I abandoned it after 20 minutes when it hadn&#8217;t gripped me.</p>
<p><b>Awakenings <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b> Brilliantly acted, highly emotional, (almost) true story of a doctor who finds a way of re-animating catatonic patients decades after their catatonia commenced. Robin Williams is the doctor. Robert di Nero the principal patient.</p>
<p><b>Robin Hood (the 2008 version) </b> <img class="inlineimg" title="A Big Turd" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_turd.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Despite the fact that this movie, like Gladiator (which I quite enjoyed), was partly filmed in our local woods, was based on a &#8216;history&#8217; that never happened, starred Russell Crowe, and was directed by Ridley Scott, there is no comparison between the quality of the movies. Even the Costner comedic version was better. Garbled crap from beginning to end, and the end is at the point where most Robin Hood stories begin!</p>
<p><b>A Serious Man </b> <img class="inlineimg" title="A Big Turd" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_turd.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Total waste of time. I&#8217;ve learned to equate &#8220;quirky&#8221; in a movie description with an entertainment value somewhere between <i>Pants </i>and <i>Meh</i>. This one was at the low end.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:magenta;">Kenneth Macmillan Triple Bill</span> </b><b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /></b> 3 Macmillan ballets from The Royal Ballet. The standout winner of the three is <b>Elite Syncopations</b>, based on Joplin&#8217;s music with fantastic cheeky costumes. Highly recommended, even if you don&#8217;t like ballet.</p>
<p><b>La Boheme</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Great Australian Opera version of the opera with the EXCELLENT David Hobson.</p>
<p><b>The Mikado</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Excellent Jonathan Miller version of the G &amp; S operetta, with Eric Idle and Lesley Garrett.</p>
<p><b>Equus</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Disturbing story, but very watchable. Richard Burton very powerful in this.</p>
<p><b>Bolt</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Yuk. Hated it. OK, it&#8217;s a kids&#8217; movie, but unsatisfactory.</p>
<p><b>The Fortune Cookie </b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Matthau and Lemmon comedy which hasn&#8217;t worn well. I liked it back in the 60s, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" />. Very pretty movie, this. Not easy for me to summarise because on the two occasions I&#8217;ve seen it, it has had a severely soporific effect on me, but, while I was awake, it was beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Leap Year</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Engaging, trivial romcom enlivened by stunning Irish scenery.</p>
<p><b>Les Regles du Jeu </b>DVD. <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> A famous film which did not impress. Too many strident characters overacting. I couldn&#8217;t evince any interest in any of them.</p>
<p><b>Repo Men</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Initially promising feature about spare parts surgery which rapidly descended into a blood-soaked carve-&#8217;em-up which went on too long and ended with a cheap trick. Only escaped with two stars because of Jude Law.</p>
<p><b>Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Amusing star-studded children&#8217;s movie. The cgi piglets were wonderful, the villain villainous, the children more than usually acceptable actors. Kids of all ages will enjoy it. We did.</p>
<p><b>Pulp Fiction</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> More repulsively violent than I remembered, but it retains its wry humour and expert filming. Disappointingly, there were no subtitles. I&#8217;m sure it might have been even more amusing if I could have made out all the dialogue.</p>
<p><b>Broken Embraces </b><img class="inlineimg" title="One Star" src="https://i2.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_onestar.gif" alt="" border="0" /> This Almodovar movie was most disappointing after the very excellent <b>Volver</b>. Any movie, though, that gives me a rather explicit casual sex scene in the first 5 minutes and 3 or 4 flashback/flashforward events in the first 20 minutes is going to receive the same treatment from me that this one did. Switch off, Eject. Also, the DVD mechanism for subtitles etc was extremely stupid and already had my dander up.</p>
<p><b>The Fourth Kind</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Absolutely chilling alien contact story, set in Alaska, and supported by (supposedly live) video and audio evidence for verisimilitude. It is presented as a drama documentary, and sometimes the drama is shown split screen with the video evidence. Worrying. It felt real.</p>
<p><b>Anamorph</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Great idea for a serial killer story. The killer arranges murder scenes into an optical illusion. But it doesn&#8217;t really work very well. The initial illusion, a <i>camera obscura</i>, would never work in practice. Most of the others are badly displayed, and the story is weak. Bit of a waste, really.</p>
<p><b>Black Widow</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Debra Winger in a very well thought-out murder hunt. No car chases, no shoot-outs, no special effects, no explosions, no sex scenes, no lavatory scenes, no vomiting, no swearing, no punch-ups. I can&#8217;t imagine why it was ever made in today&#8217;s climate.</p>
<p><b>Carlito&#8217;s Way</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Gripping thriller. Al Pacino stars. Brian Palma directs. You really <b>care</b> what happens. I should add that it is real tragedy. The hero puts himself in peril, not because of a bad trait, but because of loyalty, and he perishes because he showed mercy.</p>
<p><b>Ivan the Terrible Part 1 </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> DVD. Classic Eisenstein biopic of Csar Ivan IV, a contemporary of England&#8217;s Elizabeth I. It was made in 1943-44, but looks older. The framing of the movie is impeccable, the costumes, sets and extras lavish. Music by Prokofiev, great choral background. The use of posed figures and shadows deeply impressive. There is a pro-Stalin propaganda element, as Ivan attempts to unite the whole of Russia against Germans, Baltic states, Poland and Finland. There is a reference to English ships supplying Russia via the White Sea (cue the WW2 Murmansk convoys). I would have given it 5 stars, but it is very slow and the subtitles are very poor.</p>
<p><b>Millers Crossing </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Rather deadpan performance by Gabriel Byrne in a well-filmed prohibition-era gangster movie. Machiavellian plot interspersed with over the top gratuitous violence. Byrne survives repeated beatings without visible damage. Unsavoury, really.</p>
<p><b>Harry Brown</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> Initially glacially slow, the movie warms up to a rather predictable shoot-&#8217;em-up and riot. A gritty location in some hopeless multistory housing estate in England. If you fancy Michael Caine as an elderly hard man, and you enjoy rough sex, drugs, delinquents and sadism in your movies, you may enjoy it. I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:magenta;">Pan&#8217;s Labyrinth</span> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b> Beautifully filmed, often very grim, Spanish language movie about a) The remnants of the Spanish Civil War; b) A child&#8217;s relationship with her wicked stepfather; c) A fantasy quest. The whole is exquisitely cut to present the real and fantasy world living side by side in a very natural fashion. Recommended.</p>
<p><span style="color:magenta;"><b>Thelma and Louise</b></span> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> If you have never seen this movie, put it on your wishlist. Great road / crime movie, with Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, Michael Madsen, a sympathetic Harvey Keitel, a loathsome Brad Pitt, directed by Ridley Scott. Great scenery towards the end, a rousing country soundtrack, satisfying denouement. Recommended.</p>
<p><b>Moulin Rouge <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; <a href="http://palimpsest.org.uk/forum/showpost.php?p=123795&amp;postcount=9" target="_blank">See review</a></b></p>
<p><span style="color:magenta;"><b>Invictus</b></span> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; Very impressive movie, with Morgan Freeman as a credible Mandela, and Matt Damon as the rather laconic rugby captain Pienaar. A rousing story of national reconciliation. Quite heart-warming in places, and not desperately far from the truth.</p>
<p><b>Where the Wild Things Are <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /></b> &#8211; Disappointing movie version of the much loved graphic children&#8217;s book. The Wild Things themselves were quite exciting, but the pace of the movie was lethargic, the back-story, absent from the book, was tedious. It didn&#8217;t grip.</p>
<p><b>Green Zone <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /></b> &#8211; Rather noisy and busy Iraq War conspiracy theory movie, with Matt Damon doing a &#8220;Jason Bourne&#8221; solo hero job. Set dressing, CGI and military hardware excellent. Story rather believable. Acting, not bad; all the main cast were convincing. Most characters did a lot of rushing around ruined buildings, brandishing weapons.</p>
<p><b>The 300 Spartans &#8211; </b><img class="inlineimg" title="A Big Turd" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_turd.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; Not the recent &#8220;300&#8221;, but a similar story with a 1962 star-studded cast in togas on cardboard sets. Absolute Hollywood tosh. Ditched it 20 minutes in when the first love scene began, set in a studio with bushes, rocks and bad acting.</p>
<p><b>Mon Oncle </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; DVD. Jacques Tati, but not only Tati; an excellent supporting cast of machines, people, dogs and a horse. Imaginative send-up of modern (1950s) living, and charming, as ever.</p>
<p><b>Synecdoche, New York </b><img class="inlineimg" title="A Big Turd" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_turd.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; I think a director has a duty to get me hooked on a movie within the first five minutes. Five minutes into this one, and all I knew was that the child was worried her morning poop was green in colour. I gave it another five. Then I ditched it. Crap.</p>
<p><span style="color:magenta;"><b>Master and Commander</b></span> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; Totally terrific again on this third viewing.</p>
<p><b>Ghost Dog <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> </b>&#8211; DVD. Actually quite liked this Forest Whitaker movie where he is a mafia hit man who follows the way of the samurai. Sensitively filmed and without the blood you might expect from such a production.</p>
<p><b>Zen &#8211; Ratking </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; tv movie, Again, I liked the ambience, but the plot of this bears NO RESEMBLANCE AT ALL to the book, and was not properly worked out. Sheesh.</p>
<p><b>Zen &#8211; Cabal</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Two Stars" src="https://i0.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_twostars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; tv movie, quite well done, but it has drifted so far from the book which I read recently, and not in a good way, unlike Vendetta.</p>
<p><b>Jour de Fête</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> DVD. &#8211; An early Jacques Tati classic. This was the recently restored colour one, and it&#8217;s not as good as the b &amp; w version that I remember. The pacing is different. I think they haven&#8217;t edited it the same way as the original. Having said that, I laughed from beginning to end. You can&#8217;t help it.</p>
<p><b>Alice in Wonderland </b><img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; the Tim Burton one. I wasn&#8217;t expecting much of this, especially since it was HDTV, rather than cinema 3D. However, it was very agreeable, consistently interesting and, I suspect, would have been rather exhausting in 3D.</p>
<p><b>Wallander &#8211; Pyramid</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; tv movie, not very close to the book, but Rolf Lassgård does a lovely job.</p>
<p><b>Zen &#8211; Vendetta</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; tv movie, good adaptation of the book, slight plot changes, mostly for the better.</p>
<p><b>The Danish Girl</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; Well-made, well-acted, harrowing biopic of a transgender person. Not really entertaining, but not to be missed.</p>
<p><b>Wild Oats</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Three Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_threestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; Comedy with Shirley Mclaine. Mildly entertaining. Great music, particularly over the titles.</p>
<p><b>I Saw the Light</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; Biopic of Hank Williams, starring Tom Hiddleston, who, remarkably, actually sings Hank&#8217;s famous songs throughout the movie, in a manner indistinguishable from the original.</p>
<p><b>Florence Foster Jenkins</b> <img class="inlineimg" title="Four Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fourstars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; Biopic of FFJ&#8217;s latter days, with Meryl Streep, boldly rendering Florence&#8217;s execrable voice, accompanied by Simon Helberg (Howard from The Big Bang Theory). Hugh Grant plays&#8230; well&#8230; Hugh Grant.</p>
<p><span style="color:magenta;"><b>The Magnificent Seven (1960)</b></span> <img class="inlineimg" title="Five Stars" src="https://i1.wp.com/mythaxis.co.uk/icon_fivestars.gif" alt="" border="0" /> &#8211; Totally terrific even after all these years. I particularly noticed how smoothly Yul Brynner moves in the movie. The music, of course, has also stood the test of time. The original Kurosawa movie &#8211; 7 Samurai &#8211; was the inspiration for the movie, and it was excellent, and ground-breaking in many ways, but there&#8217;s something perfect about The Magnificent Seven.</p>
