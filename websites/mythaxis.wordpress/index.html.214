					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic. A brilliant edition. THE essential edition of Leonardo&#039;s beautiful work. If you have not read this, you do not know Leonardo.

The writer of this article is quite correct to complain of Dan Brown. Not one single thing in the silly Da Vinci Code is correct about Leonardo. Reading the full English translation of his writings by Edward MacCurdy, it becomes clear that Leonardo was an immensely religious man (for instance.) He seems to have been a fairly devout Catholic. I make an example of this here. 

Leonardo says:

&quot;God sells us all things at the price of labor.&quot;

&quot;Fame alone raises herself to Heaven, because virtuous things are in favour with God.&quot;

&quot;We, by our arts may be called the grandsons of God.&quot;

&quot;Good Report soars and rises to heaven, for virtuous things find favor with God. Evil Report should be shown inverted, for all her works are contrary to God and tend toward hell.&quot;

&quot;If the Lord—who is the light of all things—vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat of Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts . . . Linear Perspective, The Perspective of Colour, The Perspective of Disappearance.&quot;

&quot;The definition of the soul I leave to the imaginations of the friars, those fathers of the people who know all secrets by inspiration. I leave alone the sacred books; for they are SUPREME TRUTH.” (my emphasis)

And, near the end of his life, Leonardo wrote:

“I have offended God and man because my work didn&#039;t reach the quality it should have.”

Taken all together rather than alone, these statements make a compelling case for the &quot;Catholic&quot; Leonardo Da Vinci. There many more such statements in his work. This is just a tiny sampling. Anyone contending that Leonardo was a non-Catholic nature worshipping pagan will have to deal with these writings first. They are formidable indeed. 

Reading the MacCurdy translation of Leonardo&#039;s notes is like reading a medieval religious text. It is PROFOUNDLY Catholic. I am shocked that the religious writings of Leonardo Da Vinci have been so completely ignored and suppressed by the so-called scholars of the world. Virtually nobody mentions them. One has to go back to his original notes to see what he himself was writing.

There are many other such hidden things that only Leonardo&#039;s notebooks will give you. One is his astounding grasp of stellar phenomenon. Another is his amazingly thorough investigations of physical processes. He must have stared at sand for hours to understand how sound vibrations cause it to move, and in what strange volcanic patterns.

You will also become aware of his shocking blunders. For example, Leonardo thought the moon was covered with water. This, he thought, explained its luminescence at night. He was wrong about that. But it was a brilliantly reasoned mistake. He arrived at it by a rational process. Many of his other reasoned conclusions are shockingly insightful. (He correctly theorized about why the sky looks blue, for instance.)

I have barely begun reading this masterpiece. Already I am discovering a person completely different from that portrayed by many other foolish authors and silly scholars - most of whom seem to function according to some agenda other than the truth.  

What a fantastic set of volumes. Read it and be enlightened.]]></description>
