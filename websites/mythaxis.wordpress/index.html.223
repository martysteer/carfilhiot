					<description><![CDATA[Two years later I am now reading Ransome to my youngest daughter, aged 8, as our bedtime story.   She loved &#039;Swallows and Amazons&#039; and we&#039;re now reading &#039;Swallowdale&#039;.  Kids are sponges, accepting and open-eyed for wonder in whatever form it comes.  Last night she was hypnotised by the CGI nonsense of Doctor Who&#039;s &#039;Dinosaurs on a Spaceship&#039;, half an hour later she was climbing Kanchenjunga with the Swallows.  I think I know which was was the more real for her and will last the longer in her memory.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I rattled through Ransome&#039;s books when I was a kid, I must have been around ten to twelve.  Everything I know about boats, sailing, and being attacked by Chinese pirates comes from his books.  I&#039;ve never been sailing - I think I was scared off by reading &#039;We Didn&#039;t Mean to Go To Sea&#039; which terrified me. Scenes from the books remain vividly in my mind despite me not having read them for over thirty years]]></description>
