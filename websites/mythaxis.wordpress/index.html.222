<p>Neuromancer, William Gibson&#8217;s first full-length novel, written in 1983, rightly occupies an important place in Science Fiction. </p>
<p>It forms a loose trilogy with <em>Count Zero</em> and <em>Mona Lisa Overdrive</em>, and the three books are often called &#8220;The Sprawl Trilogy&#8221;. It is the work which started the so-called Cyberpunk movement, though Gibson himself never uses the expression, and has moved on to more conventional writing. Many writers have mimicked Gibson&#8217;s style without the same success. Rather than attempting to define Cyberpunk, let me enumerate the main components of Neuromancer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main protagonist, Case, is what we would now call a hacker. He is also a criminal, having stolen from his employers and killed a number of fellow criminals. He is no stranger to drugs.</li>
<li>Case&#8217;s partner, Molly, is a professional strong-arm woman with artificial implants to enhance her deadly capabilities.</li>
<li>Cyberspace (Gibson&#8217;s invention) is a sort of virtual reality version of the worldwide web. Gibson anticipates the web by about a decade. It is the medium in which Case&#8217;s work is performed.</li>
<li>Body implants are commonplace in the world of Neuromancer. Implants range from organs to hardware, computing devices and weapons.</li>
<li>Inhabited satellites circle the Earth.</li>
<li>Computers with considerable Artificial Intelligence exist, kept under control by the &#8220;Turing Police&#8221;.</li>
<li>EEG-type devices permit emotions and experiences to be recorded, mass-reproduced and sold as recordings.</li>
<li>Exotic weapons abound.</li>
<li>An expert system, based on an actual person, living or dead, can be encapsulated on a ROM and used as though the person were actually present.</li>
<li>The action takes place in Japan, in Istanbul and in orbit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neuromancer is set in a worn and grubby future like the movies Bladerunner and Alien. The themes and atmosphere of the Matrix movies are sometimes said to be inspired by Neuromancer, but I don&#8217;t see it myself. However, I do often spot two-dimensional shadows of Neuromancer&#8217;s influence leaking into other science fiction, especially cyberpunk. Violence is also an important feature of Neuromancer, a feature that becomes less prominent in Gibson&#8217;s subsequent work. The plot is played out as a single third person account from the point of view of Case. Most of Gibson&#8217;s later books, including the other two novels in the trilogy, are told from multiple points of view. The plot is nevertheless complex. There are a number of memorable characters in it, notably Dixie Flatline, who is not actually present, and Finn &#8211; the ultimate <em>gomi</em> collector and professional nerd.</p>
<p>Of course, science fiction often flourishes only by virtue of cool ideas, and Neuromancer is not short of these. But that is not the whole story. The language is also spell-binding. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#8217;d found her, one rainy night, in an arcade.<br />
Under bright ghosts burning through a blue haze of cigarette smoke,<br />
holograms of Wizard&#8217;s Castle, Tank War Europa, the New York skyline&#8230;.<br />
And now he remembered her that way, her face bathed in restless laser<br />
light, features reduced to a code: her cheekbones flaring scarlet as<br />
Wizard&#8217;s Castle burned, forehead drenched with azure when Munich fell<br />
to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck<br />
sparks from the wall of a skyscraper canyon. He was riding high that<br />
night, with a brick of Wage&#8217;s ketamine on its way to Yokohama and the<br />
money already in his pocket. He&#8217;d come in out of the warm rain that<br />
sizzled across the Ninsei pavement and somehow she&#8217;d been singled out<br />
for him, one face out of the dozens who stood at the consoles, lost in<br />
the game she played. The expression on her face, then, had been the one<br />
he&#8217;d seen, hours later, on her sleeping face in a port side [hotel room], her<br />
upper lip like the line children draw to represent a bird in flight.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gibson&#8217;s style has been called &#8216;verb-light&#8217;, but that may be because he is &#8216;description-heavy&#8217;. There are characteristic rhythms and repetitions in his descriptions which render his prose so very recognisable.</p>
<blockquote><p>The antique arm whined as he reached for another mug. It<br />
was a Russian military prosthesis, a seven-function force-feedback<br />
manipulator, cased in grubby pink plastic.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> a flat lozenge of vat grown flesh that lay on a carved pedestal of imitation jade.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>she lit it for him with a thin slab of German steel that looked as<br />
though it belonged on an operating table.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Neuromancer did not appear from nowhere. Gibson&#8217;s early short stories, for example: <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em>, <em>Fragments of a Hologram Rose </em>and <em>Burning Chrome</em>,  foreshadowed the background. </p>
<p>However, back in the 1980s, Gibson professed no particular expertise with the cyberspace technology about which he wrote so fluently, and the tale that he wrote his early books on a battered portable typewriter is at least partially true. This unfamiliarity with computer technology actually freed him to invent concepts that still feel fresh and original even to a life-long software engineer like me. Case&#8217;s interface with cyberspace more resembles spaceflight than it does the Web of today.</p>
<p>The same lack of detailed knowledge has the additional advantage that Neuromancer is not filled with technical explanation. The technology is presented as a <I>fait accompli</I> and the reader just has to accept the &#8216;what&#8217; without knowing the &#8216;how&#8217;.</p>
<p>Having said that, Gibson is an accomplished observer of society, and has a knack of knowing how people at large &#8211; &#8216;the street&#8217; as he calls it &#8211; will find a use for new developments.</p>
<p>What of the future for Neuromancer&#8217;s reputation? Hollywood keeps threatening to produce Neuromancer &#8211; the Movie. I shudder at the thought. Everything but the fight scenes would be ditched, and so much gratuitous gung-ho would be added as to render it unpalatable.</p>
<p>I re-read Neuromancer again recently. For me, it has lost none of its quality over the quarter century since it was written. Let&#8217;s keep it in book form, set it as a school reader, respect it for the classic it undoubtedly is.</p>
