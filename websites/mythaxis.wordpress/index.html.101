<p>As promised, from now on, prizes will be awarded to the most popular stories in each edition of Mythaxis.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s edition contains stories from regular contributors and from Tom Sheehan, a new author to Mythaxis, though he already has a distinguished portfolio of published work.</p>
<p>There are two strange contributions from Les Sklaroff and one from Peter Morrison, a couple of thrillers from Martin Clark, creepy little tales from Tom Davies and Andrew Leon Hudson, and a grim game-related cyberpunkish offering from Twilite Minotaur. There&#8217;s even a little sting in the tale from yours truly.</p>
<p><a href="http://mythaxis.co.uk">READ IT HERE</a></p>
<p>Enjoy&#8230; AND VOTE!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From now on, the editors at Mythaxis will be awarding prizes to the three best short stories in every edition, as voted by the editing team and readers. In keeping with the literary nature of our publication, these prizes will be in the form of books rather than money.</p>
<p>Let me be more precise. I have a large collection of books, mostly science fiction and fantasy, many very old in sf terms. Often, these books are no longer readily available, for various reasons (out of print, under-appreciated, magazine editions).</p>
<p>On <a href="http://mythaxis.co.uk/prizes.htm">this page</a>, I have posted descriptions of ten books. If you win, you get to choose your prize from the books available.</p>
<p>So. This is a call for short stories for issue 12 of Mythaxis.</p>
<p>Closing date? Well, editors always need the text as soon as possible, but we can&#8217;t guarantee to include anythingÂ  we receive after 20 February. </p>

<p>With this issue, its tenth, Mythaxis has<br />
moved into double figures. And a fine edition it is, too.</p>
<p>We have another great story, a haunting one at that, from Les Sklaroff.</p>
<p>Martin Clark contributes a sequel &#8211; &#8220;All Avenues Closed&#8221; to the story he<br />
gave us in issue 9 &#8211; &#8220;Let Every Voice be Still&#8221;. </p>
<p>Matthew Kirshenblatt delivers an atmospheric little story based on a<br />
missing chapter.</p>
<p>Tom Davies contributes a weird little nightmare.</p>
<p>My own modest effort about an unusual NIMBY situation now seems rather<br />
bland in comparison to the fevered imaginations of our other authors.</p>
<p>The issue is rounded off with two unconnected and separately contributed<br />
stories of personal development from Andrew Leon Hudson and Jonathan<br />
Joseph. When you read them you will understand why I felt compelled to<br />
head them with fragments from Hieronymous Bosch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are proud that<a title="Mythaxis magazine" href="http://mythaxis.co.uk" target="_blank"> Mythaxis magazine</a> has been running now since 2008 with nine issues so far. Many webzines collapse very much more quickly. My original intention was to present a science fiction and fantasy literary magazine with a faÃ§ade that more closely resembled New Worlds magazine than some of the web-based sites that seem to exist to promote movies, tv series and sequels thereof.</p>
<p>I think we have succeeded in displaying some new talent in writing, and I am constantly pleased at the standard of our contributors. The only area I think I would like to see in future issues is some sf and fantasy art. I make it clear on the site that we are open to graphic content, but, so far, only Liam Baldwin&#8217;s cartoons (good though they certainly are) have appeared.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mythaxis continues to expand its readership without resort to cheap tricks and vampire movie reviews. We do not publish to a deadline, and can afford to wait until the right stories come along, which they have done in this issue once again.</p>
<p><a href="http://mythaxis.co.uk">Latest issue &#8211; issue 8 of Mythaxis Magazine.<br />
</a></p>
<p>In particular, Les Sklaroff, lifelong writer of very short fiction, has supplied us with two unlikely tales, &#8220;Conspiracy Theory&#8221; and &#8220;Spawn&#8221; and he promises more delights in our next issue.</p>
<p>Martin Clark unleashes another excellent story &#8211; &#8220;The Great Divide&#8221; &#8211; a thriller within a fantasy within a mystery.</p>
<p>This issue&#8217;s featured science fiction author of old is Lester Linesmith. There is an &#8216;original&#8217; story from Linesmith together with an incisive biography of this pillar of the pulp era by Liam Baldwin. Liam&#8217;s movie blog was recently highlighted by BBC Radio 4&#8217;s Film programme. (He specialises in what you might call B-movies, or C-movies, if there were such a category).</p>
<p>&#8220;The Prophets Speak&#8221;, from Andrew Critchley, carries a clever idea to an ingenious extreme.</p>
<p>The chilling &#8220;Outpatients&#8221;, from Jonathan Joseph, completes this issue. You will not readily forget the pictures he leaves in your minds.</p>
<p>And where would we be without a cartoon from Liam Baldwin? Answers on a postcard, please.</p>
