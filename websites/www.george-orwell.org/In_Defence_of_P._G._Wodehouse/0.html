<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">When the Germans made their rapid advance through Belgium in the early<br>summer of 1940, they captured, among other things, Mr. P. G. Wodehouse,<br>who had been living throughout the early part of the war in his villa at<br>Le Touquet, and seems not to have realised until the last moment that he<br>was in any danger. As he was led away into captivity, he is said to have<br>remarked, "Perhaps after this I shall write a serious book." He was<br>placed for the time being under house arrest, and from his subsequent<br>statements it appears that he was treated in a fairly friendly way,<br>German officers in the neighbourhood frequently "dropping in for a bath<br>or a party".<br><br>Over a year later, on 25th June 1941, the news came that Wodehouse had<br>been released from internment and was living at the Adlon Hotel in<br>Berlin. On the following day the public was astonished to learn that he<br>had agreed to do some broadcasts of a "non-political" nature over the<br>German radio. The full texts of these broadcasts are not easy to obtain<br>at this date, but Wodehouse seems to have done five of them between 26th<br>June and 2nd July, when the Germans took him off the air again. The first<br>broadcast, on 26th June, was not made on the Nazi radio but took the form<br>of an interview with Harry Flannery, the representative of the Columbia<br>Broadcasting System, which still had its correspondents in Berlin.<br>Wodehouse also published in the SATURDAY EVENING POST an article which he<br>had written while still in the internment camp.<br><br>The article and the broadcasts dealt mainly with Wodehouse's experiences<br>in internment, but they did include a very few comments on the war. The<br>following are fair samples:<br><br><br>"I never was interested in politics. I'm quite unable to work up any kind<br>of belligerent feeling. Just as I'm about to feel belligerent about some<br>country I meet a decent sort of chap. We go out together and lose any<br>fighting thoughts or feelings."<br><br>"A short time ago they had a look at me on parade and got the right idea;<br>at least they sent us to the local lunatic asylum. And I have been there<br>forty-two weeks. There is a good deal to be said for internment. It keeps<br>you out of the saloon and helps you to keep up with your reading. The<br>chief trouble is that it means you are away from home for a long time.<br>When I join my wife I had better take along a letter of introduction to<br>be on the safe side."<br><br>"In the days before the war I had always been modestly proud of being an<br>Englishman, but now that I have been some months resident in this bin or<br>repository of Englishmen I am not so sure... The only concession I want<br>from Germany is that she gives me a loaf of bread, tells the gentlemen<br>with muskets at the main gate to look the other way, and leaves the rest<br>to me. In return I am prepared to hand over India, an autographed set of<br>my books, and to reveal the secret process of cooking sliced potatoes on<br>a radiator. This offer holds good till Wednesday week."<br><br><br>The first extract quoted above caused great offence. Wodehouse was also<br>censured for using (in the interview with Flannery) the phrase "whether<br>Britain wins the war or not," and he did not make things better by<br>describing in another broadcast the filthy habits of some Belgian<br>prisoners among whom he was interned. The Germans recorded this broadcast<br>and repeated it a number of times. They seem to have supervised his talks<br>very lightly, and they allowed him not only to be funny about the<br>discomforts of internment but to remark that "the internees at Trost camp<br>all fervently believe that Britain will eventually win." The general<br>upshot of the talks, however, was that he had not been ill treated and<br>bore no malice.<br><br>These broadcasts caused an immediate uproar in England. There were<br>questions in Parliament, angry editorial comments in the press, and a<br>stream of letters from fellow-authors, nearly all of them disapproving,<br>though one or two suggested that it would be better to suspend judgment,<br>and several pleaded that Wodehouse probably did not realise what he was<br>doing. On 15th July, the Home Service of the B.B.C. carried an extremely<br>violent Postscript by "Cassandra" of the DAILY MIRROR, accusing Wodehouse<br>of "selling his country." This postscript made free use of such<br>expressions as "Quisling" and "worshipping the Fìhrer". The main charge<br>was that Wodehouse had agreed to do German propaganda as a way of buying<br>himself out of the internment camp.<br><br>"Cassandra's" Postscript caused a certain amount of protest, but on the<br>whole it seems to have intensified popular feeling against Wodehouse. One<br>result of it was that numerous lending libraries withdrew Wodehouse's<br>books from circulation. Here is a typical news item:<br><br><br>"Within twenty-four hours of listening to the broadcast of Cassandra, the<br>DAILY MIRROR columnist, Portadown (North Ireland) Urban District Council<br>banned P. G. Wodehouse's books from their public library. Mr. Edward<br>McCann said that Cassandra's broadcast had clinched the matter. Wodehouse<br>was funny no longer." (DAILY MIRROR.)<br><br><br>In addition the B.B.C. banned Wodehouse's lyrics from the air and was<br>still doing so a couple of years later. As late as December 1944 there<br>were demands in Parliament that Wodehouse should be put on trial as a<br>traitor.<br><br>There is an old saying that if you throw enough mud some of it will<br>stick, and the mud has stuck to Wodehouse in a rather peculiar way. An<br>impression has been left behind that Wodehouse's talks (not that anyone<br>remembers what he said in them) showed him up not merely as a traitor but<br>as an ideological sympathiser with Fascism. Even at the time several<br>letters to the press claimed that "Fascist tendencies" could be detected<br>in his books, and the charge has been repeated since. I shall try to<br>analyse the mental atmosphere of those books in a moment, but it is<br>important to realise that the events of 1941 do not convict Wodehouse of<br>anything worse than stupidity. The really interesting question is how and<br>why he could be so stupid. When Flannery met Wodehouse (released, but<br>still under guard) at the Adlon Hotel in June 1941, he saw at once that<br>he was dealing with a political innocent, and when preparing him for<br>their broadcast interview he had to warn him against making some<br>exceedingly unfortunate remarks, one of which was by implication slightly<br>anti-Russian. As it was, the phrase "whether England wins or not" did get<br>through. Soon after the interview Wodehouse told him that he was also<br>going to broadcast on the Nazi radio, apparently not realising that this<br>action had any special significance. Flannery comments [ASSIGNMENT TO<br>BERLIN by Harry W. Flannery.]:<br><br><br>"By this time the Wodehouse plot was evident. It was one of the best Nazi<br>publicity stunts of the war, the first with a human angle. ...Plack<br>(Goebbels's assistant) had gone to the camp near Gleiwitz to see<br>Wodehouse, found that the author was completely without political sense,<br>and had an idea. He suggested to Wodehouse that in return for being<br>released from the prison camp he write a series of broadcasts about his<br>experiences; there would be no censorship and he would put them on the<br>air himself. In making that proposal Plack showed that he knew his man.<br>He knew that Wodehouse made fun of the English in all his stories and<br>that he seldom wrote in any other way, that he was still living in the<br>period about which he wrote and had no conception of Nazism and all it<br>meant. Wodehouse was his own Bertie Wooster."<br><br><br>The striking of an actual bargain between Wodehouse and Plack seems to be<br>merely Flannery's own interpretation. The arrangement may have been of a<br>much less definite kind, and to judge from the broadcasts themselves,<br>Wodehouse's main idea in making them was to keep in touch with his public<br>and — the comedian's ruling passion — to get a laugh. Obviously they are<br>not the utterances of a Quisling of the type of Ezra Pound or John Amery,<br>nor, probably, of a person capable of understanding the nature of<br>Quislingism. Flannery seems to have warned Wodehouse that it would be<br>unwise to broadcast, but not very forcibly. He adds that Wodehouse<br>(though in one broadcast he refers to himself as an Englishman) seemed to<br>regard himself as an American citizen. He had contemplated<br>naturalisation, but had never filled in the necessary papers. He even<br>used, to Flannery, the phrase, "We're not at war with Germany."<br><br>I have before me a bibliography of P. G. Wodehouse's works. It names<br>round about fifty books, but is certainly incomplete. It is as well to be<br>honest, and I ought to start by admitting that there are many books by<br>Wodehouse perhaps a quarter or a third of the total — which I have not<br>read. It is not, indeed, easy to read the whole output of a popular<br>writer who is normally published in cheap editions. But I have followed<br>his work fairly closely since 1911, when I was eight years old, and am<br>well acquainted with its peculiar mental atmosphere — an atmosphere which<br>has not, of course, remained completely unchanged, but shows little<br>alteration since about 1925. In the passage from Flannery's book which I<br>quoted above there are two remarks which would immediately strike any<br>attentive reader of Wodehouse. One is to the effect that Wodehouse "was<br>still living in the period about which he wrote," and the other that the<br>Nazi Propaganda Ministry made use of him because he "made fun of the<br>English." The second statement is based on a misconception to which I<br>will return presently. But Flannery's other comment is quite true and<br>contains in it part of the clue to Wodehouse's behaviour.<br><br>A thing that people often forget about P. G. Wodehouse's novels is how<br>long ago the better-known of them were written. We think of him as in<br>some sense typifying the silliness of the nineteen-twenties and<br>nineteen-thirties, but in fact the scenes and characters by which he is<br>best remembered had all made their appearance before 1925. Psmith first<br>appeared in 1909, having been foreshadowed by other characters in early<br>school stories. Blandings Castle, with Baxter and the Earl of Emsworth both<br>in residence, was introduced in 1915. The Jeeves-Wooster cycle began<br>in 1919, both Jeeves and Wooster having made brief appearances earlier.<br>Ukridge appeared in 1924. When one looks through the list of Wodehouse's<br>books from 1902 onwards, one can observe three fairly well-marked periods.<br>The first is the school-story period. It includes such books as THE GOLD<br>BAT, THE POTHUNTERS, etc and has its high-spot in MIKE (1909). PSMITH IN<br>THE CITY, published in the following year, belongs in this category,<br>though it is not directly concerned with school life. The next is the<br>American period. Wodehouse seems to have lived in the United States<br>from about 1913 to 1920, and for a while showed signs of bECOMING<br>AMERICANISED IN IDIOM AND OUTLOOK. SOME OF THE STORIES IN THE MAN WITH<br>TWO LEFT FEET (1917) appear to have been influenced by 0. Henry, and<br>other books written about this time contain Americanisms (e.g. "highball"<br>for "whisky and soda") which an Englishman would not normally use IN<br>PROPRIA PERSONA. Nevertheless, almost all the books of this period--PSMITH,<br>JOURNALIST; THE LITTLE NUGGET; THE INDISCRETIONS OF ARCHIE; PICCADILLY<br>JIM and various others-depend for their effect on the CONTRAST between<br>English and American manners. English characters appear in an American<br>setting, or vice versa: there is a certain number of purely English stories,<br>but hardly any purely American ones. The third period might fitly be called<br>the country-house period. By the early nineteen-twenties Wodehouse must<br>have been making a very large income, and the social status of his<br>characters moved upwards accordingly, though the Ukridge stories form a<br>partial exception. The typical setting is now a country mansion, a<br>luxurious bachelor flat or an expensive golf club. The schoolboy<br>athleticism of the earlier books fades out, cricket and football giving<br>way to golf, and the element of farce and burlesque becomes more marked.<br>No doubt many of the later books, such as SUMMER LIGHTNING, are light<br>comedy rather than pure farce, but the occasional attempts at moral<br>earnestness which can be found in PSMITH, JOURNALIST; THE LITTLE NUGGET;<br>THE COMING OF BILL, THE MAN WITH TWO LEFT FEET and some of the school<br>stories, no longer appear. Mike Jackson has turned into Bertie Wooster.<br>That, however, is not a very startling metamorphosis, and one of the most<br>noticeable things about Wodehouse is his LACK of development. Books like<br>THE GOLD BAT and TALES OF ST AUSTIN'S, written in the opening years of<br>this century, already have the familiar atmosphere. How much of a formula<br>the writing of his later books had become one can see from the fact that<br>he continued to write stories of English life although throughout the<br>sixteen years before his internment he was living at Hollywood and Le<br>Touquet.<br><br>MIKE, which is now a difficult book to obtain in an unabridged form, must<br>be one of the best "light" school stories in English. But though its<br>incidents are largely farcical, it is by no means a satire on the<br>publicschool system, and THE GOLD BAT, THE POTHUNTERS, etc are even less<br>so. Wodehouse was educated at Dulwich, and then worked in a bank and<br>graduated into novel writing by way of very cheap journalism. It is clear<br>that for many years he remained "fixated" on his old school and loathed<br>the unromantic job and the lower-middle-class surroundings in which he<br>found himself. In the early stories the "glamour" of publicschool life<br>(house matches, fagging, teas round the study fire, etc) is laid on<br>fairly thick, and the "play the game" code of morals is accepted with not<br>many reservations. Wrykyn, Wodehouse's imaginary public school, is a<br>school of a more fashionable type than Dulwich, and one gets the<br>impression that between THE GOLD BAT (1904) and MIKE (1908) Wrykyn itself<br>has become more expensive and moved farther from London. Psychologically<br>the most revealing book of Wodehouse's early period is PSMITH IN THE<br>CITY. Mike Jackson's father has suddenly lost his money, and Mike, like<br>Wodehouse himself, is thrust at the age of about eighteen into an<br>ill-paid subordinate job in a bank. Psmith is similarly employed, though<br>not from financial necessity. Both this book and PSMITH, JOURNALIST<br>(1915) are unusual in that they display a certain amount of political<br>consciousness. Psmith at this stage chooses to call himself a<br>Socialist-in his mind, and no doubt in Wodehouse's, this means no more<br>than ignoring class distinctions-and on one occasion the two boys attend<br>an open-air meeting on Clapham Common and go home to tea with an elderly<br>Socialist orator, whose shabby-genteel home is described with some<br>accuracy. But the most striking feature of the book is Mike's inability<br>to wean himself from the atmosphere of school. He enters upon his job<br>without any pretence of enthusiasm, and his main desire is not, as one<br>might expect, to find a more interesting and useful job, but simply to be<br>playing cricket. When he has to find himself lodgings he chooses to<br>settle at Dulwich, because there he will be near a school and will be<br>able to hear the agreeable sound of the ball striking against the bat.<br>The climax of the book comes when Mike gets the chance to play in a<br>county match and simply walks out of his job in order to do so. The point<br>is that Wodehouse here sympathises with Mike: indeed he identified<br>himself with him, for it is clear enough that Mike bears the same<br>relation to Wodehouse as Julien Sorel to Stendhal. But he created many<br>other heroes essentially similar. Through the books of this and the next<br>period there passes a whole series of young men to whom playing games and<br>"keeping fit" are a sufficient life-work. Wodehouse is almost incapable of<br>imagining a desirable job. The great thing is to have money of your own,<br>or, failing that, to find a sinecure. The hero of SOMETHING FRESH (1915)<br>escapes from low-class journalism by becoming physical-training instructor<br>to a dyspeptic millionaire: this is regarded as a step up, morally as well<br>as financially.<br><br>In the books of the third period there is no narcissism and no serious<br>interludes, but the implied moral and social background has changed much<br>less than might appear at first sight. If one compares Bertie Wooster<br>with Mike, or even with the rugger-playing prefects of the earliest<br>school stories, one sees that the only real difference between them is<br>that Bertie is richer and lazier. His ideals would be almost the same as<br>theirs, but he fails to live up to them. Archie Moffam, in THE<br>INDISCRETIONS OF ARCHIE (1921), is a type intermediate between Bertie and<br>the earlier heroes: he is an ass, but he is also honest, kind-hearted,<br>athletic and courageous. From first to last Wodehouse takes the<br>public-school code of behaviour for granted, with the difference that in<br>his later, more sophisticated period he prefers to show his characters<br>violating it or living up to it against their will:<br><br><br>"Bertie! You wouldn't let down a pal?"<br>"Yes, 1 would."<br>"But we were at school together, Bertie."<br>"I don't care."<br>"The old school, Bertie, the old school!"<br>"Oh, well--dash it!"<br><br><br>Bertie, a sluggish Don Quixote, has no wish to tilt at windmills, but he<br>would hardly think of refusing to do so when honour calls. Most of the<br>people whom Wodehouse intends as sympathetic characters are parasites,<br>and some of them are plain imbeciles, but very few of them could be<br>described as immoral. Even Ukridge is a visionary rather than a plain<br>crook. The most immoral, or rather un-moral, of Wodehouse's characters is<br>Jeeves, who acts as a foil to Bertie Wooster's comparative<br>high-mindedness and perhaps symbolises the widespread English belief that<br>intelligence and unscrupulousness are much the same thing. How closely<br>Wodehouse sticks to conventional morality can be seen from the fact that<br>nowhere in his books is there anything in the nature of a sex joke. This is<br>an enormous sacrifice for a farcical writer to make. Not only are there no<br>dirty jokes, but there are hardly any compromising situations: the<br>horns-on-the-forehead motif is almost completely avoided. Most of the<br>full-length books, of course, contain a "love interest", but it is always<br>at the light-comedy level: the love affair, with its complications and<br>its idyllic scenes, goes on and on, but, as the saying goes "nothing<br>happens". It is significant that Wodehouse, by nature a writer of farces,<br>was able to collaborate more than once with lan Hay, a serio-comic writer<br>and an exponent (VIDE PIP, etc) of the "clean-living Englishman"<br>tradition at its silliest.<br><br>In SOMETHING FRESH Wodehouse had discovered the comic possibilities of<br>the English aristocracy, and a succession of ridiculous but, save in a<br>very few instances, not actually contemptible barons, earls and what-not<br>followed accordingly. This had the rather curious effect of causing<br>Wodehouse to be regarded, outside England, as a penetrating satirist of<br>English society. Hence Flannery's statement that Wodehouse "made fun of<br>the English," which is the impression he would probably make on a German<br>or even an American reader. Some time after the broadcasts from Berlin I<br>was discussing them with a young Indian Nationalist who defended<br>Wodehouse warmly. He took it for granted that Wodehouse HAD gone over to<br>the enemy, which from his own point of view was the right thing to do.<br>But what interested me was to find that he regarded Wodehouse as an<br>anti-British writer who had done useful work by showing up the British<br>aristocracy in their true colours. This is a mistake that it would be<br>very difficult for an English person to make, and is a good instance of<br>the way in which books, especially humorous books, lose their finer<br>nuances when they reach a foreign audience. For it is clear enough that<br>Wodehouse is not anti-British, and not anti-upper class either. On the<br>contrary, a harmless old-fashioned snobbishness is perceptible all<br>through his work. Just as an intelligent Catholic is able to see that the<br>blasphemies of Baudelaire or James Joyce are not seriously damaging to<br>the Catholic faith, so an English reader can see that in creating such<br>characters as Hildebrand Spencer Poyns de Burgh John Hanneyside<br>Coombe-Crombie, 12th Earl of Dreever, Wodehouse is not really attacking<br>the social hierarchy. Indeed, no one who genuinely despised titles would<br>write of them so much. Wodehouse's attitude towards the English social<br>system is the same as his attitude towards the public-school moral code —<br>a mild facetiousness covering an unthinking acceptance. The Earl of<br>Emsworth is funny because an earl ought to have more dignity, and Bertie<br>Wooster's helpless dependence on Jeeves is funny partly because the<br>servant ought not to be superior to the master. An American reader can<br>mistake these two, and others like them, for hostile caricatures, because<br>he is inclined to be Anglophobe already and they correspond to his<br>preconceived ideas about a decadent aristocracy. Bertie Wooster, with his<br>spats and his cane, is the traditional stage Englishman. But, as any<br>English reader would see, Wodehouse intends him as a sympathetic figure,<br>and Wodehouse's real sin has been to present the English upper classes as<br>much nicer people than they are. All through his books certain problems<br>are constantly avoided. Almost without exception his moneyed young men<br>are unassuming, good mixers, not avaricious: their tone is set for them<br>by Psmith, who retains his own upper-class exterior but bridges the<br>social gap by addressing everyone as "Comrade".<br><br>But there is another important point about Bertie Wooster: his<br>out-of-dateness. Conceived in 1917 or thereabouts, Bertie really belongs<br>to an epoch earlier than that. He is the "knut" of the pre-1914 period,<br>celebrated in such songs as "Gilbert the Filbert" or "Reckless Reggie of<br>the Regent's Palace". The kind of life that Wodehouse writes about by<br>preference, the life of the "clubman" or "man about town", the elegant<br>young man who lounges all the morning in Piccadilly with a cane under his<br>arm and a carnation in his buttonhole, barely survived into the<br>nineteen-twenties. It is significant that Wodehouse could publish in 1936<br>a book entitled YOUNG MEN IN SPATS. For who was wearing spats at that<br>date? They had gone out of fashion quite ten years earlier. But the<br>traditional "knut", the "Piccadilly Johnny", OUGHT to wear spats, just as<br>the pantomime Chinese ought to wear a pigtail. A humorous writer is not<br>obliged to keep up to date, and having struck one or two good veins,<br>Wodehouse continued to exploit them with a regularity that was no doubt<br>all the easier because he did not set foot in England during the sixteen<br>years that preceded his internment. His picture of English society had<br>been formed before 1914, and it was a naive, traditional and, at bottom,<br>admiring picture. Nor did he ever become genuinely americanised. As I<br>have pointed out, spontaneous Americanisms do occur in the books of the<br>middle period, but Wodehouse remained English enough to find American<br>slang an amusing and slightly shocking novelty. He loves to thrust a slang<br>phrase or a crude fact in among Wardour Street English ("With a hollow<br>groan Ukridge borrowed five shillings from me and went out into the<br>night"), and expressions like "a piece of cheese" or "bust him on the<br>noggin" lend themselves to this purpose. But the trick had been developed<br>before he made any American contacts, and his use of garbled quotations<br>is a common device of English writers running back to Fielding. As<br>Mr John Hayward has pointed out, [Note, below] Wodehouse owes a good deal<br>to his knowledge of English literature and especially of Shakespeare.<br>His books are aimed, not, obviously, at a highbrow audience, but at an<br>audience educated along traditional lines. When, for instance, he<br>describes somebody as heaving "the kind of sigh that Prometheus might<br>have heaved when the vulture dropped in for its lunch", he is assuming<br>that his readers will know something of Greek mythology. In his early<br>days the writers he admired were probably Barry Pain, Jerome K. Jerome,<br>W. W. Jacobs, Kipling and F. Anstey, and he has remained closer to them<br>than to the quickmoving American comic writers such as Ring Lardner<br>or Damon Runyon. In his radio interview with Flannery, Wodehouse wondered<br>whether "the kind of people and the kind of England I write about will<br>live after the war", not realising that they were ghosts already.<br>"He was still living in the period about which he wrote," says Flannery,<br>meaning, probably, the nineteen-twenties. But the period was really the<br>Edwardian age, and Bertie Wooster, if he ever existed, was killed round<br>about 1915.<br><br>[Note: "P. G. Wodehouse" by John Hayward. (The Saturday Book, 1942.)<br>I believe this is the only full-length critical essay on Wodehouse.<br>(Author's footnote.)]<br><br>If my analysis of Wodehouse's mentality is accepted, the idea that in<br>1941 he consciously aided the Nazi propaganda machine becomes untenable<br>and even ridiculous. He MAY have been induced to broadcast by the promise<br>of an earlier release (he was due for release a few months later, on<br>reaching his sixtieth birthday), but he cannot have realised that what he<br>did would be damaging to British interests. As I have tried to show, his<br>moral outlook has remained that of a public-school boy, and according to<br>the public-school code, treachery in time of war is the most unforgivable<br>of all the sins. But how could he fail to grasp that what he did would be<br>a big propaganda score for the Germans and would bring down a torrent of<br>disapproval on his own head? To answer this one must take two things into<br>consideration. First, Wodehouse's complete lack — so far as one can judge<br>from his printed works--of political awareness. It is nonsense to talk<br>of "Fascist tendencies" in his books. There are no post-1918 tendencies<br>at all. Throughout his work there is a certain uneasy awareness of the<br>problem of class distinctions, and scattered through it at various dates<br>there are ignorant though not unfriendly references to Socialism. In THE<br>HEART OF A GOOF (1926) there is a rather silly story about a Russian<br>novelist, which seems to have been inspired by the factional struggle<br>then raging in the U.S.S.R. But the references in it to the Soviet system<br>are entirely frivolous and, considering the date, not markedly hostile.<br>That is about the extent of Wodehouse's political consciousness, so far<br>as it is discoverable from his writings. Nowhere, so far as I know, does<br>he so much as use the word "Fascism" or "Nazism." In left-wing circles,<br>indeed in "enlightened" circles of any kind, to broadcast on the Nazi<br>radio, to have any truck with the Nazis whatever, would have seemed just<br>as shocking an action before the war as during it. But that is a habit of<br>mind that had been developed during nearly a decade of ideological<br>struggle against Fascism. The bulk of the British people, one ought to<br>remember, remained an¦sthetic to that struggle until late into 1940.<br>Abyssinia, Spain, China, Austria, Czechoslovakia — the long series of<br>crimes and aggressions had simply slid past their consciousness or were<br>dimly noted as quarrels occurring among foreigners and "not our<br>business." One can gauge the general ignorance from the fact that the<br>ordinary Englishman thought of "Fascism" as an exclusively Italian thing<br>and was bewildered when the same word was applied to Germany. And there<br>is nothing in Wodehouse's writings to suggest that he was better<br>informed, or more interested in politics, than the general run of his<br>readers.<br><br>The other thing one must remember is that Wodehouse happened to be taken<br>prisoner at just the moment when the war reached its desperate phase. We<br>forget these things now, but until that time feelings about the war had<br>been noticeably tepid. There was hardly any fighting, the Chamberlain<br>Government was unpopular, eminent publicists were hinting that we should<br>make a compromise peace as quickly as possible, trade union and Labour<br>Party branches all over the country were passing anti-war resolutions.<br>Afterwards, of course, things changed. The Army was with difficulty<br>extricated from Dunkirk, France collapsed, Britain was alone, the bombs<br>rained on London, Goebbels announced that Britain was to be "reduced to<br>degradation and poverty". By the middle of 1941 the British people knew<br>what they were up against and feelings against the enemy were far fiercer<br>than before. But Wodehouse had spent the intervening year in internment,<br>and his captors seem to have treated him reasonably well. He had missed<br>the turning-point of the war, and in 1941 he was still reacting in terms<br>of 1939. He was not alone in this. On several occasions about this time<br>the Germans brought captured British soldiers to the microphone, and some<br>of them made remarks at least as tactless as Wodehouse's. They attracted<br>no attention, however. And even an outright Quisling like John Amery was<br>afterwards to arouse much less indignation than Wodehouse had done.<br><br>But why? Why should a few rather silly but harmless remarks by an elderly<br>novelist have provoked such an outcry? One has to look for the probable<br>answer amid the dirty requirements of propaganda warfare.<br><br>There is one point about the Wodehouse broadcasts that is almost<br>certainly significant — the date. Wodehouse was released two or three<br>days before the invasion of the U.S.S.R., and at a time when the higher<br>ranks of the Nazi party must have known that the invasion was imminent.<br>It was vitally necessary to keep America out of the war as long as<br>possible, and in fact, about this time, the German attitude towards the<br>U.S.A. did become more conciliatory than it had been before. The Germans<br>could hardly hope to defeat Russia, Britain and the U.S.A. in<br>combination, but if they could polish off Russia quickly — and presumably<br>they expected to do so — the Americans might never intervene. The release<br>of Wodehouse was only a minor move, but it was not a bad sop to throw to<br>the American isolationists. He was well known in the United States, and<br>he was — or so the Germans calculated — popular with the Anglophobe<br>public as a caricaturist who made fun of the silly-ass Englishman with<br>his spats and his monocle. At the microphone he could be trusted to<br>damage British prestige in one way or another, while his release would<br>demonstrate that the Germans were good fellows and knew how to treat<br>their enemies chivalrously. That presumably was the calculation, though<br>the fact that Wodehouse was only broadcasting for about a week suggests<br>that he did not come up to expectations.<br><br>But on the British side similar though opposite calculations were at<br>work. For the two years following Dunkirk, British morale depended<br>largely upon the feeling that this was not only a war for democracy but a<br>war which the common people had to win by their own efforts. The upper<br>classes were discredited by their appeasement policy and by the disasters<br>of 1940, and a social levelling process appeared to be taking place.<br>Patriotism and left-wing sentiments were associated in the popular mind,<br>and numerous able journalists were at work to tie the association<br>tighter. Priestley's 1940 broadcasts, and "Cassandra's" articles in the<br>DAILY MIRROR, were good examples of the demagogic propaganda flourishing<br>at that time. In this atmosphere, Wodehouse made an ideal whipping-boy.<br>For it was generally felt that the rich were treacherous, and Wodehouse —<br>as "Cassandra" vigorously pointed out in his broadcast — was a rich man.<br>But he was the kind of rich man who could be attacked with impunity and<br>without risking any damage to the structure of society. To denounce<br>Wodehouse was not like denouncing, say, Beaverbrook. A mere novelist,<br>however large his earnings may happen to be, is not OF the possessing<br>class. Even if his income touches £50,000 a year he has only the outward<br>semblance of a millionaire. He is a lucky outsider who has fluked into a<br>fortune — usually a very temporary fortune — like the winner of the<br>Calcutta Derby Sweep. Consequently, Wodehouse's indiscretion gave a good<br>propaganda opening. It was a chance to "expose" a wealthy parasite<br>without drawing attention to any of the parasites who really mattered.<br><br>In the desperate circumstances of the time, it was excusable to be angry<br>at what Wodehouse did, but to go on denouncing him three or four years<br>later — and more, to let an impression remain that he acted with<br>conscious treachery — is not excusable. Few things in this war have been<br>more morally disgusting than the present hunt after traitors and<br>Quislings. At best it is largely the punishment of the guilty by the<br>guilty. In France, all kinds of petty rats — police officials,<br>penny-a-lining journalists, women who have slept with German soldiers —<br>are hunted down while almost without exception the big rats escape. In<br>England the fiercest tirades against Quislings are uttered by<br>Conservatives who were practising appeasement in 1938 and Communists who<br>were advocating it in 1940. I have striven to show how the wretched<br>Wodehouse — just because success and expatriation had allowed him to<br>remain mentally in the Edwardian age — became the CORPUS VILE in a<br>propaganda experiment, and I suggest that it is now time to regard the<br>incident as closed. If Ezra Pound is caught and shot by the American<br>authorities, it will have the effect of establishing his reputation as a<br>poet for hundreds of years; and even in the case of Wodehouse, if we<br>drive him to retire to the United States and renounce his British<br>citizenship, we shall end by being horribly ashamed of ourselves.<br>Meanwhile, if we really want to punish the people who weakened national<br>morale at critical moments, there are other culprits who are nearer home<br>and better worth chasing.<br><br></font></p>
