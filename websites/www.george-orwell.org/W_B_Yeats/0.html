<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">One thing that Marxist criticism has not succeeded in doing is to trace<br>the connection between "tendency" and literary style. The subject-matter<br>and imagery of a book can be explained in sociological terms, but its<br>texture seemingly cannot. Yet some such connection there must be. One<br>knows, for instance, that a Socialist would not write like Chesterton or<br>a Tory imperialist like Bernard Shaw, though HOW one knows it is not<br>easy to say. In the case of Yeats, there must be some kind of connection<br>between his wayward, even tortured style of writing and his rather<br>sinister vision of life. Mr Menon is chiefly concerned with the<br>esoteric philosophy underlying Yeats's work, but the quotations which<br>are scattered all through his interesting book serve to remind one how<br>artificial Yeats's manner of writing was. As a rule, this artificiality<br>is accepted as Irishism, or Yeats is even credited with simplicity<br>because he uses short words, but in fact one seldom comes on six<br>consecutive lines of his verse in which there is not an archaism or an<br>affected turn of speech. To take the nearest example:<br><br>Grant me an old man's Frenzy,<br>My self must I remake<br>Till I am Timon and Lear<br>Or that William Blake<br>Who beat upon the wall<br>Till Truth obeyed his call.<br><br>The unnecessary "that" imports a feeling of affectation, and the same<br>tendency is present in all but Yeats's best passages. One is seldom long<br>away from a suspicion of "quaintness", something that links up not only<br>with the 'nineties, the Ivory Tower and the "calf covers of pissed-on<br>green", but also with Rackham's drawings, Liberty art-fabrics and the<br>PETER PAN never-never land, of which, after all, "The Happy Townland" is<br>merely a more appetising example. This does not matter, because, on the<br>whole, Yeats gets away with it, and if his straining after effect is<br>often irritating, it can also produce phrases ("the chill, footless<br>years", "the mackerel-crowded seas") which suddenly overwhelm one like a<br>girl's face seen across a room. He is an exception to the rule that poets<br>do not use poetical language:<br><br>How many centuries spent<br>The sedentary soul<br>In toils of measurement<br>Beyond eagle or mole,<br>Beyond hearing or seeing,<br>Or Archimedes' guess,<br>To raise into being<br>That loveliness?<br><br>Here he does not flinch from a squashy vulgar word like "loveliness" and<br>after all it does not seriously spoil this wonderful passage. But the<br>same tendencies, together with a sort of raggedness which is no doubt<br>intentional, weaken his epigrams and polemical poems. For instance (I am<br>quoting from memory) the epigram against the critics who damned THE<br>PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN WORLD:<br><br>Once when midnight smote the air<br>Eunuchs ran through Hell and met<br>On every crowded street to stare<br>Upon great Juan riding by;<br>Even like these to rail and sweat,<br>Staring upon his sinewy thigh.<br><br>The power which Yeats has within himself gives him the analogy ready<br>made and produces the tremendous scorn of the last line, but even in<br>this short poem there are six or seven unnecessary words. It would<br>probably have been deadlier if it had been neater.<br><br>Mr Menon's book is incidentally a short biography of Yeats, but he is<br>above all interested in Yeats's philosophical "system", which in his<br>opinion supplies the subject-matter of more of Yeats's poems than is<br>generally recognised. This system is set forth fragmentarily in various<br>places, and at full length in A VISION, a privately printed book which I<br>have never read but which Mr Menon quotes from extensively. Yeats gave<br>conflicting accounts of its origin, and Mr Menon hints pretty broadly<br>that the "documents" on which it was ostensibly founded were imaginary.<br>Yeats's philosophical system, says Mr Menon, "was at the back of his<br>intellectual life almost from the beginning. His poetry is full of it.<br>Without it his later poetry becomes almost completely unintelligible."<br>As soon as we begin to read about the so-called system we are in the<br>middle of a hocus-pocus of Great Wheels, gyres, cycles of the moon,<br>reincarnation, disembodied spirits, astrology and what not. Yeats hedges<br>as to the literalness with which he believed in all this, but he certainly<br>dabbled in spiritualism and astrology, and in earlier life had made<br>experiments in alchemy. Although almost buried under explanations, very<br>difficult to understand, about the phases of the moon, the central idea of<br>his philosophical system seems to be our old friend, the cyclical<br>universe, in which everything happens over and over again. One has not,<br>perhaps, the right to laugh at Yeats for his mystical beliefs--for I<br>believe it could be shown that SOME degree of belief in magic is almost<br>universal--but neither ought one to write such things off as mere<br>unimportant eccentricities. It is Mr Menon's perception of this that<br>gives his book its deepest interest. "In the first flush of admiration<br>and enthusiasm," he says, "most people dismissed the fantastical<br>philosophy as the price we have to pay for a great and curious<br>intellect. One did not quite realise where he was heading. And those who<br>did, like Pound and perhaps Eliot, approved the stand that he finally<br>took. The first reaction to this did not come, as one might have<br>expected, from the politically-minded young English poets. They were<br>puzzled because a less rigid or artificial system than that of A VISION<br>might not have produced the great poetry of Yeats's last days." It might<br>not, and yet Yeats's philosophy has some very sinister implications, as<br>Mr Menon points out.<br><br>Translated into political terms, Yeats's tendency is Fascist. Throughout<br>most of his life, and long before Fascism was ever heard of, he had had<br>the outlook of those who reach Fascism by the aristocratic route. He is<br>a great hater of democracy, of the modern world, science, machinery, the<br>concept of progress--above all, of the idea of human equality. Much of<br>the imagery of his work is feudal, and it is clear that he was not<br>altogether free from ordinary snobbishness. Later these tendencies took<br>clearer shape and led him to "the exultant acceptance of authoritarianism<br>as the only solution. Even violence and tyranny are not necessarily<br>evil because the people, knowing not evil and good, would become<br>perfectly acquiescent to tyranny. . . . Everything must come from<br>the top. Nothing can come from the masses." Not much interested in<br>politics, and no doubt disgusted by his brief incursions into public<br>life, Yeats nevertheless makes political pronouncements. He is too big a<br>man to share the illusions of Liberalism, and as early as 1920 he<br>foretells in a justly famous passage ("The Second Coming") the kind of<br>world that we have actually moved into. But he appears to welcome the<br>coming age, which is to be "hierarchical, masculine, harsh, surgical",<br>and is influenced both by Ezra Pound and by various Italian Fascist<br>writers. He describes the new civilisation which he hopes and believes<br>will arrive: "an aristocratic civilisation in its most completed form,<br>every detail of life hierarchical, every great man's door crowded at<br>dawn by petitioners, great wealth everywhere in a few men's hands, all<br>dependent upon a few, up to the Emperor himself, who is a God dependent<br>on a greater God, and everywhere, in Court, in the family, an inequality<br>made law." The innocence of this statement is as interesting as its<br>snobbishness. To begin with, in a single phrase, "great wealth in a few<br>men's hands", Yeats lays bare the central reality of Fascism, which the<br>whole of its propaganda is designed to cover up. The merely political<br>Fascist claims always to be fighting for justice: Yeats, the poet, sees<br>at a glance that Fascism means injustice, and acclaims it for that very<br>reason. But at the same time he fails to see that the new authoritarian<br>civilisation, if it arrives, will not be aristocratic, or what he means<br>by aristocratic. It will not be ruled by noblemen with Van Dyck faces,<br>but by anonymous millionaires, shiny-bottomed bureaucrats and murdering<br>gangsters. Others who have made the same mistake have afterwards changed<br>their views and one ought not to assume that Yeats, if he had lived<br>longer, would necessarily have followed his friend Pound, even in<br>sympathy. But the tendency of the passage I have quoted above is<br>obvious, and its complete throwing overboard of whatever good the past<br>two thousand years have achieved is a disquieting symptom.<br><br>How do Yeat's political ideas link up with his leaning towards<br>occultism? It is not clear at first glance why hatred of democracy and a<br>tendency to believe in crystal-gazing should go together. Mr Menon only<br>discusses this rather shortly, but it is possible to make two guesses.<br>To begin with, the theory that civilisation moves in recurring cycles is<br>one way out for people who hate the concept of human equality. If it is<br>true that "all this", or something like it, "has happened before", then<br>science and the modern world are debunked at one stroke and progress<br>becomes for ever impossible. It does not much matter if the lower orders<br>are getting above themselves, for, after all, we shall soon be returning<br>to an age of tyranny. Yeats is by no means alone in this outlook. If the<br>universe is moving round on a wheel, the future must be foreseeable,<br>perhaps even in some detail. It is merely a question of discovering the<br>laws of its motion, as the early astronomers discovered the solar year.<br>Believe that, and it becomes difficult not to believe in astrology or<br>some similar system. A year before the war, examining a copy of<br>GRINGOIRE, the French Fascist weekly, much read by army officers, I<br>found in it no less than thirty-eight advertisements of clairvoyants.<br>Secondly, the very concept of occultism carries with it the idea that<br>knowledge must be a secret thing, limited to a small circle of<br>initiates. But the same idea is integral to Fascism. Those who dread the<br>prospect of universal suffrage, popular education, freedom of thought,<br>emancipation of women, will start off with a predilection towards secret<br>cults. There is another link between Fascism and magic in the profound<br>hostility of both to the Christian ethical code.<br><br>No doubt Yeats wavered in his beliefs and held at different times many<br>different opinions, some enlightened, some not. Mr Menon repeats for him<br>Eliot's claim that he had the longest period of development of any poet<br>who has ever lived. But there is one thing that seems constant, at least<br>in all of his work that I can remember, and that is his hatred of modern<br>western civilisation and desire to return to the Bronze Age, or perhaps<br>to the Middle Ages. Like all such thinkers, he tends to write in praise<br>of ignorance. The Fool in his remarkable play, THE HOUR-GLASS, is a<br>Chestertonian figure, "God's fool", the "natural born innocent", who is<br>always wiser than the wise man. The philosopher in the play dies on the<br>knowledge that all his lifetime of thought has been wasted (I am quoting<br>from memory again):<br><br>The stream of the world has changed its course,<br>And with the stream my thoughts have run<br>Into some cloudly, thunderous spring<br>That is its mountain-source;<br>Ay, to a frenzy of the mind,<br>That all that we have done's undone<br>Our speculation but as the wind.<br><br>Beautiful words, but by implication profoundly obscurantist and<br>reactionary; for if it is really true that a village idiot, as such, is<br>wiser than a philosopher, then it would be better if the alphabet had<br>never been invented. Of course, all praise of the past is partly<br>sentimental, because we do not live in the past. The poor do not praise<br>poverty. Before you can despise the machine, the machine must set you free<br>from brute labour. But that is not to say that Yeats's yearning for a more<br>primitive and more hierarchical age was not sincere. How much of all<br>this is traceable to mere snobbishness, product of Yeats's own position<br>as an impoverished offshoot of the aristocracy, is a different question.<br>And the connection between his obscurantist opinions and his tendency<br>towards "quaintness" of language remains to be worked out; Mr Menon<br>hardly touches upon it.<br><br>This is a very short book, and I would greatly like to see Mr Menon go<br>ahead and write another book on Yeats, starting where this one leaves<br>off. "If the greatest poet of our times is exultantly ringing in an era<br>of Fascism, it seems a somewhat disturbing symptom," he says on the last<br>page, and leaves it at that. It is a disturbing symptom, because it is<br>not an isolated one. By and large the best writers of our time have been<br>reactionary in tendency, and though Fascism does not offer any real<br>return to the past, those who yearn for the past will accept Fascism<br>sooner than its probable alternatives. But there are other lines of<br>approach, as we have seen during the past two or three years. The<br>relationship between Fascism and the literary intelligentsia badly needs<br>investigating, and Yeats might well be the starting-point. He is best<br>studied by someone like Mr Menon, who can approach a poet primarily as a<br>poet, but who also knows that a writer's political and religious beliefs<br>are not excrescences to be laughed away, but something that will leave<br>their mark even on the smallest detail of his work.<br><br></font></p>
