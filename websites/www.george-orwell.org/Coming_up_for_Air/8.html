<h2>Part 2, Chapter 5</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Fishing!<br><br>Here I'll make a confession, or rather two. The first is that when<br>I look back through my life I can't honestly say that anything I've<br>ever done has given me quite such a kick as fishing. Everything<br>else has been a bit of a flop in comparison, even women. I don't<br>set up to be one of those men that don't care about women. I've<br>spent plenty of time chasing them, and I would even now if I had<br>the chance. Still, if you gave me the choice of having any woman<br>you care to name, but I mean ANY woman, or catching a ten-pound<br>carp, the carp would win every time. And the other confession is<br>that after I was sixteen I never fished again.<br><br>Why? Because that's how things happen. Because in this life we<br>lead--I don't mean human life in general, I mean life in this<br>particular age and this particular country--we don't do the things<br>we want to do. It isn't because we're always working. Even a<br>farm-hand or a Jew tailor isn't always working. It's because<br>there's some devil in us that drives us to and fro on everlasting<br>idiocies. There's time for everything except the things worth<br>doing. Think of something you really care about. Then add hour to<br>hour and calculate the fraction of your life that you've actually<br>spent in doing it. And then calculate the time you've spent on<br>things like shaving, riding to and fro on buses, waiting in<br>railway, junctions, swapping dirty stories, and reading the<br>newspapers.<br><br>After I was sixteen I didn't go fishing again. There never seemed<br>to be time. I was at work, I was chasing girls, I was wearing my<br>first button boots and my first high collars (and for the collars<br>of 1909 you needed a neck like a giraffe), I was doing correspondence<br>courses in salesmanship and accountancy and 'improving my mind'.<br>The great fish were gliding round in the pool behind Binfield House.<br>Nobody knew about them except me. They were stored away in my mind;<br>some day, some bank holiday perhaps, I'd go back and catch them.<br>But I never went back. There was time for everything except that.<br>Curiously enough, the only time between then and now when I did very<br>nearly go fishing was during the war.<br><br>It was in the autumn of 1916, just before I was wounded. We'd come<br>out of trenches to a village behind the line, and though it was<br>only September we were covered with mud from head to foot. As<br>usual we didn't know for certain how long we were going to stay<br>there or where we were going afterwards. Luckily the C.O. was a<br>bit off-colour, a touch of bronchitis or something, and so didn't<br>bother about driving us through the usual parades, kit-inspections,<br>football matches, and so forth which were supposed to keep up the<br>spirits of the troops when they were out of the line. We spent the<br>first day sprawling about on piles of chaff in the barns where we<br>were billeted and scraping the mud off our putties, and in the<br>evening some of the chaps started queueing up for a couple of<br>wretched worn-out whores who were established in a house at the end<br>of the village. In the morning, although it was against orders to<br>leave the village, I managed to sneak off and wander round the<br>ghastly desolation that had once been fields. It was a damp,<br>wintry kind of morning. All round, of course, were the awful muck<br>and litter of war, the sort of filthy sordid mess that's actually<br>worse than a battlefield of corpses. Trees with boughs torn off<br>them, old shell-holes that had partly filled up again, tin cans,<br>turds, mud, weeds, clumps of rusty barbed wire with weeds growing<br>through them. You know the feeling you had when you came out of<br>the line. A stiffened feeling in all your joints, and inside you<br>a kind of emptiness, a feeling that you'd never again have any<br>interest in anything. It was partly fear and exhaustion but mainly<br>boredom. At that time no one saw any reason why the war shouldn't<br>go on for ever. Today or tomorrow or the day after you were going<br>back to the line, and maybe next week a shell would blow you to<br>potted meat, but that wasn't so bad as the ghastly boredom of the<br>war stretching out for ever.<br><br>I was wandering up the side of a hedge when I ran into a chap in<br>our company whose surname I don't remember but who was nicknamed<br>Nobby. He was a dark, slouching, gypsy-looking chap, a chap who<br>even in uniform always gave the impression that he was carrying a<br>couple of stolen rabbits. By trade he was a coster and he was a<br>real Cockney, but one of those Cockneys that make part of their<br>living by hop-picking, bird-catching, poaching, and fruit-stealing<br>in Kent and Essex. He was a great expert on dogs, ferrets, cage-<br>birds, fighting-cocks, and that kind of thing. As soon as he saw<br>me he beckoned to me with his head. He had a sly, vicious way of<br>talking:<br><br>''Ere, George!' (The chaps still called me George--I hadn't got<br>fat in those days.) 'George! Ja see that clump of poplars acrost<br>the field?'<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>'Well, there's a pool on t'other side of it, and it's full of<br>bleeding great fish.'<br><br>'Fish? Garn!'<br><br>'I tell you it's bleeding full of 'em. Perch, they are. As good<br>fish as ever I got my thumbs on. Com'n see f'yerself, then.'<br><br>We trudged over the mud together. Sure enough, Nobby was right.<br>On the other side of the poplars there was a dirty-looking pool<br>with sandy banks. Obviously it had been a quarry and had got<br>filled up with water. And it was swarming with perch. You could<br>see their dark blue stripy backs gliding everywhere just under<br>water, and some of them must have weighed a pound. I suppose in<br>two years of war they hadn't been disturbed and had had time to<br>multiply. Probably you can't imagine what the sight of those perch<br>had done to me. It was as though they'd suddenly brought me to<br>life. Of course there was only one thought in both our minds--how<br>to get hold of a rod and line.<br><br>'Christ!' I said. 'We'll have some of those.'<br><br>'You bet we f-- well will. C'mon back to the village and let's get<br>'old of some tackle.'<br><br>'O.K. You want to watch out, though. If the sergeant gets to know<br>we'll cop it.'<br><br>'Oh, f-- the sergeant. They can 'ang, drore, and quarter me if<br>they want to. I'm going to 'ave some of them bleeding fish.'<br><br>You can't know how wild we were to catch those fish. Or perhaps<br>you can, if you've ever been at war. You know the frantic boredom<br>of war and the way you'll clutch at almost any kind of amusement.<br>I've seen two chaps in a dugout fight like devils over half a<br>threepenny magazine. But there was more to it than that. It was<br>the thought of escaping, for perhaps a whole day, right out of the<br>atmosphere of war. To be sitting under the poplar trees, fishing<br>for perch, away from the Company, away from the noise and the stink<br>and the uniforms and the officers and the saluting and the<br>sergeant's voice! Fishing is the opposite of war. But it wasn't<br>at all certain that we could bring it off. That was the thought<br>that sent us into a kind of fever. If the sergeant found out he'd<br>stop us as sure as fate, and so would any of the officers, and the<br>worst of all was that there was no knowing how long we were going<br>to stay at the village. We might stay there a week, we might march<br>off in two hours. Meanwhile we'd no fishing tackle of any kind,<br>not even a pin or a bit of string. We had to start from scratch.<br>And the pool was swarming with fish! The first thing was a rod.<br>A willow wand is best, but of course there wasn't a willow tree<br>anywhere this side of the horizon. Nobby shinned up one of the<br>poplars and cut off a small bough which wasn't actually good but<br>was better than nothing. He trimmed it down with his jack-knife<br>till it looked something like a fishing-rod, and then we hid it in<br>the weeds near the bank and managed to sneak back into the village<br>without being seen.<br><br>The next thing was a needle to make a hook. Nobody had a needle.<br>One chap had some darning needles, but they were too thick and had<br>blunt ends. We daren't let anyone know what we wanted it for, for<br>fear the sergeant should hear about it. At last we thought of the<br>whores at the end of the village. They were pretty sure to have a<br>needle. When we got there--you had to go round to the back door<br>through a mucky courtyard--the house was shut up and the whores<br>were having a sleep which they'd no doubt earned. We stamped and<br>yelled and banged on the door until after about ten minutes a fat<br>ugly woman in a wrapper came down and screamed at us in French.<br>Nobby shouted at her:<br><br>'Needle! Needle! You got a needle!'<br><br>Of course she didn't know what he was talking about. Then Nobby<br>tried pidgin English, which he expected her as a foreigner to<br>understand:<br><br>'Wantee needle! Sewee clothee! Likee thisee!'<br><br>He made gestures which were supposed to represent sewing. The<br>whore misunderstood him and opened the door a bit wider to let us<br>in. Finally we made her understand and got a needle from her.<br>By this time it was dinner time.<br><br>After dinner the sergeant came round the barn where we were<br>billeted looking for men for a fatigue. We managed to dodge him<br>just in time by getting under a pile of chaff. When he was gone we<br>got a candle alight, made the needle red-hot, and managed to bend<br>it into a kind of hook. We didn't have any tools except jack-<br>knives, and we burned our fingers badly. The next thing was a<br>line. Nobody had any string except thick stuff, but at last we<br>came across a fellow who had a reel of sewing thread. He didn't<br>want to part with it and we had to give him a whole packet of fags<br>for it. The thread was much too thin, but Nobby cut it into three<br>lengths, tied them to a nail in the wall, and carefully plaited<br>them. Meanwhile after searching all over the village I'd managed<br>to find a cork, and I cut it in half and stuck a match through it<br>to make afloat. By this time it was evening and getting on towards<br>dark.<br><br>We'd got the essentials now, but we could do with some gut. There<br>didn't seem much hope of getting any until we thought of the<br>hospital orderly. Surgical gut wasn't part of his equipment, but<br>it was just possible that he might have some. Sure enough, when we<br>asked him, we found he'd a whole hank of medical gut in his<br>haversack. It had taken his fancy in some hospital or other and<br>he'd pinched it. We swapped another packet of fags for ten lengths<br>of gut. It was rotten brittle stuff, in pieces about six inches<br>long. After dark Nobby soaked them till they were pliable and tied<br>them end to end. So now we'd got everything--hook, rod, line,<br>float, and gut. We could dig up worms anywhere. And the pool was<br>swarming with fish! Huge great stripy perch crying out to be<br>caught! We lay down to kip in such a fever that we didn't even<br>take our boots off. Tomorrow! If we could just have tomorrow! If<br>the war would forget about us for just a day! We made up our minds<br>that as soon as roll-call was over we'd hook it and stay away all<br>day, even if they gave us Field Punishment No. 1 for it when we<br>came back.<br><br>Well, I expect you can guess the rest. At roll-call orders were to<br>pack all kits and be ready to march in twenty minutes. We marched<br>nine miles down the road and then got on to lorries and were off to<br>another part of the line. As for the pool under the poplar trees,<br>I never saw or heard of it again. I expect it got poisoned with<br>mustard gas later on.<br><br>Since then I've never fished. I never seemed to get the chance.<br>There was the rest of the war, and then like everyone else I was<br>fighting for a job, and then I'd got a job and the job had got me.<br>I was a promising young fellow in an insurance office--one of those<br>keen young businessmen with firm jaws and good prospects that you<br>used to read about in the Clark's College adverts--and then I was<br>the usual down-trodden five-to-ten-pounds-a-weeker in a semidetached<br>villa in the inner-outer suburbs. Such people don't go fishing, any<br>more than stockbrokers go out picking primroses. It wouldn't be<br>suitable. Other recreations are provided for them.<br><br>Of course I have my fortnight's holiday every summer. You know<br>the kind of holiday. Margate, Yarmouth, Eastbourne, Hastings,<br>Bournemouth, Brighton. There's a slight variation according to<br>whether or not we're flush that year. With a woman like Hilda<br>along, the chief feature of a holiday is endless mental arithmetic<br>to decide how much the boarding-house keeper is swindling you.<br>That and telling the kids, No, they can't have a new sandbucket.<br>A few years back we were at Bournemouth. One fine afternoon we<br>loitered down the pier, which must be about half a mile long, and<br>all the way along it chaps were fishing with stumpy sea-rods with<br>little bells on the end and their lines stretching fifty yards out<br>to sea. It's a dull kind of fishing, and they weren't catching<br>anything. Still, they were fishing. The kids soon got bored and<br>clamoured to go back to the beach, and Hilda saw a chap sticking a<br>lobworm on his hook and said it made her feel sick, but I kept<br>loitering up and down for a little while longer. And suddenly<br>there was a tremendous ringing from a bell and a chap was winding<br>in his line. Everyone stopped to watch. And sure enough, in it<br>came, the wet line and the lump of lead and on the end a great<br>flat-fish (a flounder, I think) dangling and wriggling. The chap<br>dumped it on to the planks of the pier, and it flapped up and down,<br>all wet and gleaming, with its grey warty back and its white belly<br>and the fresh salty smell of the sea. And something kind of moved<br>inside me.<br><br>As we moved off I said casually, just to test Hilda's reaction:<br><br>'I've half a mind to do a bit of fishing myself while we're here.'<br><br>'What! YOU go fishing, George? But you don't even know how, do<br>you?'<br><br>'Oh, I used to be a great fisherman,' I told her.<br><br>She was vaguely against it, as usual, but didn't have many ideas<br>one way or the other, except that if I went fishing she wasn't<br>coming with me to watch me put those nasty squashy things on the<br>hook. Then suddenly she got on to the fact that if I was to go<br>fishing the set-out-that I'd need, rod and reel and so forth, would<br>cost round about a quid. The rod alone would cost ten bob.<br>Instantly she flew into a temper. You haven't seen old Hilda when<br>there's talk of wasting ten bob. She burst out at me:<br><br>'The IDEA of wasting all that money on a thing like that! Absurd!<br>And how they DARE charge ten shillings for one of those silly<br>little fishing-rods! It's disgraceful. And fancy you going<br>fishing at your age! A great big grown-up man like you. Don't be<br>such a BABY, George.'<br><br>Then the kids got on to it. Lorna sidled up to me and asked in<br>that silly pert way she has, 'Are you a baby, Daddy?' and little<br>Billy, who at that time didn't speak quite plain, announced to the<br>world in general, 'Farver's a baby.' Then suddenly they were both<br>dancing round me, rattling their sandbuckets and chanting:<br><br>'Farver's a baby! Farver's a baby!'<br><br>Unnatural little bastards! <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/7.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/9.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
