<h2>Part 3, Chapter 3</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">It was June the seventeenth, Friday, the second day of the coarse-<br>fishing season.<br><br>I hadn't had any difficulty in fixing things with the firm. As for<br>Hilda, I'd fitted her up with a story that was all shipshape and<br>watertight. I'd fixed on Birmingham for my alibi, and at the last<br>moment I'd even told her the name of the hotel I was going to stay<br>at, Rowbottom's Family and Commercial. I happened to know the<br>address because I'd stayed there some years earlier. At the same<br>time I didn't want her writing to me at Birmingham, which she might<br>do if I was away as long as a week. After thinking it over I took<br>young Saunders, who travels for Glisso Floor Polish, partly into my<br>confidence. He'd happened to mention that he'd be passing through<br>Birmingham on the eighteenth of June, and I got him to promise that<br>he'd stop on his way and post a letter from me to Hilda, addressed<br>from Rowbottom's. This was to tell her that I might be called away<br>and she'd better not write. Saunders understood, or thought he<br>did. He gave me a wink and said I was wonderful for my age. So<br>that settled Hilda. She hadn't asked any questions, and even if<br>she turned suspicious later, an alibi like that would take some<br>breaking.<br><br>I drove through Westerham. It was a wonderful June morning. A<br>faint breeze blowing, and the elm tops swaying in the sun, little<br>white clouds streaming across the sky like a flock of sheep, and<br>the shadows chasing each other across the fields. Outside<br>Westerham a Walls' Ice Cream lad, with cheeks like apples, came<br>tearing towards me on his bike, whistling so that it went through<br>your head. It suddenly reminded me of the time when I'd been an<br>errand boy myself (though in those days we didn't have free-wheel<br>bikes) and I very nearly stopped him and took one. They'd cut the<br>hay in places, but they hadn't got it in yet. It lay drying in<br>long shiny rows, and the smell of it drifted across the road and<br>got mixed up with the petrol.<br><br>I drove along at a gentle fifteen. The morning had a kind of<br>peaceful, dreamy feeling. The ducks floated about on the ponds as<br>if they felt too satisfied to eat. In Nettlefield, the village<br>beyond Westerham, a little man in a white apron, with grey hair and<br>a huge grey moustache, darted across the green, planted himself in<br>the middle of the road and began doing physical jerks to attract my<br>attention. My car's known all along this road, of course. I<br>pulled up. It's only Mr Weaver, who keeps the village general<br>shop. No, he doesn't want to insure his life, nor his shop either.<br>He's merely run out of change and wants to know whether I've got a<br>quid's worth of 'large silver'. They never have any change in<br>Nettlefield, not even at the pub.<br><br>I drove on. The wheat would have been as tall as your waist. It<br>went undulating up and down the hills like a great green carpet,<br>with the wind rippling it a little, kind of thick and silky-<br>looking. It's like a woman, I thought. It makes you want to lie<br>on it. And a bit ahead of me I saw the sign-post where the road<br>forks right for Pudley and left for Oxford.<br><br>I was still on my usual beat, inside the boundary of my own<br>'district', as the firm calls it. The natural thing, as I was<br>going westward, would have been to leave London along the Uxbridge<br>Road. But by a kind of instinct I'd followed my usual route. The<br>fact was I was feeling guilty about the whole business. I wanted<br>to get well away before I headed for Oxfordshire. And in spite of<br>the fact that I'd fixed things so neatly with Hilda and the firm,<br>in spite of the twelve quid in my pocket-book and the suitcase in<br>the back of the car, as I got nearer the crossroads I actually felt<br>a temptation--I knew I wasn't going to succumb to it, and yet it<br>was a temptation--to chuck the whole thing up. I had a sort of<br>feeling that so long as I was driving along my normal beat I was<br>still inside the law. It's not too late, I thought. There's still<br>time to do the respectable thing. I could run into Pudley, for<br>instance, see the manager of Barclay's Bank (he's our agent at<br>Pudley) and find out if any new business had come in. For that<br>matter I could even turn round, go back to Hilda, and make a clean<br>breast of the plot.<br><br>I slowed down as I got to the corner. Should I or shouldn't I?<br>For about a second I was really tempted. But no! I tooted the<br>klaxon and swung the car westward, on to the Oxford road.<br><br>Well, I'd done it. I was on the forbidden ground. It was true<br>that five miles farther on, if I wanted to, I could turn to the<br>left again and get back to Westerham. But for the moment I was<br>headed westward. Strictly speaking I was in flight. And what was<br>curious, I was no sooner on the Oxford road than I felt perfectly<br>certain that THEY knew all about it. When I say THEY I mean all<br>the people who wouldn't approve of a trip of this kind and who'd<br>have stopped me if they could--which, I suppose, would include<br>pretty well everybody.<br><br>What was more, I actually had a feeling that they were after me<br>already. The whole lot of them! All the people who couldn't<br>understand why a middle-aged man with false teeth should sneak away<br>for a quiet week in the place where he spent his boyhood. And all<br>the mean-minded bastards who COULD understand only too well, and<br>who'd raise heaven and earth to prevent it. They were all on my<br>track. It was as if a huge army were streaming up the road behind<br>me. I seemed to see them in my mind's eye. Hilda was in front, of<br>course, with the kids tagging after her, and Mrs Wheeler driving<br>her forward with a grim, vindictive expression, and Miss Minns<br>rushing along in the rear, with her pince-nez slipping down and a<br>look of distress on her face, like the hen that gets left behind<br>when the others have got hold of the bacon rind. And Sir Herbert<br>Crum and the higher-ups of the Flying Salamander in their Rolls-<br>Royces and Hispano-Suizas. And all the chaps at the office, and<br>all the poor down-trodden pen-pushers from Ellesmere Road and from<br>all such other roads, some of them wheeling prams and mowing-<br>machines and concrete garden-rollers, some of them chugging along<br>in little Austin Sevens. And all the soul-savers and Nosey<br>Parkers, the people whom you've never seen but who rule your<br>destiny all the same, the Home Secretary, Scotland Yard, the<br>Temperance League, the Bank of England, Lord Beaverbrook, Hitler<br>and Stalin on a tandem bicycle, the bench of Bishops, Mussolini,<br>the Pope--they were all of them after me. I could almost hear them<br>shouting:<br><br>'There's a chap who thinks he's going to escape! There's a chap<br>who says he won't be streamlined! He's going back to Lower<br>Binfield! After him! Stop him!'<br><br>It's queer. The impression was so strong that I actually took a<br>peep through the little window at the back of the car to make sure<br>I wasn't being followed. Guilty conscience, I suppose. But there<br>was nobody. Only the dusty white road and the long line of the<br>elms dwindling out behind me.<br><br>I trod on the gas and the old car rattled into the thirties. A few<br>minutes later I was past the Westerham turning. So that was that.<br>I'd burnt my boats. This was the idea which, in a dim sort of way,<br>had begun to form itself in my mind the day I got my new false<br>teeth. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/15.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/17.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
