<h2>Part 4, Chapter 5</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">But I had to see the pool at Binfield House.<br><br>I felt really bad that morning. The fact was that ever since I<br>struck Lower Binfield I'd been drinking almost continuously from<br>every opening time to every closing time. The reason, though it<br>hadn't occurred to me till this minute, was that really there'd<br>been nothing else to do. That was all my trip had amounted to so<br>far--three days on the booze.<br><br>The same as the other morning, I crawled over to the window and<br>watched the bowler hats and school caps hustling to and fro. My<br>enemies, I thought. The conquering army that's sacked the town and<br>covered the ruins with fag-ends and paper bags. I wondered why I<br>cared. You think, I dare say, that if it had given me a jolt to<br>find Lower Binfield swollen into a kind of Dagenham, it was merely<br>because I don't like to see the earth getting fuller and country<br>turning into town. But it isn't that at all. I don't mind towns<br>growing, so long as they do grow and don't merely spread like gravy<br>over a tablecloth. I know that people have got to have somewhere<br>to live, and that if a factory isn't in one place it'll be in<br>another. As for the picturesqueness, the sham countrified stuff,<br>the oak panels and pewter dishes and copper warming-pans and what-<br>not, it merely gives me the sick. Whatever we were in the old<br>days, we weren't picturesque. Mother would never have seen any<br>sense in the antiques that Wendy had filled our house with. She<br>didn't like gateleg tables--she said they 'caught your legs'. As<br>for pewter, she wouldn't have it in the house. 'Nasty greasy<br>stuff', she called it. And yet, say what you like, there was<br>something that we had in those days and haven't got now, something<br>that you probably can't have in a streamlined milk-bar with the<br>radio playing. I'd come back to look for it, and I hadn't found<br>it. And yet somehow I half believe in it even now, when I hadn't<br>yet got my teeth in and my belly was crying out for an aspirin and<br>a cup of tea.<br><br>And that started me thinking again about the pool at Binfield<br>House. After seeing what they'd done to the town, I'd had a<br>feeling you could only describe as fear about going to see whether<br>the pool still existed. And yet it might, there was no knowing.<br>The town was smothered under red brick, our house was full of Wendy<br>and her junk, the Thames was poisoned with motor-oil and paper<br>bags. But maybe the pool was still there, with the great black<br>fish still cruising round it. Maybe, even, it was still hidden in<br>the woods and from that day to this no one had discovered it<br>existed. It was quite possible. It was a very thick bit of wood,<br>full of brambles and rotten brushwood (the beech trees gave way to<br>oaks round about there, which made the undergrowth thicker), the<br>kind of place most people don't care to penetrate. Queerer things<br>have happened.<br><br>I didn't start out till late afternoon. It must have been about<br>half past four when I took the car out and drove on to the Upper<br>Binfield road. Half-way up the hill the houses thinned out and<br>stopped and the beech trees began. The road forks about there and<br>I took the right-hand fork, meaning to make a detour round and come<br>back to Binfield House on the road. But presently I stopped to<br>have a look at the copse I was driving through. The beech trees<br>seemed just the same. Lord, how they were the same! I backed the<br>car on to a bit of grass beside the road, under a fall of chalk,<br>and got out and walked. Just the same. The same stillness, the<br>same great beds of rustling leaves that seem to go on from year to<br>year without rotting. Not a creature stirring except the small<br>birds in the tree-tops which you couldn't see. It wasn't easy to<br>believe that that great noisy mess of a town was barely three miles<br>away. I began to make my way through the little copse, in the<br>direction of Binfield House. I could vaguely remember how the<br>paths went. And Lord! Yes! The same chalk hollow where the Black<br>Hand went and had catapult shots, and Sid Lovegrove told us how<br>babies were born, the day I caught my first fish, pretty near forty<br>years ago!<br><br>As the trees thinned out again you could see the other road and the<br>wall of Binfield House. The old rotting wooden fence was gone, of<br>course, and they'd put up a high brick wall with spikes on top,<br>such as you'd expect to see round a loony-bin. I'd puzzled for<br>some time about how to get into Binfield House until finally it had<br>struck me that I'd only to tell them my wife was mad and I was<br>looking for somewhere to put her. After that they'd be quite ready<br>to show me round the grounds. In my new suit I probably looked<br>prosperous enough to have a wife in a private asylum. It wasn't<br>till I was actually at the gate that it occurred to me to wonder<br>whether the pool was still inside the grounds.<br><br>The old grounds of Binfield House had covered fifty acres, I<br>suppose, and the grounds of the loony-bin weren't likely to be more<br>than five or ten. They wouldn't want a great pool of water for the<br>loonies to drown themselves in. The lodge, where old Hodges used<br>to live, was the same as ever, but the yellow brick wall and the<br>huge iron gates were new. From the glimpse I got through the gates<br>I wouldn't have known the place. Gravel walks, flower-beds, lawns,<br>and a few aimless-looking types wandering about--loonies, I<br>suppose. I strolled up the road to the right. The pool--the big<br>pool, the one where I used to fish--was a couple of hundred yards<br>behind the house. It might have been a hundred yards before I got<br>to the corner of the wall. So the pool was outside the grounds.<br>The trees seemed to have got much thinner. I could hear children's<br>voices. And Gosh! there was the pool.<br><br>I stood for a moment, wondering what had happened to it. Then I<br>saw what it was--all the trees were gone from round its edge. It<br>looked all bare and different, in fact it looked extraordinarily<br>like the Round Pond in Kensington Gardens. Kids were playing all<br>round the edge, sailing boats and paddling, and a few rather older<br>kids were rushing about in those little canoes which you work by<br>turning a handle. Over to the left, where the old rotting boat-<br>house used to stand among the reeds, there was a sort of pavilion<br>and a sweet kiosk, and a huge white notice saying UPPER BINFIELD<br>MODEL YACHT CLUB.<br><br>I looked over to the right. It was all houses, houses, houses.<br>One might as well have been in the outer suburbs. All the woods<br>that used to grow beyond the pool, and grew so thick that they were<br>like a kind of tropical jungle, had been shaved flat. Only a few<br>clumps of trees still standing round the houses. There were arty-<br>looking houses, another of those sham-Tudor colonies like the one<br>I'd seen the first day at the top of Chamford Hill, only more so.<br>What a fool I'd been to imagine that these woods were still the<br>same! I saw how it was. There was just the one tiny bit of copse,<br>half a dozen acres perhaps, that hadn't been cut down, and it was<br>pure chance that I'd walked through it on my way here. Upper<br>Binfield, which had been merely a name in the old days, had grown<br>into a decent-sized town. In fact it was merely an outlying chunk<br>of Lower Binfield.<br><br>I wandered up to the edge of the pool. The kids were splashing<br>about and making the devil of a noise. There seemed to be swarms<br>of them. The water looked kind of dead. No fish in it now. There<br>was a chap standing watching the kids. He was an oldish chap with<br>a bald head and a few tufts of white hair, and pince-nez and very<br>sunburnt face. There was something vaguely queer about his<br>appearance. He was wearing shorts and sandals and one of those<br>celanese shirts open at the neck, I noticed, but what really struck<br>me was the look in his eye. He had very blue eyes that kind of<br>twinkled at you from behind his spectacles. I could see that he<br>was one of those old men who've never grown up. They're always<br>either health-food cranks or else they have something to do with<br>the Boy Scouts--in either case they're great ones for Nature and<br>the open air. He was looking at me as if he'd like to speak.<br><br>'Upper Binfield's grown a great deal,' I said.<br><br>He twinkled at me.<br><br>'Grown! My dear sir, we never allow Upper Binfield to grow. We<br>pride ourselves on being rather exceptional people up here, you<br>know. Just a little colony of us all by ourselves. No<br>interlopers--te-hee!'<br><br>'I mean compared with before the war,' I said. 'I used to live<br>here as a boy.'<br><br>'Oh-ah. No doubt. That was before my time, of course. But the<br>Upper Binfield Estate is something rather special in the way of<br>building estates, you know. Quite a little world of its own. All<br>designed by young Edward Watkin, the architect. You've heard of<br>him, of course. We live in the midst of Nature up here. No<br>connexion with the town down there'--he waved a hand in the<br>direction of Lower Binfield--'the dark satanic mills--te-hee!'<br><br>He had a benevolent old chuckle, and a way of wrinkling his face<br>up, like a rabbit. Immediately, as though I'd asked him, he began<br>telling me all about the Upper Binfield Estate and young Edward<br>Watkin, the architect, who had such a feeling for the Tudor, and<br>was such a wonderful fellow at finding genuine Elizabethan beams in<br>old farmhouses and buying them at ridiculous prices. And such an<br>interesting young fellow, quite the life and soul of the nudist<br>parties. He repeated a number of times that they were very<br>exceptional people in Upper Binfield, quite different from Lower<br>Binfield, they were determined to enrich the countryside instead of<br>defiling it (I'm using his own phrase), and there weren't any<br>public houses on the estate.<br><br>'They talk of their Garden Cities. But we call Upper Binfield the<br>Woodland City--te-hee! Nature!' He waved a hand at what was left<br>of the trees. 'The primeval forest brooding round us. Our young<br>people grow up amid surroundings of natural beauty. We are nearly<br>all of us enlightened people, of course. Would you credit that<br>three-quarters of us up here are vegetarians? The local butchers<br>don't like us at all--te-hee! And some quite eminent people live<br>here. Miss Helena Thurloe, the novelist--you've heard of her, of<br>course. And Professor Woad, the psychic research worker. Such a<br>poetic character! He goes wandering out into the woods and the<br>family can't find him at mealtimes. He says he's walking among the<br>fairies. Do you believe in fairies? I admit--te-hee!--I am just a<br>wee bit sceptical. But his photographs are most convincing.'<br><br>I began to wonder whether he was someone who'd escaped from<br>Binfield House. But no, he was sane enough, after a fashion. I<br>knew the type. Vegetarianism, simple life, poetry, nature-worship,<br>roll in the dew before breakfast. I'd met a few of them years ago<br>in Ealing. He began to show me round the estate. There was<br>nothing left of the woods. It was all houses, houses--and what<br>houses! Do you know these faked-up Tudor houses with the curly<br>roofs and the buttresses that don't buttress anything, and the<br>rock-gardens with concrete bird-baths and those red plaster elves<br>you can buy at the florists'? You could see in your mind's eye the<br>awful gang of food-cranks and spook-hunters and simple-lifers with<br>1,000 pounds a year that lived there. Even the pavements were<br>crazy. I didn't let him take me far. Some of the houses made me<br>wish I'd got a hand-grenade in my pocket. I tried to damp him down<br>by asking whether people didn't object to living so near the<br>lunatic asylum, but it didn't have much effect. Finally I stopped<br>and said:<br><br>'There used to be another pool, besides the big one. It can't be<br>far from here.'<br><br>'Another pool? Oh, surely not. I don't think there was ever<br>another pool.'<br><br>'They may have drained it off,' I said. 'It was a pretty deep<br>pool. It would leave a big pit behind.'<br><br>For the first time he looked a bit uneasy. He rubbed his nose.<br><br>'Oh-ah. Of course, you must understand our life up here is in some<br>ways primitive. The simple life, you know. We prefer it so. But<br>being so far from the town has its inconveniences, of course. Some<br>of our sanitary arrangements are not altogether satisfactory. The<br>dust-cart only calls once a month, I believe.'<br><br>'You mean they've turned the pool into a rubbish-dump?'<br><br>'Well, there IS something in the nature of a--' he shied at the<br>word rubbish-dump. 'We have to dispose of tins and so forth, of<br>course. Over there, behind that clump of trees.'<br><br>We went across there. They'd left a few trees to hid it. But yes,<br>there it was. It was my pool, all right. They'd drained the water<br>off. It made a great round hole, like an enormous well, twenty or<br>thirty feet deep. Already it was half full of tin cans.<br><br>I stood looking at the tin cans.<br><br>'It's a pity they drained it,' I said. 'There used to be some big<br>fish in that pool.'<br><br>'Fish? Oh, I never heard anything about that. Of course we could<br>hardly have a pool of water here among the houses. The mosquitoes,<br>you know. But it was before my time.'<br><br>'I suppose these houses have been built a good long time?' I said.<br><br>'Oh--ten or fifteen years, I think.'<br><br>'I used to know this place before the war,' I said. 'It was all<br>woods then. There weren't any houses except Binfield House. But<br>that little bit of copse over there hasn't changed. I walked<br>through it on my way here.'<br><br>'Ah, that! That is sacrosanct. We have decided never to build in<br>it. It is sacred to the young people. Nature, you know.' He<br>twinkled at me, a kind of roguish look, as if he was letting me<br>into a little secret: 'We call it the Pixy Glen.'<br><br>The Pixy Glen. I got rid of him, went back to the car and drove<br>down to Lower Binfield. The Pixy Glen. And they'd filled my pool<br>up with tin cans. God rot them and bust them! Say what you like--<br>call it silly, childish, anything--but doesn't it make you puke<br>sometimes to see what they're doing to England, with their bird-<br>baths and their plaster gnomes, and their pixies and tin cans,<br>where the beech woods used to be?<br><br>Sentimental, you say? Anti-social? Oughtn't to prefer trees to<br>men? I say it depends what trees and what men. Not that there's<br>anything one can do about it, except to wish them the pox in their<br>guts.<br><br>One thing, I thought as I drove down the hill, I'm finished with<br>this notion of getting back into the past. What's the good of<br>trying to revisit the scenes of your boyhood? They don't exist.<br>Coming up for air! But there isn't any air. The dustbin that<br>we're in reaches up to the stratosphere. All the same, I didn't<br>particularly care. After all, I thought, I've still got three days<br>left. I'd have a bit of peace and quiet, and stop bothering about<br>what they'd done to Lower Binfield. As for my idea of going<br>fishing--that was off, of course. Fishing, indeed! At my age!<br>Really, Hilda was right.<br><br>I dumped the car in the garage of the George and walked into the<br>lounge. It was six o'clock. Somebody had switched on the wireless<br>and the news-broadcast was beginning. I came through the door just<br>in time to hear the last few words of an S.O.S. And it gave me a<br>bit of a jolt, I admit. For the words I heard were:<br><br>'--where his wife, Hilda Bowling, is seriously ill.'<br><br>The next instant the plummy voice went on: 'Here is another S.O.S.<br>Will Percival Chute, who was last heard of--', but I didn't wait to<br>hear any more. I just walked straight on. What made me feel<br>rather proud, when I thought it over afterwards, was that when I<br>heard those words come out of the loudspeaker I never turned an<br>eyelash. Not even a pause in my step to let anyone know that I was<br>George Bowling, whose wife Hilda Bowling was seriously ill. The<br>landlord's wife was in the lounge, and she knew my name was<br>Bowling, at any rate she'd seen it in the register. Otherwise<br>there was nobody there except a couple of chaps who were staying at<br>the George and who didn't know me from Adam. But I kept my head.<br>Not a sign to anyone. I merely walked on into the private bar,<br>which had just opened, and ordered my pint as usual.<br><br>I had to think it over. By the time I'd drunk about half the pint<br>I began to get the bearings of the situation. In the first place,<br>Hilda WASN'T ill, seriously or otherwise. I knew that. She'd been<br>perfectly well when I came away, and it wasn't the time of the year<br>for 'flu or anything of that kind. She was shamming. Why?<br><br>Obviously it was just another of her dodges. I saw how it was.<br>She'd got wind somehow--trust Hilda!--that I wasn't really at<br>Birmingham, and this was just her way of getting me home. Couldn't<br>bear to think of me any longer with that other woman. Because of<br>course she'd take it for granted that I was with a woman. Can't<br>imagine any other motive. And naturally she assumed that I'd come<br>rushing home as soon as I heard she was ill.<br><br>But that's just where you've got it wrong, I thought to myself as<br>I finished off the pint. I'm too cute to be caught that way. I<br>remembered the dodges she'd pulled before, and the extraordinary<br>trouble she'll take to catch me out. I've even known her, when I'd<br>been on some journey she was suspicious about, check it all up with<br>a Bradshaw and a road-map, just to see whether I was telling the<br>truth about my movements. And then there was that time when she<br>followed me all the way to Colchester and suddenly burst in on me<br>at the Temperance Hotel. And that time, unfortunately, she<br>happened to be right--at least, she wasn't, but there were<br>circumstances which made it look as if she was. I hadn't the<br>slightest belief that she was ill. In fact, I knew she wasn't,<br>although I couldn't say exactly how.<br><br>I had another pint and things looked better. Of course there was<br>a row coming when I got home, but there'd have been a row anyway.<br>I've got three good days ahead of me, I thought. Curiously enough,<br>now that the things I'd come to look for had turned out not to<br>exist, the idea of having a bit of holiday appealed to me all the<br>more. Being away from home--that was the great thing. Peace<br>perfect peace with loved ones far away, as the hymn puts it. And<br>suddenly I decided that I WOULD have a woman if I felt like it. It<br>would serve Hilda right for being so dirty-minded, and besides,<br>where's the sense of being suspected if it isn't true?<br><br>But as the second pint worked inside me, the thing began to amuse<br>me. I hadn't fallen for it, but it was damned ingenious all the<br>same. I wondered how she'd managed about the S.O.S. I've no idea<br>what the procedure is. Do you have to have a doctor's certificate,<br>or do you just send your name in? I felt pretty sure it was the<br>Wheeler woman who'd put her up to it. It seemed to me to have the<br>Wheeler touch.<br><br>But all the same, the cheek of it! The lengths that women will go!<br>Sometimes you can't help kind of admiring them. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/20.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/22.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
