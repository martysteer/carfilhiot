<h2>Part 1, Chapter 4</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">I'd dropped my papers at the office. Warner is one of these cheap<br>American dentists, and he has his consulting-room, or 'parlour' as<br>he likes to call it, halfway up a big block of offices, between a<br>photographer and a rubber-goods wholesaler. I was early for my<br>appointment, but it was time for a bit of grub. I don't know what<br>put it into my head to go into a milk-bar. They're places I<br>generally avoid. We five-to-ten-pound-a-weekers aren't well served<br>in the way of eating-places in London. If your idea of the amount<br>to spend on a meal is one and threepence, it's either Lyons, the<br>Express Dairy, or the A.B.C., or else it's the kind of funeral<br>snack they serve you in the saloon bar, a pint of bitter and a slab<br>of cold pie, so cold that it's colder than the beer. Outside the<br>milk-bar the boys were yelling the first editions of the evening<br>papers.<br><br>Behind the bright red counter a girl in a tall white cap was<br>fiddling with an ice-box, and somewhere at the back a radio was<br>playing, plonk-tiddle-tiddle-plonk, a kind of tinny sound. Why the<br>hell am I coming here? I thought to myself as I went in. There's a<br>kind of atmosphere about these places that gets me down. Everything<br>slick and shiny and streamlined; mirrors, enamel, and chromium plate<br>whichever direction you look in. Everything spent on the decorations<br>and nothing on the food. No real food at all. Just lists of stuff<br>with American names, sort of phantom stuff that you can't taste and<br>can hardly believe in the existence of. Everything comes out of a<br>carton or a tin, or it's hauled out of a refrigerator or squirted<br>out of a tap or squeezed out of a tube. No comfort, no privacy.<br>Tall stools to sit on, a kind of narrow ledge to eat off, mirrors<br>all round you. A sort of propaganda floating round, mixed up with<br>the noise of the radio, to the effect that food doesn't matter,<br>comfort doesn't matter, nothing matters except slickness and<br>shininess and streamlining. Everything's streamlined nowadays, even<br>the bullet Hitler's keeping for you. I ordered a large coffee and a<br>couple of frankfurters. The girl in the white cap jerked them at me<br>with about as much interest as you'd throw ants' eggs to a goldfish.<br><br>Outside the door a newsboy yelled 'StarnoosstanNERD!' I saw the<br>poster flapping against his knees: LEGS. FRESH DISCOVERIES. Just<br>'legs', you notice. It had got down to that. Two days earlier<br>they'd found a woman's legs in a railway waiting-room, done up in a<br>brown-paper parcel, and what with successive editions of the<br>papers, the whole nation was supposed to be so passionately<br>interested in these blasted legs that they didn't need any further<br>introduction. They were the only legs that were news at the<br>moment. It's queer, I thought, as I ate a bit of roll, how dull<br>the murders are getting nowadays. All this cutting people up and<br>leaving bits of them about the countryside. Not a patch on the old<br>domestic poisoning dramas, Crippen, Seddon, Mrs Maybrick; the truth<br>being, I suppose, that you can't do a good murder unless you<br>believe you're going to roast in hell for it.<br><br>At this moment I bit into one of my frankfurters, and--Christ!<br><br>I can't honestly say that I'd expected the thing to have a pleasant<br>taste. I'd expected it to taste of nothing, like the roll. But<br>this--well, it was quite an experience. Let me try and describe it<br>to you.<br><br>The frankfurter had a rubber skin, of course, and my temporary<br>teeth weren't much of a fit. I had to do a kind of sawing movement<br>before I could get my teeth through the skin. And then suddenly--<br>pop! The thing burst in my mouth like a rotten pear. A sort of<br>horrible soft stuff was oozing all over my tongue. But the taste!<br>For a moment I just couldn't believe it. Then I rolled my tongue<br>round it again and had another try. It was FISH! A sausage, a<br>thing calling itself a frankfurter, filled with fish! I got up and<br>walked straight out without touching my coffee. God knows what<br>that might have tasted of.<br><br>Outside the newsboy shoved the Standard into my face and yelled,<br>'Legs! 'Orrible revelations! All the winners! Legs! Legs!' I<br>was still rolling the stuff round my tongue, wondering where I<br>could spit it out. I remembered a bit I'd read in the paper<br>somewhere about these food-factories in Germany where everything's<br>made out of something else. Ersatz, they call it. I remembered<br>reading that THEY were making sausages out of fish, and fish, no<br>doubt, out of something different. It gave me the feeling that I'd<br>bitten into the modern world and discovered what it was really made<br>of. That's the way we're going nowadays. Everything slick and<br>streamlined, everything made out of something else. Celluloid,<br>rubber, chromium-steel everywhere, arc-lamps blazing all night,<br>glass roofs over your head, radios all playing the same tune, no<br>vegetation left, everything cemented over, mock-turtles grazing<br>under the neutral fruit-trees. But when you come down to brass<br>tacks and get your teeth into something solid, a sausage for<br>instance, that's what you get. Rotten fish in a rubber skin.<br>Bombs of filth bursting inside your mouth.<br><br>When I'd got the new teeth in I felt a lot better. They sat nice<br>and smooth over the gums, and though very likely it sounds absurd<br>to say that false teeth can make you feel younger, it's a fact that<br>they did so. I tried a smile at myself in a shop window. They<br>weren't half bad. Warner, though cheap, is a bit of an artist and<br>doesn't aim at making you look like a toothpaste advert. He's got<br>huge cabinets full of false teeth--he showed them to me once--all<br>graded according to size and colour, and he picks them out like a<br>jeweller choosing stones for a necklace. Nine people out of ten<br>would have taken my teeth for natural.<br><br>I caught a full-length glimpse of myself in another window I was<br>passing, and it struck me that really I wasn't such a bad figure of<br>a man. A bit on the fat side, admittedly, but nothing offensive,<br>only what the tailors call a 'full figure', and some women like a<br>man to have a red face. There's life in the old dog yet, I<br>thought. I remembered my seventeen quid, and definitely made up my<br>mind that I'd spend it on a woman. There was time to have a pint<br>before the pubs shut, just to baptize the teeth, and feeling rich<br>because of my seventeen quid I stopped at a tobacconist's and<br>bought myself a sixpenny cigar of a kind I'm rather partial to.<br>They're eight inches long and guaranteed pure Havana leaf all<br>through. I suppose cabbages grow in Havana the same as anywhere<br>else.<br><br>When I came out of the pub I felt quite different.<br><br>I'd had a couple of pints, they'd warmed me up inside, and the<br>cigar smoke oozing round my new teeth gave me a fresh, clean,<br>peaceful sort of feeling. All of a sudden I felt kind of<br>thoughtful and philosophic. It was partly because I didn't have<br>any work to do. My mind went back to the thoughts of war I'd been<br>having earlier that morning, when the bomber flew over the train.<br>I felt in a kind of prophetic mood, the mood in which you foresee<br>the end of the world and get a certain kick out of it.<br><br>I was walking westward up the Strand, and though it was coldish I<br>went slowly to get the pleasure of my cigar. The usual crowd that<br>you can hardly fight your way through was streaming up the<br>pavement, all of them with that insane fixed expression on their<br>faces that people have in London streets, and there was the usual<br>jam of traffic with the great red buses nosing their way between<br>the cars, and the engines roaring and horns tooting. Enough noise<br>to waken the dead, but not to waken this lot, I thought. I felt as<br>if I was the only person awake in a city of sleep-walkers. That's<br>an illusion, of course. When you walk through a crowd of strangers<br>it's next door to impossible not to imagine that they're all<br>waxworks, but probably they're thinking just the same about you.<br>And this kind of prophetic feeling that keeps coming over me<br>nowadays, the feeling that war's just round the corner and that<br>war's the end of all things, isn't peculiar to me. We've all got<br>it, more or less. I suppose even among the people passing at that<br>moment there must have been chaps who were seeing mental pictures<br>of the shellbursts and the mud. Whatever thought you think there's<br>always a million people thinking it at the same moment. But that<br>was how I felt. We're all on the burning deck and nobody knows it<br>except me. I looked at the dumb-bell faces streaming past. Like<br>turkeys in November, I thought. Not a notion of what's coming to<br>them. It was as if I'd got X-rays in my eyes and could see the<br>skeletons walking.<br><br>I looked forward a few years. I saw this street as it'll be in<br>five years' time, say, or three years' time (1941 they say it's<br>booked for), after the fighting's started.<br><br>No, not all smashed to pieces. Only a little altered, kind of<br>chipped and dirty-looking, the shop-windows almost empty and so<br>dusty that you can't see into them. Down a side street there's an<br>enormous bomb-crater and a block of buildings burnt out so that it<br>looks like a hollow tooth. Thermite. It's all curiously quiet,<br>and everyone's very thin. A platoon of soldiers comes marching up<br>the street. They're all as thin as rakes and their boots are<br>dragging. The sergeant's got corkscrew moustaches and holds<br>himself like a ramrod, but he's thin too and he's got a cough that<br>almost tears him open. Between his coughs he's trying to bawl at<br>them in the old parade-ground style. 'Nah then, Jones! Lift yer<br>'ed up! What yer keep starin' at the ground for? All them fag-<br>ends was picked up years ago.' Suddenly a fit of coughing catches<br>him. He tries to stop it, can't, doubles up like a ruler, and<br>almost coughs his guts out. His face turns pink and purple, his<br>moustache goes limp, and the water runs out of his eyes.<br><br>I can hear the air-raid sirens blowing and the loud-speakers<br>bellowing that our glorious troops have taken a hundred thousand<br>prisoners. I see a top-floor-back in Birmingham and a child of<br>five howling and howling for a bit of bread. And suddenly the<br>mother can't stand it any longer, and she yells at it, 'Shut your<br>trap, you little bastard!' and then she ups the child's frock and<br>smacks its bottom hard, because there isn't any bread and isn't<br>going to be any bread. I see it all. I see the posters and the<br>food-queues, and the castor oil and the rubber truncheons and the<br>machine-guns squirting out of bedroom windows.<br><br>Is it going to happen? No knowing. Some days it's impossible to<br>believe it. Some days I say to myself that it's just a scare got<br>up by the newspapers. Some days I know in my bones there's no<br>escaping it.<br><br>When I got down near Charing Cross the boys were yelling a later<br>edition of the evening papers. There was some more drivel about<br>the murder. LEGS. FAMOUS SURGEON'S STATEMENT. Then another<br>poster caught my eye: KING ZOG'S WEDDING POSTPONED. King Zog!<br>What a name! It's next door to impossible to believe a chap with a<br>name like that isn't a jet-black Negro.<br><br>But just at that moment a queer thing happened. King Zog's name--<br>but I suppose, as I'd already seen the name several times that day,<br>it was mixed up with some sound in the traffic or the smell of<br>horse-dung or something--had started memories in me.<br><br>The past is a curious thing. It's with you all the time. I<br>suppose an hour never passes without your thinking of things that<br>happened ten or twenty years ago, and yet most of the time it's got<br>no reality, it's just a set of facts that you've learned, like a<br>lot of stuff in a history book. Then some chance sight or sound or<br>smell, especially smell, sets you going, and the past doesn't<br>merely come back to you, you're actually IN the past. It was like<br>that at this moment.<br><br>I was back in the parish church at Lower Binfield, and it was<br>thirty-eight years ago. To outward appearances, I suppose, I was<br>still walking down the Strand, fat and forty-five, with false teeth<br>and a bowler hat, but inside me I was Georgie Bowling, aged seven,<br>younger son of Samuel Bowling, corn and seed merchant, of 57 High<br>Street, Lower Binfield. And it was Sunday morning, and I could<br>smell the church. How I could smell it! You know the smell<br>churches have, a peculiar, dank, dusty, decaying, sweetish sort of<br>smell. There's a touch of candle-grease in it, and perhaps a whiff<br>of incense and a suspicion of mice, and on Sunday mornings it's a<br>bit overlaid by yellow soap and serge dresses, but predominantly<br>it's that sweet, dusty, musty smell that's like the smell of death<br>and life mixed up together. It's powdered corpses, really.<br><br>In those days I was about four feet high. I was standing on the<br>hassock so as to see over the pew in front, and I could feel<br>Mother's black serge dress under my hand. I could also feel my<br>stockings pulled up over my knees--we used to wear them like that<br>then--and the saw edge of the Eton collar they used to buckle me<br>into on Sunday mornings. And I could hear the organ wheezing and<br>two enormous voices bellowing out the psalm. In our church there<br>were two men who led the singing, in fact they did so much of the<br>singing that nobody else got much of a chance. One was Shooter,<br>the fishmonger, and the other was old Wetherall, the joiner and<br>undertaker. They used to sit opposite one another on either side<br>of the nave, in the pews nearest the pulpit. Shooter was a short<br>fat man with a very pink, smooth face, a big nose, drooping<br>moustache, and a chin that kind of fell away beneath his mouth.<br>Wetherall was quite different. He was a great, gaunt, powerful old<br>devil of about sixty, with a face like a death's-head and stiff<br>grey hair half an inch long all over his head. I've never seen a<br>living man who looked so exactly like a skeleton. You could see<br>every line of the skull in his face, his skin was like parchment,<br>and his great lantern jaw full of yellow teeth worked up and down<br>just like the jaw of a skeleton in an anatomical museum. And yet<br>with all his leanness he looked as strong as iron, as though he'd<br>live to be a hundred and make coffins for everyone in that church<br>before he'd finished. Their voices were quite different, too.<br>Shooter had a kind of desperate, agonized bellow, as though someone<br>had a knife at his throat and he was just letting out his last yell<br>for help. But Wetherall had a tremendous, churning, rumbling noise<br>that happened deep down inside him, like enormous barrels being<br>rolled to and fro underground. However much noise he let out, you<br>always knew he'd got plenty more in reserve. The kids nicknamed<br>him Rumbletummy.<br><br>They used to get up a kind of antiphonal effect, especially in the<br>psalms. It was always Wetherall who had the last word. I suppose<br>really they were friends in private life, but in my kid's way I<br>used to imagine that they were deadly enemies and trying to shout<br>one another down. Shooter would roar out 'The Lord is my<br>shepherd', and then Wetherall would come in with 'Therefore can I<br>lack nothing', drowning him completely. You always knew which of<br>the two was master. I used especially to look forward to that<br>psalm that has the bit about Sihon king of the Amorites and Og the<br>king of Bashan (this was what King Zog's name had reminded me of).<br>Shooter would start off with 'Sihon king of the Amorites', then<br>perhaps for half a second you could hear the rest of the<br>congregation singing the 'and', and then Wetherall's enormous bass<br>would come in like a tidal wave and swallow everybody up with 'Og<br>the king of Bashan'. I wish I could make you hear the tremendous,<br>rumbling, subterranean barrel-noise that he could get into that<br>word 'Og'. He even used to clip off the end of the 'and', so that<br>when I was a very small kid I used to think it was Dog the king of<br>Bashan. But later, when I got the names right, I formed a picture<br>in my mind's eye of Sihon and Og. I saw them as a couple of those<br>great Egyptian statues that I'd seen pictures of in the penny<br>encyclopedia, enormous stone statues thirty feet high, sitting on<br>their thrones opposite one another, with their hands on their knees<br>and a faint mysterious smile on their faces.<br><br>How it came back to me! That peculiar feeling--it was only a<br>feeling, you couldn't describe it as an activity--that we used to<br>call 'Church'. The sweet corpsy smell, the rustle of Sunday<br>dresses, the wheeze of the organ and the roaring voices, the spot<br>of light from the hole in the window creeping slowly up the nave.<br>In some way the grown-ups could put it across that this extraordinary<br>performance was necessary. You took it for granted, just as you<br>took the Bible, which you got in big doses in those days. There<br>were texts on every wall and you knew whole chapters of the O.T. by<br>heart. Even now my head's stuffed full of bits out of the Bible.<br>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord.<br>And Asher abode in his breeches. Followed them from Dan until thou<br>come unto Beersheba. Smote him under the fifth rib, so that he<br>died. You never understood it, you didn't try to or want to, it was<br>just a kind of medicine, a queer-tasting stuff that you had to<br>swallow and knew to be in some way necessary. An extraordinary<br>rigmarole about people with names like Shimei and Nebuchadnezzar and<br>Ahithophel and Hashbadada; people with long stiff garments and<br>Assyrian beards, riding up and down on camels among temples and<br>cedar trees and doing extraordinary things. Sacrificing burnt<br>offerings, walking about in fiery furnaces, getting nailed on<br>crosses, getting swallowed by whales. And all mixed up with the<br>sweet graveyard smell and the serge dresses and the wheeze of the<br>organ.<br><br>That was the world I went back to when I saw the poster about King<br>Zog. For a moment I didn't merely remember it, I was IN it. Of<br>course such impressions don't last more than a few seconds. A<br>moment later it was as though I'd opened my eyes again, and I was<br>forty-five and there was a traffic jam in the Strand. But it had<br>left a kind of after-effect behind. Sometimes when you come out of<br>a train of thought you feel as if you were coming up from deep<br>water, but this time it was the other way about, it was as though<br>it was back in 1900 that I'd been breathing real air. Even now,<br>with my eyes open, so to speak, all those bloody fools hustling to<br>and fro, and the posters and the petrol-stink and the roar of the<br>engines, seemed to me less real than Sunday morning in Lower<br>Binfield thirty-eight years ago.<br><br>I chucked away my cigar and walked on slowly. I could smell the<br>corpse-smell. In a manner of speaking I can smell it now. I'm<br>back in Lower Binfield, and the year's 1900. Beside the horse-<br>trough in the market-place the carrier's horse is having its nose-<br>bag. At the sweet-shop on the corner Mother Wheeler is weighing<br>out a ha'porth of brandy balls. Lady Rampling's carriage is<br>driving by, with the tiger sitting behind in his pipeclayed<br>breeches with his arms folded. Uncle Ezekiel is cursing Joe<br>Chamberlain. The recruiting-sergeant in his scarlet jacket, tight<br>blue overalls, and pillbox hat, is strutting up and down twisting<br>his moustache. The drunks are puking in the yard behind the<br>George. Vicky's at Windsor, God's in heaven, Christ's on the<br>cross, Jonah's in the whale, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are in<br>the fiery furnace, and Sihon king of the Amorites and Og the king<br>of Bashan are sitting on their thrones looking at one another--not<br>doing anything exactly, just existing, keeping their appointed<br>place, like a couple of fire-dogs, or the Lion and the Unicorn.<br><br>Is it gone for ever? I'm not certain. But I tell you it was a<br>good world to live in. I belong to it. So do you. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/2.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/4.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
