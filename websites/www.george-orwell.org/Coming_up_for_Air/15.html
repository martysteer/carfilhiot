<h2>Part 3, Chapter 2</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The primroses had started. I suppose it was some time in March.<br><br>I'd driven through Westerham and was making for Pudley. I'd got to<br>do an assessment of an ironmonger's shop, and then, if I could get<br>hold of him, to interview a life-insurance case who was wavering in<br>the balance. His name had been sent in by our local agent, but at<br>the last moment he'd taken fright and begun to doubt whether he<br>could afford it. I'm pretty good at talking people round. It's<br>being fat that does it. It puts people in a cheery kind of mood,<br>makes 'em feel that signing a cheque is almost a pleasure. Of<br>course there are different ways of tackling different people. With<br>some it's better to lay all the stress on the bonuses, others you<br>can scare in a subtle way with hints about what'll happen to their<br>wives if they die uninsured.<br><br>The old car switchbacked up and down the curly little hills. And<br>by God, what a day! You know the kind of day that generally comes<br>some time in March when winter suddenly seems to give up fighting.<br>For days past we'd been having the kind of beastly weather that<br>people call 'bright' weather, when the sky's a cold hard blue and<br>the wind scrapes you like a blunt razor-blade. Then suddenly the<br>wind had dropped and the sun got a chance. You know the kind of<br>day. Pale yellow sunshine, not a leaf stirring, a touch of mist in<br>the far distance where you could see the sheep scattered over the<br>hillsides like lumps of chalk. And down in the valleys fires were<br>burning, and the smoke twisted slowly upwards and melted into the<br>mist. I'd got the road to myself. It was so warm you could almost<br>have taken your clothes off.<br><br>I got to a spot where the grass beside the road was smothered in<br>primroses. A patch of clayey soil, perhaps. Twenty yards farther<br>on I slowed down and stopped. The weather was too good to miss. I<br>felt I'd got to get out and have a smell at the spring air, and<br>perhaps even pick a few primroses if there was nobody coming. I<br>even had some vague notion of picking a bunch of them to take home<br>to Hilda.<br><br>I switched the engine off and got out. I never like leaving the<br>old car running in neutral, I'm always half afraid she'll shake her<br>mudguards off or something. She's a 1927 model, and she's done a<br>biggish mileage. When you lift the bonnet and look at the engine<br>it reminds you of the old Austrian Empire, all tied together with<br>bits of string but somehow keeps plugging along. You wouldn't<br>believe any machine could vibrate in so many directions at once.<br>It's like the motion of the earth, which has twenty-two different<br>kinds of wobble, or so I remember reading. If you look at her from<br>behind when she's running in neutral it's for all the world like<br>watching one of those Hawaiian girls dancing the hula-hula.<br><br>There was a five-barred gate beside the road. I strolled over and<br>leaned across it. Not a soul in sight. I hitched my hat back a<br>bit to get the kind of balmy feeling of the air against my<br>forehead. The grass under the hedge was full of primroses. Just<br>inside the gate a tramp or somebody had left the remains of a fire.<br>A little pile of white embers and a wisp of smoke still oozing out<br>of them. Farther along there was a little bit of a pool, covered<br>over with duck-weed. The field was winter wheat. It sloped up<br>sharply, and then there was a fall of chalk and a little beech<br>spinney. A kind of mist of young leaves on the trees. And utter<br>stillness everywhere. Not even enough wind to stir the ashes of<br>the fire. A lark singing somewhere, otherwise not a sound, not<br>even an aeroplane.<br><br>I stayed there for a bit, leaning over the gate. I was alone,<br>quite alone. I was looking at the field, and the field was looking<br>at me. I felt--I wonder whether you'll understand.<br><br>What I felt was something that's so unusual nowadays that to say it<br>sounds like foolishness. I felt HAPPY. I felt that though I<br>shan't live for ever, I'd be quite ready to. If you like you can<br>say that that was merely because it was the first day of spring.<br>Seasonal effect on the sex-glands, or something. But there was<br>more to it than that. Curiously enough, the thing that had<br>suddenly convinced me that life was worth living, more than the<br>primroses or the young buds on the hedge, was that bit of fire near<br>the gate. You know the look of a wood fire on a still day. The<br>sticks that have gone all to white ash and still keep the shape of<br>sticks, and under the ash the kind of vivid red that you can see<br>into. It's curious that a red ember looks more alive, gives you<br>more of a feeling of life than any living thing. There's something<br>about it, a kind of intensity, a vibration--I can't think of the<br>exact words. But it lets you know that you're alive yourself.<br>It's the spot on the picture that makes you notice everything else.<br><br>I bent down to pick a primrose. Couldn't reach it--too much belly.<br>I squatted down on my haunches and picked a little bunch of them.<br>Lucky there was no one to see me. The leaves were kind of crinkly<br>and shaped like rabbits' ears. I stood up and put my bunch of<br>primroses on the gatepost. Then on an impulse I slid my false<br>teeth out of my mouth and had a look at them.<br><br>If I'd had a mirror I'd have looked at the whole of myself, though,<br>as a matter of fact, I knew what I looked like already. A fat man<br>of forty-five, in a grey herring-bone suit a bit the worse for wear<br>and a bowler hat. Wife, two kids, and a house in the suburbs<br>written all over me. Red face and boiled blue eyes. I know, you<br>don't have to tell me. But the thing that struck me, as I gave my<br>dental plate the once-over before slipping it back into my mouth,<br>was that IT DOESN'T MATTER. Even false teeth don't matter. I'm<br>fat--yes. I look like a bookie's unsuccessful brother--yes. No<br>woman will ever go to bed with me again unless she's paid to. I<br>know all that. But I tell you I don't care. I don't want the<br>women, I don't even want to be young again. I only want to be<br>alive. And I was alive that moment when I stood looking at the<br>primroses and the red embers under the hedge. It's a feeling<br>inside you, a kind of peaceful feeling, and yet it's like a flame.<br><br>Farther down the hedge the pool was covered with duck-weed, so like<br>a carpet that if you didn't know what duck-weed was you might think<br>it was solid and step on it. I wondered why it is that we're all<br>such bloody fools. Why don't people, instead of the idiocies they<br>do spend their time on, just walk round LOOKING at things? That<br>pool, for instance--all the stuff that's in it. Newts, water-<br>snails, water-beetles, caddis-flies, leeches, and God knows how<br>many other things that you can only see with a microscope. The<br>mystery of their lives, down there under water. You could spend a<br>lifetime watching them, ten lifetimes, and still you wouldn't have<br>got to the end even of that one pool. And all the while the sort<br>of feeling of wonder, the peculiar flame inside you. It's the only<br>thing worth having, and we don't want it.<br><br>But I do want it. At least I thought so at that moment. And don't<br>mistake what I'm saying. To begin with, unlike most Cockneys, I'm<br>not soppy about 'the country'. I was brought up a damn sight too<br>near to it for that. I don't want to stop people living in towns,<br>or in suburbs for that matter. Let 'em live where they like. And<br>I'm not suggesting that the whole of humanity could spend the whole<br>of their lives wandering round picking primroses and so forth.<br>I know perfectly well that we've got to work. It's only because<br>chaps are coughing their lungs out in mines and girls are hammering<br>at typewriters that anyone ever has time to pick a flower.<br>Besides, if you hadn't a full belly and a warm house you wouldn't<br>want to pick flowers. But that's not the point. Here's this<br>feeling that I get inside me--not often, I admit, but now and<br>again. I know it's a good feeling to have. What's more, so does<br>everybody else, or nearly everybody. It's just round the corner<br>all the time, and we all know it's there. Stop firing that<br>machine-gun! Stop chasing whatever you're chasing! Calm down, get<br>your breath back, let a bit of peace seep into your bones. No use.<br>We don't do it. Just keep on with the same bloody fooleries.<br><br>And the next war coming over the horizon, 1941, they say. Three<br>more circles of the sun, and then we whizz straight into it. The<br>bombs diving down on you like black cigars, and the streamlined<br>bullets streaming from the Bren machine-guns. Not that that<br>worries me particularly. I'm too old to fight. There'll be air-<br>raids, of course, but they won't hit everybody. Besides, even if<br>that kind of danger exists, it doesn't really enter into one's<br>thoughts beforehand. As I've said several times already, I'm not<br>frightened of the war, only the after-war. And even that isn't<br>likely to affect me personally. Because who'd bother about a chap<br>like me? I'm too fat to be a political suspect. No one would bump<br>me off or cosh me with a rubber truncheon. I'm the ordinary<br>middling kind that moves on when the policeman tells him. As for<br>Hilda and the kids, they'd probably never notice the difference.<br>And yet it frightens me. The barbed wire! The slogans! The<br>enormous faces! The cork-lined cellars where the executioner plugs<br>you from behind! For that matter it frightens other chaps who are<br>intellectually a good deal dumber than I am. But why! Because it<br>means good-bye to this thing I've been telling you about, this<br>special feeling inside you. Call it peace, if you like. But when<br>I say peace I don't mean absence of war, I mean peace, a feeling in<br>your guts. And it's gone for ever if the rubber truncheon boys get<br>hold of us.<br><br>I picked up my bunch of primroses and had a smell at them. I was<br>thinking of Lower Binfield. It was funny how for two months past<br>it had been in and out of my mind all the time, after twenty years<br>during which I'd practically forgotten it. And just at this moment<br>there was the zoom of a car coming up the road.<br><br>It brought me up with a kind of jolt. I suddenly realized what I<br>was doing--wandering round picking primroses when I ought to have<br>been going through the inventory at that ironmonger's shop in<br>Pudley. What was more, it suddenly struck me what I'd look like if<br>those people in the car saw me. A fat man in a bowler hat holding<br>a bunch of primroses! It wouldn't look right at all. Fat men<br>mustn't pick primroses, at any rate in public. I just had time to<br>chuck them over the hedge before the car came in sight. It was a<br>good job I'd done so. The car was full of young fools of about<br>twenty. How they'd have sniggered if they'd seen me! They were<br>all looking at me--you know how people look at you when they're in<br>a car coming towards you--and the thought struck me that even now<br>they might somehow guess what I'd been doing. Better let 'em think<br>it was something else. Why should a chap get out of his car at the<br>side of a country road? Obvious! As the car went past I pretended<br>to be doing up a fly-button.<br><br>I cranked up the car (the self-starter doesn't work any longer) and<br>got in. Curiously enough, in the very moment when I was doing up<br>the fly-button, when my mind was about three-quarters full of those<br>young fools in the other car, a wonderful idea had occurred to me.<br><br>I'd go back to Lower Binfield!<br><br>Why not? I thought as I jammed her into top gear. Why shouldn't I?<br>What was to stop me? And why the hell hadn't I thought of it<br>before? A quiet holiday in Lower Binfield--just the thing I<br>wanted.<br><br>Don't imagine that I had any ideas of going back to LIVE in Lower<br>Binfield. I wasn't planning to desert Hilda and the kids and start<br>life under a different name. That kind of thing only happens in<br>books. But what was to stop me slipping down to Lower Binfield and<br>having a week there all by myself, on the Q.T.?<br><br>I seemed to have it all planned out in my mind already. It was all<br>right as far as the money went. There was still twelve quid left<br>in that secret pile of mine, and you can have a very comfortable<br>week on twelve quid. I get a fortnight's holiday a year, generally<br>in August or September. But if I made up some suitable story--<br>relative dying of incurable disease, or something--I could probably<br>get the firm to give me my holiday in two separate halves. Then I<br>could have a week all to myself before Hilda knew what was<br>happening. A week in Lower Binfield, with no Hilda, no kids, no<br>Flying Salamander, no Ellesmere Road, no rumpus about the hire-<br>purchase payments, no noise of traffic driving you silly--just a<br>week of loafing round and listening to the quietness?<br><br>But why did I want to go back to Lower Binfield? you say. Why<br>Lower Binfield in particular? What did I mean to do when I got<br>there?<br><br>I didn't mean to do anything. That was part of the point. I<br>wanted peace and quiet. Peace! We had it once, in Lower Binfield.<br>I've told you something about our old life there, before the war.<br>I'm not pretending it was perfect. I dare say it was a dull,<br>sluggish, vegetable kind of life. You can say we were like<br>turnips, if you like. But turnips don't live in terror of the<br>boss, they don't lie awake at night thinking about the next slump<br>and the next war. We had peace inside us. Of course I knew that<br>even in Lower Binfield life would have changed. But the place<br>itself wouldn't have. There'd still be the beech woods round<br>Binfield House, and the towpath down by Burford Weir, and the<br>horse-trough in the market-place. I wanted to get back there, just<br>for a week, and let the feeling of it soak into me. It was a bit<br>like one of these Eastern sages retiring into a desert. And I<br>should think, the way things are going, there'll be a good many<br>people retiring into the desert during the next few years. It'll<br>be like the time in ancient Rome that old Porteous was telling me<br>about, when there were so many hermits that there was a waiting<br>list for every cave.<br><br>But it wasn't that I wanted to watch my navel. I only wanted to<br>get my nerve back before the bad times begin. Because does anyone<br>who isn't dead from the neck up doubt that there's a bad time<br>coming? We don't even know what it'll be, and yet we know it's<br>coming. Perhaps a war, perhaps a slump--no knowing, except that<br>it'll be something bad. Wherever we're going, we're going<br>downwards. Into the grave, into the cesspool--no knowing. And you<br>can't face that kind of thing unless you've got the right feeling<br>inside you. There's something that's gone out of us in these<br>twenty years since the war. It's a kind of vital juice that we've<br>squirted away until there's nothing left. All this rushing to and<br>fro! Everlasting scramble for a bit of cash. Everlasting din of<br>buses, bombs, radios, telephone bells. Nerves worn all to bits,<br>empty places in our bones where the marrow ought to be.<br><br>I shoved my foot down on the accelerator. The very thought of<br>going back to Lower Binfield had done me good already. You know<br>the feeling I had. Coming up for air! Like the big sea-turtles<br>when they come paddling up to the surface, stick their noses out<br>and fill their lungs with a great gulp before they sink down again<br>among the seaweed and the octopuses. We're all stifling at the<br>bottom of a dustbin, but I'd found the way to the top. Back to<br>Lower Binfield! I kept my foot on the accelerator until the old<br>car worked up to her maximum speed of nearly forty miles an hour.<br>She was rattling like a tin tray full of crockery, and under cover<br>of the noise I nearly started singing.<br><br>Of course the fly in the milk-jug was Hilda. That thought pulled<br>me up a bit. I slowed down to about twenty to think it over.<br><br>There wasn't much doubt Hilda would find out sooner or later. As<br>to getting only a week's holiday in August, I might be able to pass<br>that off all right. I could tell her the firm were only giving me<br>a week this year. Probably she wouldn't ask too many questions<br>about that, because she'd jump at the chance of cutting down the<br>holiday expenses. The kids, in any case, always stay at the<br>seaside for a month. Where the difficulty came in was finding an<br>alibi for that week in May. I couldn't just clear off without<br>notice. Best thing, I thought, would be to tell her a good while<br>ahead that I was being sent on some special job to Nottingham, or<br>Derby, or Bristol, or some other place a good long way away. If<br>I told her about it two months ahead it would look as if I hadn't<br>anything to hide.<br><br>But of course she'd find out sooner or later. Trust Hilda! She'd<br>start off by pretending to believe it, and then, in that quiet,<br>obstinate way she has, she'd nose out the fact that I'd never been<br>to Nottingham or Derby or Bristol or wherever it might be. It's<br>astonishing how she does it. Such perseverance! She lies low<br>till she's found out all the weak points in your alibi, and then<br>suddenly, when you've put your foot in it by some careless remark,<br>she starts on you. Suddenly comes out with the whole dossier of<br>the case. 'Where did you spend Saturday night? That's a lie!<br>You've been off with a woman. Look at these hairs I found when<br>I was brushing your waistcoat. Look at them! Is my hair that<br>colour?' And then the fun begins. Lord knows how many times it's<br>happened. Sometimes she's been right about the woman and sometimes<br>she's been wrong, but the after-effects are always the same.<br>Nagging for weeks on end! Never a meal without a row--and the kids<br>can't make out what it's all about. The one completely hopeless<br>thing would be to tell her just where I'd spent that week, and why.<br>If I explained till the Day of Judgment she'd never believe that.<br><br>But, hell! I thought, why bother? It was a long way off. You<br>know how different these things seem before and after. I shoved my<br>foot down on the accelerator again. I'd had another idea, almost<br>bigger than the first. I wouldn't go in May. I'd go in the second<br>half of June, when the coarse-fishing season had started, and I'd<br>go fishing!<br><br>Why not, after all? I wanted peace, and fishing is peace. And<br>then the biggest idea of all came into my head and very nearly made<br>me swing the car off the road.<br><br>I'd go and catch those big carp in the pool at Binfield House!<br><br>And once again, why not? Isn't it queer how we go through life,<br>always thinking that the things we want to do are the things that<br>can't be done? Why shouldn't I catch those carp? And yet, as soon<br>as the idea's mentioned, doesn't it sound to you like something<br>impossible, something that just couldn't happen? It seemed so to<br>me, even at that moment. It seemed to me a kind of dope-dream,<br>like the ones you have of sleeping with film stars or winning the<br>heavyweight championship. And yet it wasn't in the least<br>impossible, it wasn't even improbable. Fishing can be rented.<br>Whoever owned Binfield House now would probably let the pool if<br>they got enough for it. And Gosh! I'd be glad to pay five pounds<br>for a day's fishing in that pool. For that matter it was quite<br>likely that the house was still empty and nobody even knew that the<br>pool existed.<br><br>I thought of it in the dark place among the trees, waiting for me<br>all those years. And the huge black fish still gliding round it.<br>Jesus! If they were that size thirty years ago, what would they be<br>like now?<br><br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/14.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/16.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
