<h2>Part 4, Chapter 2</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The dining-room had changed, too.<br><br>I could remember the old room, though I'd never had a meal there,<br>with its brown mantelpiece and its bronzy-yellow wallpaper--I never<br>knew whether it was meant to be that colour, or had just got like<br>that from age and smoke--and the oil-painting, also by Wm.<br>Sandford, Painter & Carpenter, of the battle of Tel-el-Kebir.<br>Now they'd got the place up in a kind of medieval style. Brick<br>fireplace with inglenooks, a huge beam across the ceiling, oak<br>panelling on the walls, and every bit of it a fake that you could<br>have spotted fifty yards away. The beam was genuine oak, came out<br>of some old sailing-ship, probably, but it didn't hold anything up,<br>and I had my suspicions of the panels as soon as I set eyes on<br>them. As I sat down at my table, and the slick young waiter came<br>towards me fiddling with his napkin, I tapped the wall behind me.<br>Yes! Thought so! Not even wood. They fake it up with some kind<br>of composition and then paint it over.<br><br>But the lunch wasn't bad. I had my lamb and mint sauce, and I had<br>a bottle of some white wine or other with a French name which made<br>me belch a bit but made me feel happy. There was one other person<br>lunching there, a woman of about thirty with fair hair, looked like<br>a widow. I wondered whether she was staying at the George, and<br>made vague plans to get off with her. It's funny how your feelings<br>get mixed up. Half the time I was seeing ghosts. The past was<br>sticking out into the present, Market day, and the great solid<br>farmers throwing their legs under the long table, with their<br>hobnails grating on the stone floor, and working their way through<br>a quantity of beef and dumpling you wouldn't believe the human<br>frame could hold. And then the little tables with their shiny<br>white cloths and wine-glasses and folded napkins, and the faked-up<br>decorations and the general expensiveness would blot it out again.<br>And I'd think, 'I've got twelve quid and a new suit. I'm little<br>Georgie Bowling, and who'd have believed I'd ever come back to<br>Lower Binfield in my own motorcar?' And then the wine would send a<br>kind of warm feeling upwards from my stomach, and I'd run an eye<br>over the woman with fair hair and mentally take her clothes off.<br><br>It was the same in the afternoon as I lay about in the lounge--<br>fake-medieval again, but it had streamlined leather armchairs and<br>glass-topped tables--with some brandy and a cigar. I was seeing<br>ghosts, but on the whole I was enjoying it. As a matter of fact<br>I was a tiny bit boozed and hoping that the woman with fair hair<br>would come in so that I could scrape acquaintance. She never<br>showed up, however. It wasn't till nearly tea-time that I went<br>out.<br><br>I strolled up to the market-place and turned to the left. The<br>shop! It was funny. Twenty-one years ago, the day of Mother's<br>funeral, I'd passed it in the station fly, and seen it all shut up<br>and dusty, with the sign burnt off with a plumber's blowflame, and<br>I hadn't cared a damn. And now, when I was so much further away<br>from it, when there were actually details about the inside of the<br>house that I couldn't remember, the thought of seeing it again did<br>things to my heart and guts. I passed the barber's shop. Still a<br>barber's, though the name was different. A warm, soapy, almondy<br>smell came out of the door. Not quite so good as the old smell of<br>bay rum and latakia. The shop--our shop--was twenty yards farther<br>down. Ah!<br><br>An arty-looking sign--painted by the same chap as did the one at<br>the George, I shouldn't wonder--hanging out over the pavement:<br><br><br>WENDY'S TEASHOP<br><br>MORNING COFFEE<br><br>HOME-MADE CAKES<br><br><br>A tea-shop!<br><br>I suppose if it had been a butcher's or an ironmonger's, or<br>anything else except a seedsman's, it would have given me the same<br>kind of jolt. It's absurd that because you happen to have been<br>born in a certain house you should feel that you've got rights over<br>it for the rest of your life, but so you do. The place lived up to<br>its name, all right. Blue curtains in the window, and a cake or<br>two standing about, the kind of cake that's covered with chocolate<br>and has just one walnut stuck somewhere on the top. I went in.<br>I didn't really want any tea, but I had to see the inside.<br><br>They'd evidently turned both the shop and what used to be the<br>parlour into tea-rooms. As for the yard at the back where the<br>dustbin used to stand and Father's little patch of weeds used to<br>grow, they'd paved it all over and dolled it up with rustic tables<br>and hydrangeas and things. I went through into the parlour. More<br>ghosts! The piano and the texts on the wall, and the two lumpy old<br>red armchairs where Father and Mother used to sit on opposite sides<br>of the fireplace, reading the People and the News of the World on<br>Sunday afternoons! They'd got the place up in an even more antique<br>style than the George, with gateleg tables and a hammered-iron<br>chandelier and pewter plates hanging on the wall and what-not. Do<br>you notice how dark they always manage to make it in these arty<br>tea-rooms? It's part of the antiqueness, I suppose. And instead<br>of an ordinary waitress there was a young woman in a kind of print<br>wrapper who met me with a sour expression. I asked her for tea,<br>and she was ten minutes getting it. You know the kind of tea--<br>China tea, so weak that you could think it's water till you put the<br>milk in. I was sitting almost exactly where Father's armchair used<br>to stand. I could almost hear his voice, reading out a 'piece', as<br>he used to call it, from the People, about the new flying machines,<br>or the chap who was swallowed by a whale, or something. It gave me<br>a most peculiar feeling that I was there on false pretences and<br>they could kick me out if they discovered who I was, and yet<br>simultaneously I had a kind of longing to tell somebody that I'd<br>been born here, that I belonged to this house, or rather (what I<br>really felt) that the house belonged to me. There was nobody else<br>having tea. The girl in the print wrapper was hanging about by the<br>window, and I could see that if I hadn't been there she'd have been<br>picking her teeth. I bit into one of the slices of cake she'd<br>brought me. Home-made cakes! You bet they were. Home-made with<br>margarine and egg-substitute. But in the end I had to speak.<br>I said:<br><br>'Have you been in Lower Binfield long?'<br><br>She started, looked surprised, and didn't answer. I tried again:<br><br>'I used to live in Lower Binfleld myself, a good while ago.'<br><br>Again no answer, or only something that I couldn't hear. She gave<br>me a kind of frigid look and then gazed out of the window again. I<br>saw how it was. Too much of a lady to go in for back-chat with<br>customers. Besides, she probably thought I was trying to get off<br>with her. What was the good of telling her I'd been born in the<br>house? Even if she believed it, it wouldn't interest her. She'd<br>never heard of Samuel Bowling, Corn & Seed Merchant. I paid the<br>bill and cleared out.<br><br>I wandered up to the church. One thing that I'd been half afraid<br>of, and half looking forward to, was being recognized by people I<br>used to know. But I needn't have worried, there wasn't a face I<br>knew anywhere in the streets. It seemed as if the whole town had<br>got a new population.<br><br>When I got to the church I saw why they'd had to have a new<br>cemetery. The churchyard was full to the brim, and half the graves<br>had names on them that I didn't know. But the names I did know<br>were easy enough to find. I wandered round among the graves. The<br>sexton had just scythed the grass and there was a smell of summer<br>even there. They were all alone, all the older folks I'd known.<br>Gravitt the butcher, and Winkle the other seedsman, and Trew, who<br>used to keep the George, and Mrs Wheeler from the sweet-shop--they<br>were all lying there. Shooter and Wetherall were opposite one<br>another on either side of the path, just as if they were still<br>singing at each other across the aisle. So Wetherall hadn't got<br>his hundred after all. Born in '43 and 'departed his life' in<br>1928. But he'd beaten Shooter, as usual. Shooter died in '26.<br>What a time old Wetherall must have had those last two years when<br>there was nobody to sing against him! And old Grimmett under a<br>huge marble thing shaped rather like a veal-and-ham pie, with an<br>iron railing round it, and in the corner a whole batch of Simmonses<br>under cheap little crosses. All gone to dust. Old Hodges with his<br>tobacco-coloured teeth, and Lovegrove with his big brown beard, and<br>Lady Rampling with the coachman and the tiger, and Harry Barnes's<br>aunt who had a glass eye, and Brewer of the Mill Farm with his<br>wicked old face like something carved out of a nut--nothing left of<br>any of them except a slab of stone and God knows what underneath.<br><br>I found Mother's grave, and Father's beside it. Both of them in<br>pretty good repair. The sexton had kept the grass clipped. Uncle<br>Ezekiel's was a little way away. They'd levelled a lot of the<br>older graves, and the old wooden head-pieces, the ones that used to<br>look like the end of a bedstead, had all been cleared away. What<br>do you feel when you see your parents' graves after twenty years?<br>I don't know what you ought to feel, but I'll tell you what I did<br>feel, and that was nothing. Father and Mother have never faded out<br>of my mind. It's as if they existed somewhere or other in a kind<br>of eternity, Mother behind the brown teapot, Father with his bald<br>head a little mealy, and his spectacles and his grey moustache,<br>fixed for ever like people in a picture, and yet in some way alive.<br>Those boxes of bones lying in the ground there didn't seem to have<br>anything to do with them. Merely, as I stood there, I began to<br>wonder what you feel like when you're underground, whether you care<br>much and how soon you cease to care, when suddenly a heavy shadow<br>swept across me and gave me a bit of a start.<br><br>I looked over my shoulder. It was only a bombing plane which had<br>flown between me and the sun. The place seemed to be creeping with<br>them.<br><br>I strolled into the church. For almost the first time since I got<br>back to Lower Binfield I didn't have the ghostly feeling, or rather<br>I had it in a different form. Because nothing had changed.<br>Nothing, except that all the people were gone. Even the hassocks<br>looked the same. The same dusty, sweetish corpse-smell. And by<br>God! the same hole in the window, though, as it was evening and the<br>sun was round the other side, the spot of light wasn't creeping up<br>the aisle. They'd still got pews--hadn't changed over to chairs.<br>There was our pew, and there was the one in front where Wetherall<br>used to bellow against Shooter. Sihon king of the Amorites and Og<br>the king of Bashan! And the worn stones in the aisle where you<br>could still half-read the epitaphs of the blokes who lay beneath<br>them. I squatted down to have a look at the one opposite our pew.<br>I still knew the readable bits of it by heart. Even the pattern<br>they made seemed to have stuck in my memory. Lord knows how often<br>I'd read them during the sermon.<br><br><br>Here..................fon, Gent.,<br>of this parif h..........his juft &<br>upright..........................<br>..................................<br>To his........manifold private bene<br>volences he added a diligent.......<br>...................................<br>.......................beloved wife<br>Amelia, by..............iffue feven<br>daughters..........................<br><br><br>I remembered how the long S's used to puzzle me as a kid. Used to<br>wonder whether in the old days they pronounced their S's as F's,<br>and if so, why.<br><br>There was a step behind me. I looked up. A chap in a cassock was<br>standing over me. It was the vicar.<br><br>But I mean THE vicar! It was old Betterton, who'd been vicar in<br>the old days--not, as a matter of fact, ever since I could<br>remember, but since 1904 or thereabouts. I recognized him at once,<br>though his hair was quite white.<br><br>He didn't recognize me. I was only a fat tripper in a blue suit<br>doing a bit of sightseeing. He said good evening and promptly<br>started on the usual line of talk--was I interested in architecture,<br>remarkable old building this, foundations go back to Saxon times and<br>so on and so forth. And soon he was doddering round, showing me the<br>sights, such as they were--Norman arch leading into the vestry,<br>brass effigy of Sir Roderick Bone who was killed at the Battle of<br>Newbury. And I followed him with the kind of whipped-dog air that<br>middle-aged businessmen always have when they're being shown round a<br>church or a picture-gallery. But did I tell him that I knew it all<br>already? Did I tell him that I was Georgie Bowling, son of Samuel<br>Bowling--he'd have remembered my father even if he didn't remember<br>me--and that I'd not only listened to his sermons for ten years and<br>gone to his Confirmation classes, but even belonged to the Lower<br>Binfield Reading Circle and had a go at Sesame and Lilies just to<br>please him? No, I didn't. I merely followed him round, making the<br>kind of mumble that you make when somebody tells you that this or<br>that is five hundred years old and you can't think what the hell to<br>say except that it doesn't look it. From the moment that I set eyes<br>on him I'd decided to let him think I was a stranger. As soon as I<br>decently could I dropped sixpence in the Church Expenses box and<br>bunked.<br><br>But why? Why not make contact, now that at last I'd found somebody<br>I knew?<br><br>Because the change in his appearance after twenty years had<br>actually frightened me. I suppose you think I mean that he looked<br>older. But he didn't! He looked YOUNGER. And it suddenly taught<br>me something about the passage of time.<br><br>I suppose old Betterton would be about sixty-five now, so that when<br>I last saw him he'd have been about forty-five--my own present age.<br>His hair was white now, and the day he buried Mother it was a kind<br>of streaky grey, like a shaving-brush. And yet as soon as I saw<br>him the first thing that struck me was that he looked younger. I'd<br>thought of him as an old, old man, and after all he wasn't so very<br>old. As a boy, it occurred to me, all people over forty had seemed<br>to me just worn-out old wrecks, so old that there was hardly any<br>difference between them. A man of forty-five had seemed to me<br>older than this old dodderer of sixty-five seemed now. And Christ!<br>I was forty-five myself. It frightened me.<br><br>So that's what I look like to chaps of twenty, I thought as I made<br>off between the graves. Just a poor old hulk. Finished. It was<br>curious. As a rule I don't care a damn about my age. Why should<br>I? I'm fat, but I'm strong and healthy. I can do everything I<br>want to do. A rose smells the same to me now as it did when I was<br>twenty. Ah, but do I smell the same to the rose? Like an answer a<br>girl, might have been eighteen, came up the churchyard lane. She<br>had to pass within a yard or two of me. I saw the look she gave<br>me, just a tiny momentary look. No, not frightened, nor hostile.<br>Only kind of wild, remote, like a wild animal when you catch its<br>eye. She'd been born and grown up in those twenty years while I<br>was away from Lower Binfield. All my memories would have been<br>meaningless to her. Living in a different world from me, like an<br>animal.<br><br>I went back to the George. I wanted a drink, but the bar didn't<br>open for another half-hour. I hung about for a bit, reading a<br>Sporting and Dramatic of the year before, and presently the fair-<br>haired dame, the one I thought might be a widow, came in. I had a<br>sudden desperate yearning to get off with her. Wanted to show<br>myself that there's life in the old dog yet, even if the old dog<br>does have to wear false teeth. After all, I thought, if she's<br>thirty and I'm forty-five, that's fair enough. I was standing in<br>front of the empty fireplace, making believe to warm my bum, the<br>way you do on a summer day. In my blue suit I didn't look so bad.<br>A bit fat, no doubt, but distingue. A man of the world. I could<br>pass for a stockbroker. I put on my toniest accent and said<br>casually:<br><br>'Wonderful June weather we're having.'<br><br>It was a pretty harmless remark, wasn't it? Nor in the same class<br>as 'Haven't I met you somewhere before?'<br><br>But it wasn't a success. She didn't answer, merely lowered for<br>about half a second the paper she was reading and gave me a look<br>that would have cracked a window. It was awful. She had one of<br>those blue eyes that go into you like a bullet. In that split<br>second I saw how hopelessly I'd got her wrong. She wasn't the kind<br>of widow with dyed hair who likes being taken out to dance-halls.<br>She was upper-middle-class, probably an admiral's daughter, and<br>been to one of those good schools where they play hockey. And I'd<br>got myself wrong too. New suit or no new suit, I COULDN'T pass for<br>a stockbroker. Merely looked like a commercial traveller who'd<br>happened to get hold of a bit of dough. I sneaked off to the<br>private bar to have a pint or two before dinner.<br><br>The beer wasn't the same. I remember the old beer, the good Thames<br>Valley beer that used to have a bit of taste in it because it was<br>made out of chalky water. I asked the barmaid:<br><br>'Have Bessemers' still got the brewery?'<br><br>'Bessemers? Oo, NO, sir! They've gorn. Oo, years ago--long<br>before we come 'ere.'<br><br>She was a friendly sort, what I call the elder-sister type of<br>barmaid, thirty-fivish, with a mild kind of face and the fat arms<br>they develop from working the beer-handle. She told me the name of<br>the combine that had taken over the brewery. I could have guessed<br>it from the taste, as a matter of fact. The different bars ran<br>round in a circle with compartments in between. Across in the<br>public bar two chaps were playing a game of darts, and in the Jug<br>and Bottle there was a chap I couldn't see who occasionally put in<br>a remark in a sepulchral kind of voice. The barmaid leaned her fat<br>elbows on the bar and had a talk with me. I ran over the names of<br>the people I used to know, and there wasn't a single one of them<br>that she'd heard of. She said she'd only been in Lower Binfield<br>five years. She hadn't even heard of old Trew, who used to have<br>the George in the old days.<br><br>'I used to live in Lower Binfield myself,' I told her. 'A good<br>while back, it was, before the war.'<br><br>'Before the war? Well, now! You don't look that old.'<br><br>'See some changes, I dessay,' said the chap in the Jug and Bottle.<br><br>'The town's grown,' I said. 'It's the factories, I suppose.'<br><br>'Well, of course they mostly work at the factories. There's the<br>gramophone works, and then there's Truefitt Stockings. But of<br>course they're making bombs nowadays.'<br><br>I didn't altogether see why it was of course, but she began telling<br>me about a young fellow who worked at Truefitt's factory and<br>sometimes came to the George, and he'd told her that they were<br>making bombs as well as stockings, the two, for some reason I<br>didn't understand, being easy to combine. And then she told me<br>about the big military aerodrome near Walton--that accounted for<br>the bombing planes I kept seeing--and the next moment we'd started<br>talking about the war, as usual. Funny. It was exactly to escape<br>the thought of war that I'd come here. But how can you, anyway?<br>It's in the air you breathe.<br><br>I said it was coming in 1941. The chap in the Jug and Bottle said<br>he reckoned it was a bad job. The barmaid said it gave her the<br>creeps. She said:<br><br>'It doesn't seem to do much good, does it, after all said and done?<br>And sometimes I lie awake at night and hear one of those great<br>things going overhead, and think to myself, "Well, now, suppose<br>that was to drop a bomb right down on top of me!" And all this<br>A.R.P., and Miss Todgers, she's the Air Warden, telling you it'll<br>be all right if you keep your head and stuff the windows up with<br>newspaper, and they say they're going to dig a shelter under the<br>Town Hall. But the way I look at it is, how could you put a gas-<br>mask on a baby?'<br><br>The chap in the Jug and Bottle said he'd read in the paper that you<br>ought to get into a hot bath till it was all over. The chaps in<br>the public bar overheard this and there was a bit of a by-play on<br>the subject of how many people could get into the same bath, and<br>both of them asked the barmaid if they could share her bath with<br>her. She told them not to get saucy, and then she went up the<br>other end of the bar and hauled them out a couple more pints of old<br>and mild. I took a suck at my beer. It was poor stuff. Bitter,<br>they call it. And it was bitter, right enough, too bitter, a kind<br>of sulphurous taste. Chemicals. They say no English hops ever go<br>into beer nowadays, they're all made into chemicals. Chemicals, on<br>the other hand, are made into beer. I found myself thinking about<br>Uncle Ezekiel, what he'd have said to beer like this, and what he'd<br>have said about A.R.P. and the buckets of sand you're supposed to<br>put the thermite bombs out with. As the barmaid came back to my<br>side of the bar I said:<br><br>'By the way, who's got the Hall nowadays?'<br><br>We always used to call it the Hall, though its name was Binfield<br>House. For a moment she didn't seem to understand.<br><br>'The Hall, sir?'<br><br>''E means Binfield 'Ouse,' said the chap in the Jug and Bottle.<br><br>'Oh, Binfield House! Oo, I thought you meant the Memorial Hall.<br>It's Dr Merrall's got Binfield House now.'<br><br>'Dr Merrall?'<br><br>'Yes, sir. He's got more than sixty patients up there, they say.'<br><br>'Patients? Have they turned it into a hospital, or something?'<br><br>'Well--it's not what you'd call an ordinary hospital. More of a<br>sanatorium. It's mental patients, reely. What they call a Mental<br>Home.'<br><br>A loony-bin!<br><br>But after all, what else could you expect?<br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/17.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/19.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
