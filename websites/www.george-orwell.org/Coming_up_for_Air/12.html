<h2>Part 2, Chapter 9</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The war had jerked me out of the old life I'd known, but in the<br>queer period that came afterwards I forgot it almost completely.<br><br>I know that in a sense one never forgets anything. You remember<br>that piece of orange-peel you saw in the gutter thirteen years ago,<br>and that coloured poster of Torquay that you once got a glimpse of<br>in a railway waiting-room. But I'm speaking of a different kind of<br>memory. In a sense I remembered the old life in Lower Binfield.<br>I remembered my fishing-rod and the smell of sainfoin and Mother<br>behind the brown teapot and Jackie the bullfinch and the horse-<br>trough in the market-place. But none of it was alive in my mind<br>any longer. It was something far away, something that I'd finished<br>with. It would never have occurred to me that some day I might<br>want to go back to it.<br><br>It was a queer time, those years just after the war, almost queerer<br>than the war itself, though people don't remember it so vividly.<br>In a rather different form the sense of disbelieving in everything<br>was stronger than ever. Millions of men had suddenly been kicked<br>out of the Army to find that the country they'd fought for didn't<br>want them, and Lloyd George and his pals were giving the works to<br>any illusions that still existed. Bands of ex-service men marched<br>up and down rattling collection boxes, masked women were singing in<br>the streets, and chaps in officers' tunics were grinding barrel-<br>organs. Everybody in England seemed to be scrambling for jobs,<br>myself included. But I came off luckier than most. I got a small<br>wound-gratuity, and what with that and the bit of money I'd put<br>aside during the last year of war (not having had much opportunity<br>to spend it), I came out of the Army with no less than three<br>hundred and fifty quid. It's rather interesting, I think, to<br>notice my reaction. Here I was, with quite enough money to do the<br>thing I'd been brought up to do and the thing I'd dreamed of for<br>years--that is, start a shop. I had plenty of capital. If you<br>bide your time and keep your eyes open you can run across quite<br>nice little businesses for three hundred and fifty quid. And yet,<br>if you'll believe me, the idea never occurred to me. I not only<br>didn't make any move towards starting a shop, but it wasn't till<br>years later, about 1925 in fact, that it even crossed my mind that<br>I might have done so. The fact was that I'd passed right out of<br>the shopkeeping orbit. That was what the Army did to you. It<br>turned you into an imitation gentleman and gave you a fixed idea<br>that there'd always be a bit of money coming from somewhere. If<br>you'd suggested to me then, in 1919, that I ought to start a shop--<br>a tobacco and sweet shop, say, or a general store in some god-<br>forsaken village--I'd just have laughed. I'd worn pips on my<br>shoulder, and my social standards had risen. At the same time I<br>didn't share the delusion, which was pretty common among ex-<br>officers, that I could spend the rest of my life drinking pink gin.<br>I knew I'd got to have a job. And the job, of course, would be 'in<br>business'--just what kind of job I didn't know, but something high-<br>up and important, something with a car and a telephone and if<br>possible a secretary with a permanent wave. During the last year<br>or so of war a lot of us had had visions like that. The chap who'd<br>been a shop walker saw himself as a travelling salesman, and the<br>chap who'd been a travelling salesman saw himself as a managing<br>director. It was the effect of Army life, the effect of wearing<br>pips and having a cheque-book and calling the evening meal dinner.<br>All the while there'd been an idea floating round--and this applied<br>to the men in the ranks as well as the officers--that when we came<br>out of the Army there'd be jobs waiting for us that would bring in<br>at least as much as our Army pay. Of course, if ideas like that<br>didn't circulate, no war would ever be fought.<br><br>Well, I didn't get that job. It seemed that nobody was anxious to<br>pay me 2,000 pounds a year for sitting among streamlined office<br>furniture and dictating letters to a platinum blonde. I was<br>discovering what three-quarters of the blokes who'd been officers<br>were discovering--that from a financial point of view we'd been<br>better off in the Army than we were ever likely to be again. We'd<br>suddenly changed from gentlemen holding His Majesty's commission<br>into miserable out-of-works whom nobody wanted. My ideas soon sank<br>from two thousand a year to three or four pounds a week. But even<br>jobs of the three or four pounds a week kind didn't seem to exist.<br>Every mortal job was filled already, either by men who'd been a few<br>years too old to fight, or by boys who'd been a few months too<br>young. The poor bastards who'd happened to be born between 1890<br>and 1900 were left out in the cold. And still it never occurred to<br>me to go back to the grocering business. Probably I could have got<br>a job as a grocer's assistant; old Grimmett, if he was still alive<br>and in business (I wasn't in touch with Lower Binfield and didn't<br>know), would have given me good refs. But I'd passed into a<br>different orbit. Even if my social ideas hadn't risen, I could<br>hardly have imagined, after what I'd seen and learned, going back<br>to the old safe existence behind the counter. I wanted to be<br>travelling about and pulling down the big dough. Chiefly I wanted<br>to be a travelling salesman, which I knew would suit me.<br><br>But there were no jobs for travelling salesmen--that's to say, jobs<br>with a salary attached. What there were, however, were on-<br>commission jobs. That racket was just beginning on a big, scale.<br>It's a beautifully simple method of increasing your sales and<br>advertising your stuff without taking any risks, and it always<br>flourishes when times are bad. They keep you on a string by<br>hinting that perhaps there'll be a salaried job going in three<br>months' time, and when you get fed up there's always some other<br>poor devil ready to take over. Naturally it wasn't long before I<br>had an on-commission job, in fact I had quite a number in rapid<br>succession. Thank God, I never came down to peddling vacuum-<br>cleaners, or dictionaries. But I travelled in cutlery, in soap-<br>powder, in a line of patent corkscrews, tin-openers, and similar<br>gadgets, and finally in a line of office accessories--paper-clips,<br>carbon paper, typewriter ribbons, and so forth. I didn't do so<br>badly either. I'm the type that CAN sell things on commission.<br>I've got the temperament and I've got the manner. But I never came<br>anywhere near making a decent living. You can't, in jobs like<br>that--and, of course, you aren't meant to.<br><br>I had about a year of it altogether. It was a queer time. The<br>cross-country journeys, the godless places you fetched up in,<br>suburbs of Midland towns that you'd never hear of in a hundred<br>normal lifetimes. The ghastly bed-and-breakfast houses where the<br>sheets always smell faintly of slops and the fried egg at breakfast<br>has a yolk paler than a lemon. And the other poor devils of<br>salesmen that you're always meeting, middle-aged fathers of<br>families in moth-eaten overcoats and bowler hats, who honestly<br>believe that sooner or later trade will turn the corner and they'll<br>jack their earnings up to five quid a week. And the traipsing from<br>shop to shop, and the arguments with shopkeepers who don't want to<br>listen, and the standing back and making yourself small when a<br>customer comes in. Don't think that it worried me particularly.<br>To some chaps that kind of life is torture. There are chaps who<br>can't even walk into a shop and open their bag of samples without<br>screwing themselves up as though they were going over the top. But<br>I'm not like that. I'm tough, I can talk people into buying things<br>they don't want, and even if they slam the door in my face it<br>doesn't bother me. Selling things on commission is actually what I<br>like doing, provided I can see my way to making a bit of dough out<br>of it. I don't know whether I learned much in that year, but I<br>unlearned a good deal. It knocked the Army nonsense out of me, and<br>it drove into the back of my head the notions that I'd picked up<br>during the idle year when I was reading novels. I don't think I<br>read a single book, barring detective stories, all the time I was<br>on the road. I wasn't a highbrow any longer. I was down among the<br>realities of modern life. And what are the realities of modern<br>life? Well, the chief one is an everlasting, frantic struggle to<br>sell things. With most people it takes the form of selling<br>themselves--that's to say, getting a job and keeping it. I suppose<br>there hasn't been a single month since the war, in any trade you<br>care to name, in which there weren't more men than jobs. It's<br>brought a peculiar, ghastly feeling into life. It's like on a<br>sinking ship when there are nineteen survivors and fourteen<br>lifebelts. But is there anything particularly modern in that, you<br>say? Has it anything to do with the war? Well, it feels as if it<br>had. That feeling that you've got to be everlastingly fighting and<br>hustling, that you'll never get anything unless you grab it from<br>somebody else, that there's always somebody after your job, the<br>next month or the month after they'll be reducing staff and it's<br>you that'll get the bird--THAT, I swear, didn't exist in the old<br>life before the war.<br><br>But meanwhile I wasn't badly off. I was earning a bit and I'd<br>still got plenty of money in the bank, nearly two hundred quid, and<br>I wasn't frightened for the future. I knew that sooner or later<br>I'd get a regular job. And sure enough, after about a year, by a<br>stroke of luck it happened. I say by a stroke of luck, but the<br>fact is that I was bound to fall on my feet. I'm not the type that<br>starves. I'm about as likely to end up in the workhouse as to end<br>up in the House of Lords. I'm the middling type, the type that<br>gravitates by a kind of natural law towards the five-pound-a-week<br>level. So long as there are any jobs at all I'll back myself to<br>get one.<br><br>It happened when I was peddling paper-clips and typewriter ribbons.<br>I'd just dodged into a huge block of offices in Fleet Street, a<br>building which canvassers weren't allowed into, as a matter of<br>fact, but I'd managed to give the lift attendant the impression<br>that my bag of samples was merely an attache case. I was walking<br>along one of the corridors looking for the offices of a small<br>toothpaste firm that I'd been recommended to try, when I saw that<br>some very big bug was coming down the corridor in the other<br>direction. I knew immediately that it was a big bug. You know how<br>it is with these big business men, they seem to take up more room<br>and walk more loudly than any ordinary person, and they give off a<br>kind of wave of money that you can feel fifty yards away. When he<br>got nearly up to me I saw that it was Sir Joseph Cheam. He was in<br>civvies, of course, but I had no difficulty in recognizing him. I<br>suppose he'd been there for some business conference or other. A<br>couple of clerks, or secretaries, or something, were following<br>after him, not actually holding up his train, because he wasn't<br>wearing one, but you somehow felt that that was what they were<br>doing. Of course I dodged aside instantly. But curiously enough<br>he recognized me, though he hadn't seen me for years. To my<br>surprise he stopped and spoke to me.<br><br>'Hullo, you! I've seen you somewhere before. What's your name?<br>It's on the tip of my tongue.'<br><br>'Bowling, sir. Used to be in the A.S.C.'<br><br>'Of course. The boy that said he wasn't a gentleman. What are you<br>doing here?'<br><br>I might have told him I was selling typewriter ribbons, and there<br>perhaps the whole thing would have ended. But I had one of those<br>sudden inspirations that you get occasionally--a feeling that I<br>might make something out of this if I handled it properly. I said<br>instead:<br><br>'Well, sir, as a matter of fact I'm looking for a job.'<br><br>'A job, eh? Hm. Not so easy, nowadays.'<br><br>He looked me up and down for a second. The two train-bearers had<br>kind of wafted themselves a little distance away. I saw his rather<br>good-looking old face, with the heavy grey eyebrows and the<br>intelligent nose, looking me over and realized that he'd decided to<br>help me. It's queer, the power of these rich men. He'd been<br>marching past me in his power and glory, with his underlings after<br>him, and then on some whim or other he'd turned aside like an<br>emperor suddenly chucking a coin to a beggar.<br><br>'So you want a job? What can you do?'<br><br>Again the inspiration. No use, with a bloke like this, cracking up<br>your own merits. Stick to the truth. I said: 'Nothing, sir. But<br>I want a job as a travelling salesman.'<br><br>'Salesman? Hm. Not sure that I've got anything for you at<br>present. Let's see.'<br><br>He pursed his lips up. For a moment, half a minute perhaps, he<br>was thinking quite deeply. It was curious. Even at the time I<br>realized that it was curious. This important old bloke, who was<br>probably worth at least half a million, was actually taking thought<br>on my behalf. I'd deflected him from his path and wasted at least<br>three minutes of his time, all because of a chance remark I'd<br>happened to make years earlier. I'd stuck in his memory and<br>therefore he was willing to take the tiny bit of trouble that was<br>needed to find me a job. I dare say the same day he gave twenty<br>clerks the sack. Finally he said:<br><br>'How'd you like to go into an insurance firm? Always fairly safe,<br>you know. People have got to have insurance, same as they've got<br>to eat.'<br><br>Of course I jumped at the idea of going into an insurance firm.<br>Sir Joseph was 'interested' in the Flying Salamander. God knows<br>how many companies he was 'interested' in. One of the underlings<br>wafted himself forward with a scribbling-pad, and there and then,<br>with the gold stylo out of his waistcoat pocket, Sir Joseph<br>scribbled me a note to some higher-up in the Flying Salamander.<br>Then I thanked him, and he marched on, and I sneaked off in the<br>other direction, and we never saw one another again.<br><br>Well, I got the job, and, as I said earlier, the job got me. I've<br>been with the Flying Salamander close on eighteen years. I started<br>off in the office, but now I'm what's known as an Inspector,<br>or, when there's reason to sound particularly impressive, a<br>Representative. A couple of days a week I'm working in the<br>district office, and the rest of the time I'm travelling around,<br>interviewing clients whose names have been sent in by the local<br>agents, making assessments of shops and other property, and now and<br>again snapping up a few orders on my own account. I earn round<br>about seven quid a week. And properly speaking that's the end of<br>my story.<br><br>When I look back I realize that my active life, if I ever had one,<br>ended when I was sixteen. Everything that really matters to me had<br>happened before that date. But in a manner of speaking things were<br>still happening--the war, for instance--up to the time when I got<br>the job with the Flying Salamander. After that--well, they say<br>that happy people have no histories, and neither do the blokes who<br>work in insurance offices. From that day forward there was nothing<br>in my life that you could properly describe as an event, except<br>that about two and a half years later, at the beginning of '23, I<br>got married. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/11.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/13.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
