<h2>Part 2, Chapter 2</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Thursday was market day. Chaps with round red faces like pumpkins<br>and dirty smocks and huge boots covered with dry cow-dung, carrying<br>long hazel switches, used to drive their brutes into the market-<br>place early in the morning. For hours there'd be a terrific<br>hullabaloo: dogs barking, pigs squealing, chaps in tradesmen's vans<br>who wanted to get through the crush cracking their whips and<br>cursing, and everyone who had anything to do with the cattle<br>shouting and throwing sticks. The big noise was always when they<br>brought a bull to market. Even at that age it struck me that most<br>of the bulls were harmless law-abiding brutes that only wanted to<br>get to their stalls in peace, but a bull wouldn't have been<br>regarded as a bull if half the town hadn't had to turn out and<br>chase it. Sometimes some terrified brute, generally a half-grown<br>heifer, used to break loose and charge down a side street, and then<br>anyone who happened to be in the way would stand in the middle of<br>the road and swing his arms backwards like the sails of a windmill,<br>shouting, 'Woo! Woo!' This was supposed to have a kind of hypnotic<br>effect on an animal and certainly it did frighten them.<br><br>Half-way through the morning some of the farmers would come into<br>the shop and run samples of seed through their fingers. Actually<br>Father did very little business with the farmers, because he had no<br>delivery van and couldn't afford to give long credits. Mostly he<br>did a rather petty class of business, poultry food and fodder for<br>the tradesmen's horses and so forth. Old Brewer, of the Mill Farm,<br>who was a stingy old bastard with a grey chin-beard, used to stand<br>there for half an hour, fingering samples of chicken corn and<br>letting them drop into his pocket in an absent-minded manner, after<br>which, of course, he finally used to make off without buying<br>anything. In the evenings the pubs were full of drunken men. In<br>those days beer cost twopence a pint, and unlike the beer nowadays<br>it had some guts in it. All through the Boer War the recruiting<br>sergeant used to be in the four-ale bar of the George every<br>Thursday and Saturday night, dressed up to the nines and very free<br>with his money. Sometimes next morning you'd see him leading off<br>some great sheepish, red-faced lump of a farm lad who'd taken the<br>shilling when he was too drunk to see and found in the morning that<br>it would cost him twenty pounds to get out of it. People used to<br>stand in their doorways and shake their heads when they saw them go<br>past, almost as if it had been a funeral. 'Well now! Listed for a<br>soldier! Just think of it! A fine young fellow like that!' It<br>just shocked them. Listing for a soldier, in their eyes, was the<br>exact equivalent of a girl's going on the streets. Their attitude<br>to the war, and to the Army, was very curious. They had the good<br>old English notions that the red-coats are the scum of the earth<br>and anyone who joins the Army will die of drink and go straight to<br>hell, but at the same time they were good patriots, stuck Union<br>Jacks in their windows, and held it as an article of faith that the<br>English had never been beaten in battle and never could be. At<br>that time everyone, even the Nonconformists, used to sing<br>sentimental songs about the thin red line and the soldier boy who<br>died on the battlefield far away. These soldier boys always used<br>to die 'when the shot and shell were flying', I remember. It<br>puzzled me as a kid. Shot I could understand, but it produced a<br>queer picture in my mind to think of cockle-shells flying through<br>the air. When Mafeking was relieved the people nearly yelled the<br>roof off, and there were at any rate times when they believed the<br>tales about the Boers chucking babies into the air and skewering<br>them on their bayonets. Old Brewer got so fed up with the kids<br>yelling 'Krooger!' after him that towards the end of the war he<br>shaved his beard off. The people's attitude towards the Government<br>was really the same. They were all true-blue Englishmen and swore<br>that Vicky was the best queen that ever lived and foreigners were<br>dirt, but at the same time nobody ever thought of paying a tax, not<br>even a dog-licence, if there was any way of dodging it.<br><br>Before and after the war Lower Binfield was a Liberal constituency.<br>During the war there was a by-election which the Conservatives won.<br>I was too young to grasp what it was all about, I only knew that I<br>was a Conservative because I liked the blue streamers better than<br>the red ones, and I chiefly remember it because of a drunken man<br>who fell on his nose on the pavement outside the George. In the<br>general excitement nobody took any notice of him, and he lay there<br>for hours in the hot sun with his blood drying round him, and when<br>it dried it was purple. By the time the 1906 election came along I<br>was old enough to understand it, more or less, and this time I was<br>a Liberal because everybody else was. The people chased the<br>Conservative candidate half a mile and threw him into a pond full<br>of duckweed. People took politics seriously in those days. They<br>used to begin storing up rotten eggs weeks before an election.<br><br>Very early in life, when the Boer War broke out, I remember the big<br>row between Father and Uncle Ezekiel. Uncle Ezekiel had a little<br>boot-shop in one of the streets off the High Street, and also did<br>some cobbling. It was a small business and tended to get smaller,<br>which didn't matter greatly because Uncle Ezekiel wasn't married.<br>He was only a half-brother and much older than Father, twenty years<br>older at least, and for the fifteen years or so that I knew him he<br>always looked exactly the same. He was a fine-looking old chap,<br>rather tall, with white hair and the whitest whiskers I ever saw--<br>white as thistledown. He had a way of slapping his leather apron<br>and standing up very straight--a reaction from bending over the<br>last, I suppose--after which he'd bark his opinions straight in<br>your face, ending up with a sort of ghostly cackle. He was a real<br>old nineteenth-century Liberal, the kind that not only used to ask<br>you what Gladstone said in '78 but could tell you the answer, and<br>one of the very few people in Lower Binfield who stuck to the same<br>opinions all through the war. He was always denouncing Joe<br>Chamberlain and some gang of people that he referred to as 'the<br>Park Lane riff-raff'. I can hear him now, having one of his<br>arguments with Father. 'Them and their far-flung Empire! Can't<br>fling it too far for me. He-he-he!' And then Father's voice, a<br>quiet, worried, conscientious kind of voice, coming back at him<br>with the white man's burden and our dooty to the pore blacks whom<br>these here Boars treated something shameful. For a week or so<br>after Uncle Ezekiel gave it out that he was a pro-Boer and a Little<br>Englander they were hardly on speaking terms. They had another row<br>when the atrocity stories started. Father was very worried by the<br>tales he'd heard, and he tackled Uncle Ezekiel about it. Little<br>Englander or no, surely he couldn't think it right for these here<br>Boars to throw babies in the air and catch them on their bayonets,<br>even if they WERE only nigger babies? But Uncle Ezekiel just<br>laughed in his face. Father had got it all wrong! It wasn't the<br>Boars who threw babies in the air, it was the British soldiers!<br>He kept grabbing hold of me--I must have been about five--to<br>illustrate. 'Throw them in the air and skewer them like frogs, I<br>tell you! Same as I might throw this youngster here!' And then<br>he'd swing me up and almost let go of me, and I had a vivid picture<br>of myself flying through the air and landing plonk on the end of a<br>bayonet.<br><br>Father was quite different from Uncle Ezekiel. I don't know much<br>about my grandparents, they were dead before I was born, I only<br>know that my grandfather had been a cobbler and late in life he<br>married the widow of a seedsman, which was how we came to have the<br>shop. It was a job that didn't really suit Father, though he knew<br>the business inside out and was everlastingly working. Except on<br>Sunday and very occasionally on week-day evenings I never remember<br>him without meal on the backs of his hands and in the lines of his<br>face and in what was left of his hair. He'd married when he was in<br>his thirties and must have been nearly forty when I first remember<br>him. He was a small man, a sort of grey, quiet little man, always<br>in shirtsleeves and white apron and always dusty-looking because of<br>the meal. He had a round head, a blunt nose, a rather bushy<br>moustache, spectacles, and butter-coloured hair, the same colour<br>as mine, but he'd lost most of it and it was always mealy. My<br>grandfather had bettered himself a good deal by marrying the<br>seedsman's widow, and Father had been educated at Walton Grammar<br>School, where the farmers and the better-off tradesmen sent their<br>sons, whereas Uncle Ezekiel liked to boast that he'd never been to<br>school in his life and had taught himself to read by a tallow<br>candle after working hours. But he was a much quicker-witted man<br>than Father, he could argue with anybody, and he used to quote<br>Carlyle and Spencer by the yard. Father had a slow sort of mind,<br>he'd never taken to 'book-learning', as he called it, and his<br>English wasn't good. On Sunday afternoons, the only time when he<br>really took things easy, he'd settle down by the parlour fireplace<br>to have what he called a 'good read' at the Sunday paper. His<br>favourite paper was The People--Mother preferred the News of the<br>World, which she considered had more murders in it. I can see them<br>now. A Sunday afternoon--summer, of course, always summer--a smell<br>of roast pork and greens still floating in the air, and Mother on<br>one side of the fireplace, starting off to read the latest murder<br>but gradually falling asleep with her mouth open, and Father on the<br>other, in slippers and spectacles, working his way slowly through<br>the yards of smudgy print. And the soft feeling of summer all<br>round you, the geranium in the window, a starling cooing somewhere,<br>and myself under the table with the B.O.P., making believe that the<br>tablecloth is a tent. Afterwards, at tea, as he chewed his way<br>through the radishes and spring onions, Father would talk in a<br>ruminative kind of way about the stuff he'd been reading, the fires<br>and shipwrecks and scandals in high society, and these here new<br>flying machines and the chap (I notice that to this day he turns up<br>in the Sunday papers about once in three years) who was swallowed<br>by a whale in the Red Sea and taken out three days later, alive but<br>bleached white by the whale's gastric juice. Father was always a<br>bit sceptical of this story, and of the new flying machines,<br>otherwise he believed everything he read. Until 1909 no one in<br>Lower Binfield believed that human beings would ever learn to fly.<br>The official doctrine was that if God had meant us to fly He'd have<br>given us wings. Uncle Ezekiel couldn't help retorting that if God<br>had meant us to ride He'd have given us wheels, but even he didn't<br>believe in the new flying machines.<br><br>It was only on Sunday afternoons, and perhaps on the one evening a<br>week when he looked in at the George for a half-pint, that Father<br>turned his mind to such things. At other times he was always more<br>or less overwhelmed by business. There wasn't really such a lot to<br>do, but he seemed to be always busy, either in the loft behind the<br>yard, struggling about with sacks and bales, or in the kind of<br>dusty little cubby-hole behind the counter in the shop, adding<br>figures up in a notebook with a stump of pencil. He was a very<br>honest man and a very obliging man, very anxious to provide good<br>stuff and swindle nobody, which even in those days wasn't the best<br>way to get on in business. He would have been just the man for<br>some small official job, a postmaster, for instance, or station-<br>master of a country station. But he hadn't either the cheek and<br>enterprise to borrow money and expand the business, or the<br>imagination to think of new selling-lines. It was characteristic<br>of him that the only streak of imagination he ever showed, the<br>invention of a new seed mixture for cage-birds (Bowling's Mixture<br>it was called, and it was famous over a radius of nearly five<br>miles) was really due to Uncle Ezekiel. Uncle Ezekiel was a bit of<br>a bird-fancier and had quantities of goldfinches in his dark little<br>shop. It was his theory that cage-birds lose their colour because<br>of lack of variation in their diet. In the yard behind the shop<br>Father had a tiny plot of ground in which he used to grow about<br>twenty kinds of weed under wire-netting, and he used to dry them<br>and mix their seeds with ordinary canary seed. Jackie, the<br>bullfinch who hung in the shop-window, was supposed to be an<br>advertisement for Bowling's Mixture. Certainly, unlike most<br>bullfinches in cages, Jackie never turned black.<br><br>Mother was fat ever since I remember her. No doubt it's from her<br>that I inherit my pituitary deficiency, or whatever it is that<br>makes you get fat.<br><br>She was a largish woman, a bit taller than Father, with hair a good<br>deal fairer than his and a tendency to wear black dresses. But<br>except on Sundays I never remember her without an apron. It would<br>be an exaggeration, but not a very big one, to say that I never<br>remember her when she wasn't cooking. When you look back over a<br>long period you seem to see human beings always fixed in some<br>special place and some characteristic attitude. It seems to you<br>that they were always doing exactly the same thing. Well, just as<br>when I think of Father I remember him always behind the counter,<br>with his hair all mealy, adding up figures with a stump of pencil<br>which he moistens between his lips, and just as I remember Uncle<br>Ezekiel, with his ghostly white whiskers, straightening himself out<br>and slapping his leather apron, so when I think of Mother I<br>remember her at the kitchen table, with her forearms covered with<br>flour, rolling out a lump of dough.<br><br>You know the kind of kitchen people had in those days. A huge<br>place, rather dark and low, with a great beam across the ceiling<br>and a stone floor and cellars underneath. Everything enormous, or<br>so it seemed to me when I was a kid. A vast stone sink which<br>didn't have a tap but an iron pump, a dresser covering one wall and<br>going right up to the ceiling, a gigantic range which burned half a<br>ton a month and took God knows how long to blacklead. Mother at<br>the table rolling out a huge flap of dough. And myself crawling<br>round, messing about with bundles of firewood and lumps of coal and<br>tin beetle-traps (we had them in all the dark corners and they used<br>to be baited with beer) and now and again coming up to the table to<br>try and cadge a bit of food. Mother 'didn't hold with' eating<br>between meals. You generally got the same answer: 'Get along with<br>you, now! I'm not going to have you spoiling your dinner. Your<br>eye's bigger than your belly.' Very occasionally, however, she'd<br>cut you off a thin strip of candied peel.<br><br>I used to like to watch Mother rolling pastry. There's always a<br>fascination in watching anybody do a job which he really<br>understands. Watch a woman--a woman who really knows how to cook,<br>I mean--rolling dough. She's got a peculiar, solemn, indrawn air,<br>a satisfied kind of air, like a priestess celebrating a sacred<br>rite. And in her own mind, of course, that's exactly what she is.<br>Mother had thick, pink, strong forearms which were generally<br>mottled with flour. When she was cooking, all her movements were<br>wonderfully precise and firm. In her hands egg-whisks and mincers<br>and rolling-pins did exactly what they were meant to do. When you<br>saw her cooking you knew that she was in a world where she<br>belonged, among things she really understood. Except through the<br>Sunday papers and an occasional bit of gossip the outside world<br>didn't really exist for her. Although she read more easily than<br>Father, and unlike him used to read novelettes as well as<br>newspapers, she was unbelievably ignorant. I realized this even by<br>the time I was ten years old. She certainly couldn't have told you<br>whether Ireland was east or west of England, and I doubt whether<br>any time up to the outbreak of the Great War she could have told<br>you who was Prime Minister. Moreover she hadn't the smallest wish<br>to know such things. Later on when I read books about Eastern<br>countries where they practise polygamy, and the secret harems where<br>the women are locked up with black eunuchs mounting guard over<br>them, I used to think how shocked Mother would have been if she'd<br>heard of it. I can almost hear her voice--'Well, now! Shutting<br>their wives up like that! The IDEA!' Not that she'd have known<br>what a eunuch was. But in reality she lived her life in a space<br>that must have been as small and almost as private as the average<br>zenana. Even in our own house there were parts where she never set<br>foot. She never went into the loft behind the yard and very seldom<br>into the shop. I don't think I ever remember her serving a<br>customer. She wouldn't have known where any of the things were<br>kept, and until they were milled into flour she probably didn't<br>know the difference between wheat and oats. Why should she? The<br>shop was Father's business, it was 'the man's work', and even about<br>the money side of it she hadn't very much curiosity. Her job, 'the<br>woman's work', was to look after the house and the meals and the<br>laundry and the children. She'd have had a fit if she'd seen<br>Father or anyone else of the male sex trying to sew on a button for<br>himself.<br><br>So far as the meals and so forth went, ours was one of those houses<br>where everything goes like clockwork. Or no, not like clockwork,<br>which suggests something mechanical. It was more like some kind of<br>natural process. You knew that breakfast would be on the table<br>tomorrow morning in much the same way as you knew the sun would<br>rise. All through her life Mother went to bed at nine and got up<br>at five, and she'd have thought it vaguely wicked--sort of decadent<br>and foreign and aristocratic--to keep later hours. Although she<br>didn't mind paying Katie Simmons to take Joe and me out for walks,<br>she would never tolerate the idea of having a woman in to help with<br>the housework. It was her firm belief that a hired woman always<br>sweeps the dirt under the dresser. Our meals were always ready on<br>the tick. Enormous meals--boiled beef and dumplings, roast beef<br>and Yorkshire, boiled mutton and capers, pig's head, apple pie,<br>spotted dog, and jam roly-poly--with grace before and after. The<br>old ideas about bringing up children still held good, though they<br>were going out fast. In theory children were still thrashed and<br>put to bed on bread and water, and certainly you were liable to be<br>sent away from table if you made too much noise eating, or choked,<br>or refused something that was 'good for you', or 'answered back'.<br>In practice there wasn't much discipline in our family, and of the<br>two Mother was the firmer. Father, though he was always quoting<br>'Spare the rod and spoil the child', was really much too weak with<br>us, especially with Joe, who was a hard case from the start. He<br>was always 'going to' give Joe a good hiding, and he used to tell<br>us stories, which I now believe were lies, about the frightful<br>thrashings his own father used to give him with a leather strap,<br>but nothing ever came of it. By the time Joe was twelve he was too<br>strong for Mother to get him across her knee, and after that there<br>was no doing anything with him.<br><br>At that time it was still thought proper for parents to say 'don't'<br>to their children all day long. You'd often hear a man boasting<br>that he'd 'thrash the life out of' his son if he caught him<br>smoking, or stealing apples, or robbing a bird's nest. In some<br>families these thrashings actually took place. Old Lovegrove, the<br>saddler, caught his two sons, great lumps aged sixteen and fifteen,<br>smoking in the garden shed and walloped them so that you could hear<br>it all over the town. Lovegrove was a very heavy smoker. The<br>thrashings never seemed to have any effect, all boys stole apples,<br>robbed birds' nests, and learned to smoke sooner or later, but the<br>idea was still knocking around that children should be treated<br>rough. Practically everything worth doing was forbidden, in theory<br>anyway. According to Mother, everything that a boy ever wants to<br>do was 'dangerous'. Swimming was dangerous, climbing trees was<br>dangerous, and so were sliding, snowballing, hanging on behind<br>carts, using catapults and squailers, and even fishing. All<br>animals were dangerous, except Nailer, the two cats, and Jackie the<br>bullfinch. Every animal had its special recognized methods of<br>attacking you. Horses bit, bats got into your hair, earwigs got<br>into your ears, swans broke your leg with a blow of their wings,<br>bulls tossed you, and snakes 'stung'. All snakes stung, according<br>to Mother, and when I quoted the penny encyclopedia to the effect<br>that they didn't sting but bit, she only told me not to answer<br>back. Lizards, slow-worms, toads, frogs, and newts also stung.<br>All insects stung, except flies and blackbeetles. Practically all<br>kinds of food, except the food you had at meals, were either<br>poisonous or 'bad for you'. Raw potatoes were deadly poison, and<br>so were mushrooms unless you bought them at the greengrocer's. Raw<br>gooseberries gave you colic and raw raspberries gave you a skin-<br>rash. If you had a bath after a meal you died of cramp, if you cut<br>yourself between the thumb and forefinger you got lockjaw, and if<br>you washed your hands in the water eggs were boiled in you got<br>warts. Nearly everything in the shop was poisonous, which was why<br>Mother had put the gate in the doorway. Cowcake was poisonous, and<br>so was chicken corn, and so were mustard seed and Karswood poultry<br>spice. Sweets were bad for you and eating between meals was bad<br>for you, though curiously enough there were certain kinds of eating<br>between meals that Mother always allowed. When she was making plum<br>jam she used to let us eat the syrupy stuff that was skimmed off<br>the top, and we used to gorge ourselves with it till we were sick.<br>Although nearly everything in the world was either dangerous or<br>poisonous, there were certain things that had mysterious virtues.<br>Raw onions were a cure for almost everything. A stocking tied<br>round your neck was a cure for a sore throat. Sulphur in a dog's<br>drinking water acted as a tonic, and old Nailer's bowl behind the<br>back door always had a lump of sulphur in it which stayed there<br>year after year, never dissolving.<br><br>We used to have tea at six. By four Mother had generally finished<br>the housework, and between four and six she used to have a quiet<br>cup of tea and 'read her paper', as she called it. As a matter of<br>fact she didn't often read the newspaper except on Sundays. The<br>week-day papers only had the day's news, and it was only<br>occasionally that there was a murder. But the editors of the<br>Sunday papers had grasped that people don't really mind whether<br>their murders are up to date and when there was no new murder on<br>hand they'd hash up an old one, sometimes going as far back as Dr<br>Palmer and Mrs Manning. I think Mother thought of the world<br>outside Lower Binfleld chiefly as a place where murders were<br>committed. Murders had a terrible fascination for her, because, as<br>she often said, she just didn't know how people could BE so wicked.<br>Cutting their wives' throats, burying their fathers under cement<br>floors, throwing babies down wells! How anyone could DO such<br>things! The Jack the Ripper scare had happened about the time when<br>Father and Mother were married, and the big wooden shutters we used<br>to draw over the shop windows every night dated from then.<br>Shutters for shop windows were going out, most of the shops in the<br>High Street didn't have them, but Mother felt safe behind them.<br>All along, she said, she'd had a dreadful feeling that Jack the<br>Ripper was hiding in Lower Binfield. The Crippen case--but that<br>was years later, when I was almost grown up--upset her badly. I<br>can hear her voice now. 'Gutting his poor wife up and burying her<br>in the coal cellar! The IDEA! What I'd do to that man if I got<br>hold of him!' And curiously enough, when she thought of the<br>dreadful wickedness of that little American doctor who dismembered<br>his wife (and made a very neat job of it by taking all the bones<br>out and chucking the head into the sea, if I remember rightly) the<br>tears actually came into her eyes.<br><br>But what she mostly read on week-days was Hilda's Home Companion.<br>In those days it was part of the regular furnishing of any home<br>like ours, and as a matter of fact it still exists, though it's<br>been a bit crowded out by the more streamlined women's papers that<br>have come up since the war. I had a look at a copy only the other<br>day. It's changed, but less than most things. There are still the<br>same enormous serial stories that go on for six months (and it all<br>comes right in the end with orange blossoms to follow), and the<br>same Household Hints, and the same ads for sewing-machines and<br>remedies for bad legs. It's chiefly the print and the illustrations<br>that have changed. In those days the heroine had to look like an<br>egg-timer and now she has to look like a cylinder. Mother was a slow<br>reader and believed in getting her threepennyworth out of Hilda's<br>Home Companion. Sitting in the old yellow armchair beside the<br>hearth, with her feet on the iron fender and the little pot of<br>strong tea stewing on the hob, she'd work her way steadily from<br>cover to cover, right through the serial, the two short stories,<br>the Household Hints, the ads for Zam-Buk, and the answers to<br>correspondents. Hilda's Home Companion generally lasted her the<br>week out, and some weeks she didn't even finish it. Sometimes the<br>heat of the fire, or the buzzing of the bluebottles on summer<br>afternoons, would send her off into a doze, and at about a quarter<br>to six she'd wake up with a tremendous start, glance at the clock on<br>the mantelpiece, and then get into a stew because tea was going to<br>be late. But tea was never late.<br><br>In those days--till 1909, to be exact--Father could still afford an<br>errand boy, and he used to leave the shop to him and come in to tea<br>with the backs of his hands all mealy. Then Mother would stop<br>cutting slices of bread for a moment and say, 'If you'll give us<br>grace, Father', and Father, while we all bent our heads on our<br>chests, would mumble reverently, 'Fwat we bout to receive--Lord<br>make us truly thankful--Amen.' Later on, when Joe was a bit older,<br>it would be 'YOU give us grace today, Joe', and Joe would pipe it<br>out. Mother never said grace: it had to be someone of the male<br>sex.<br><br>There were always bluebottles buzzing on summer afternoons. Ours<br>wasn't a sanitary house, precious few houses in Lower Binfield<br>were. I suppose the town must have contained five hundred houses<br>and there certainly can't have been more than ten with bathrooms or<br>fifty with what we should now describe as a W.C. In summer our<br>backyard always smelt of dustbins. And all houses had insects in<br>them. We had blackbeetles in the wainscoting and crickets<br>somewhere behind the kitchen range, besides, of course, the meal-<br>worms in the shop. In those days even a house-proud woman like<br>Mother didn't see anything to object to in blackbeetles. They were<br>as much a part of the kitchen as the dresser or the rolling-pin.<br>But there were insects and insects. The houses in the bad street<br>behind the brewery, where Katie Simmons lived, were overrun by<br>bugs. Mother or any of the shopkeepers' wives would have died of<br>shame if they'd had bugs in the house. In fact it was considered<br>proper to say that you didn't even know a bug by sight.<br><br>The great blue flies used to come sailing into the larder and sit<br>longingly on the wire covers over the meat. 'Drat the flies!'<br>people used to say, but the flies were an act of God and apart from<br>meat-covers and fly-papers you couldn't do much about them. I said<br>a little while back that the first thing I remember is the smell of<br>sainfoin, but the smell of dustbins is also a pretty early memory.<br>When I think of Mother's kitchen, with the stone floor and the<br>beetle-traps and the steel fender and the blackleaded range, I<br>always seem to hear the bluebottles buzzing and smell the dustbin,<br>and also old Nailer, who carried a pretty powerful smell of dog.<br>And God knows there are worse smells and sounds. Which would you<br>sooner listen to, a bluebottle or a bombing plane? <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/4.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/6.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
