<h2>Part 2, Chapter 4</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">For the next seven years, from when I was eight to when I was<br>fifteen, what I chiefly remember is fishing.<br><br>Don't think that I did nothing else. It's only that when you look<br>back over a long period of time, certain things seem to swell up<br>till they overshadow everything else. I left Mother Howlett's and<br>went to the Grammar School, with a leather satchel and a black cap<br>with yellow stripes, and got my first bicycle and a long time<br>afterwards my first long trousers. My first bike was a fixed-<br>wheel--free-wheel bikes were very expensive then. When you went<br>downhill you put your feet up on the front rests and let the pedals<br>go whizzing round. That was one of the characteristic sights of<br>the early nineteen-hundreds--a boy sailing downhill with his head<br>back and his feet up in the air. I went to the Grammar School in<br>fear and trembling, because of the frightful tales Joe had told me<br>about old Whiskers (his name was Wicksey) the headmaster, who was<br>certainly a dreadful-looking little man, with a face just like a<br>wolf, and at the end of the big schoolroom he had a glass case with<br>canes in it, which he'd sometimes take out and swish through the<br>air in a terrifying manner. But to my surprise I did rather well<br>at school. It had never occurred to me that I might be cleverer<br>than Joe, who was two years older than me and had bullied me ever<br>since he could walk. Actually Joe was an utter dunce, got the cane<br>about once a week, and stayed somewhere near the bottom of the<br>school till he was sixteen. My second term I took a prize in<br>arithmetic and another in some queer stuff that was mostly<br>concerned with pressed flowers and went by the name of Science, and<br>by the time I was fourteen Whiskers was talking about scholarships<br>and Reading University. Father, who had ambitions for Joe and me<br>in those days, was very anxious that I should go to 'college'.<br>There was an idea floating round that I was to be a schoolteacher<br>and Joe was to be an auctioneer.<br><br>But I haven't many memories connected with school. When I've mixed<br>with chaps from the upper classes, as I did during the war, I've<br>been struck by the fact that they never really get over that<br>frightful drilling they go through at public schools. Either it<br>flattens them out into half-wits or they spend the rest of their<br>lives kicking against it. It wasn't so with boys of our class, the<br>sons of shopkeepers and farmers. You went to the Grammar School<br>and you stayed there till you were sixteen, just to show that you<br>weren't a prole, but school was chiefly a place that you wanted to<br>get away from. You'd no sentiment of loyalty, no goofy feeling<br>about the old grey stones (and they WERE old, right enough, the<br>school had been founded by Cardinal Wolsey), and there was no Old<br>Boy's tie and not even a school song. You had your half-holidays<br>to yourself, because games weren't compulsory and as often as not<br>you cut them. We played football in braces, and though it was<br>considered proper to play cricket in a belt, you wore your ordinary<br>shirt and trousers. The only game I really cared about was the<br>stump cricket we used to play in the gravel yard during the break,<br>with a bat made out of a bit of packing case and a compo ball.<br><br>But I remember the smell of the big schoolroom, a smell of ink and<br>dust and boots, and the stone in the yard that had been a mounting<br>block and was used for sharpening knives on, and the little baker's<br>shop opposite where they sold a kind of Chelsea bun, twice the size<br>of the Chelsea buns you get nowadays, which were called Lardy<br>Busters and cost a halfpenny. I did all the things you do at<br>school. I carved my name on a desk and got the cane for it--you<br>were always caned for it if you were caught, but it was the<br>etiquette that you had to carve your name. And I got inky fingers<br>and bit my nails and made darts out of penholders and played<br>conkers and passed round dirty stories and learned to masturbate<br>and cheeked old Blowers, the English master, and bullied the life<br>out of little Willy Simeon, the undertaker's son, who was half-<br>witted and believed everything you told him. Our favourite trick<br>was to send him to shops to buy things that didn't exist. All the<br>old gags--the ha'porth of penny stamps, the rubber hammer, the<br>left-handed screwdriver, the pot of striped paint--poor Willy fell<br>for all of them. We had grand sport one afternoon, putting him in<br>a tub and telling him to lift himself up by the handles. He ended<br>up in an asylum, poor Willy. But it was in the holidays that one<br>really lived.<br><br>There were good things to do in those days. In winter we used to<br>borrow a couple of ferrets--Mother would never let Joe and me keep<br>them at home, 'nasty smelly things' she called them--and go round<br>the farms and ask leave to do a bit of ratting. Sometimes they let<br>us, sometimes they told us to hook it and said we were more trouble<br>than the rats. Later in winter we'd follow the threshing machine<br>and help kill the rats when they threshed the stacks. One winter,<br>1908 it must have been, the Thames flooded and then froze and there<br>was skating for weeks on end, and Harry Barnes broke his collar-<br>bone on the ice. In early spring we went after squirrels with<br>squailers, and later on we went birdnesting. We had a theory that<br>birds can't count and it's all right if you leave one egg, but we<br>were cruel little beasts and sometimes we'd just knock the nest<br>down and trample on the eggs or chicks. There was another game we<br>had when the toads were spawning. We used to catch toads, ram the<br>nozzle of a bicycle pump up their backsides, and blow them up till<br>they burst. That's what boys are like, I don't know why. In<br>summer we used to bike over the Burford Weir and bathe. Wally<br>Lovegrove, Sid's young cousin, was drowned in 1906. He got tangled<br>in the weeds at the bottom, and when the drag-hooks brought his<br>body to the surface his face was jet black.<br><br>But fishing was the real thing. We went many a time to old<br>Brewer's pool, and took tiny carp and tench out of it, and once a<br>whopping eel, and there were other cow-ponds that had fish in them<br>and were within walking distance on Saturday afternoons. But after<br>we got bicycles we started fishing in the Thames below Burford<br>Weir. It seemed more grown-up than fishing in cow-ponds. There<br>were no farmers chasing you away, and there are thumping fish in<br>the Thames--though, so far as I know, nobody's ever been known to<br>catch one.<br><br>It's queer, the feeling I had for fishing--and still have, really.<br>I can't call myself a fisherman. I've never in my life caught a<br>fish two feet long, and it's thirty years now since I've had a rod<br>in my hands. And yet when I look back the whole of my boyhood from<br>eight to fifteen seems to have revolved round the days when we went<br>fishing. Every detail has stuck clear in my memory. I can<br>remember individual days and individual fish, there isn't a cow-<br>pond or a backwater that I can't see a picture of if I shut my eyes<br>and think. I could write a book on the technique of fishing. When<br>we were kids we didn't have much in the way of tackle, it cost too<br>much and most of our threepence a week (which was the usual pocket-<br>money in those days) went on sweets and Lardy Busters. Very small<br>kids generally fish with a bent pin, which is too blunt to be much<br>use, but you can make a pretty good hook (though of course it's got<br>no barb) by bending a needle in a candle flame with a pair of<br>pliers. The farm lads knew how to plait horsehair so that it was<br>almost as good as gut, and you can take a small fish on a single<br>horsehair. Later we got to having two-shilling fishing-rods and<br>even reels of sorts. God, what hours I've spent gazing into<br>Wallace's window! Even the .410 guns and saloon pistols didn't<br>thrill me so much as the fishing tackle. And the copy of Gamage's<br>catalogue that I picked up somewhere, on a rubbish dump I think,<br>and studied as though it had been the Bible! Even now I could give<br>you all the details about gut-substitute and gimp and Limerick<br>hooks and priests and disgorgers and Nottingham reels and God knows<br>how many other technicalities.<br><br>Then there were the kinds of bait we used to use. In our shop<br>there were always plenty of mealworms, which were good but not very<br>good. Gentles were better. You had to beg them off old Gravitt,<br>the butcher, and the gang used to draw lots or do enamena-mina-mo<br>to decide who should go and ask, because Gravitt wasn't usually too<br>pleasant about it. He was a big, rough-faced old devil with a<br>voice like a mastiff, and when he barked, as he generally did when<br>speaking to boys, all the knives and steels on his blue apron would<br>give a jingle. You'd go in with an empty treacle-tin in your hand,<br>hang round till any customers had disappeared and then say very<br>humbly:<br><br>'Please, Mr Gravitt, y'got any gentles today?'<br><br>Generally he'd roar out: 'What! Gentles! Gentles in my shop!<br>Ain't seen such a thing in years. Think I got blow-flies in my<br>shop?'<br><br>He had, of course. They were everywhere. He used to deal with<br>them with a strip of leather on the end of a stick, with which he<br>could reach out to enormous distances and smack a fly into paste.<br>Sometimes you had to go away without any gentles, but as a rule<br>he'd shout after you just as you were going:<br><br>''Ere! Go round the backyard an' 'ave a look. P'raps you might<br>find one or two if you looked careful.'<br><br>You used to find them in little clusters everywhere. Gravitt's<br>backyard smelt like a battlefield. Butchers didn't have<br>refrigerators in those days. Gentles live longer if you keep them<br>in sawdust.<br><br>Wasp grubs are good, though it's hard to make them stick on the<br>hook, unless you bake them first. When someone found a wasps' nest<br>we'd go out at night and pour turpentine down it and plug up the<br>hole with mud. Next day the wasps would all be dead and you could<br>dig out the nest and take the grubs. Once something went wrong,<br>the turps missed the hole or something, and when we took the plug<br>out the wasps, which had been shut up all night, came out all<br>together with a zoom. We weren't very badly stung, but it was a<br>pity there was no one standing by with a stopwatch. Grasshoppers<br>are about the best bait there is, especially for chub. You stick<br>them on the hook without any shot and just flick them to and fro on<br>the surface--'dapping', they call it. But you can never get more<br>than two or three grasshoppers at a time. Greenbottle flies, which<br>are also damned difficult to catch, are the best bait for dace,<br>especially on clear days. You want to put them on the hook alive,<br>so that they wriggle. A chub will even take a wasp, but it's a<br>ticklish job to put a live wasp on the hook.<br><br>God knows how many other baits there were. Bread paste you make by<br>squeezing water through white bread in a rag. Then there are<br>cheese paste and honey paste and paste with aniseed in it. Boiled<br>wheat isn't bad for roach. Redworms are good for gudgeon. You<br>find them in very old manure heaps. And you also find another kind<br>of worm called a brandling, which is striped and smells like an<br>earwig, and which is very good bait for perch. Ordinary earthworms<br>are good for perch. You have to put them in moss to keep them<br>fresh and lively. If you try to keep them in earth they die.<br>Those brown flies you find on cowdung are pretty good for roach.<br>You can take a chub on a cherry, so they say, and I've seen a roach<br>taken with a currant out of a bun.<br><br>In those days, from the sixteenth of June (when the coarse-fishing<br>season starts) till midwinter I wasn't often without a tin of worms<br>or gentles in my pocket. I had some fights with Mother about it,<br>but in the end she gave in, fishing came off the list of forbidden<br>things and Father even gave me a two-shilling fishing-rod for<br>Christmas in 1903. Joe was barely fifteen when he started going<br>after girls, and from then on he seldom came out fishing, which he<br>said was a kid's game. But there were about half a dozen others<br>who were as mad on fishing as I was. Christ, those fishing days!<br>The hot sticky afternoons in the schoolroom when I've sprawled<br>across my desk, with old Blowers's voice grating away about<br>predicates and subjunctives and relative clauses, and all that's in<br>my mind is the backwater near Burford Weir and the green pool under<br>the willows with the dace gliding to and fro. And then the<br>terrific rush on bicycles after tea, to Chamford Hill and down to<br>the river to get in an hour's fishing before dark. The still<br>summer evening, the faint splash of the weir, the rings on the<br>water where the fish are rising, the midges eating you alive, the<br>shoals of dace swarming round your hook and never biting. And the<br>kind of passion with which you'd watch the black backs of the fish<br>swarming round, hoping and praying (yes, literally praying) that<br>one of them would change his mind and grab your bait before it got<br>too dark. And then it was always 'Let's have five minutes more',<br>and then 'Just five minutes more', until in the end you had to walk<br>your bike into the town because Towler, the copper, was prowling<br>round and you could be 'had up' for riding without a light. And<br>the times in the summer holidays when we went out to make a day of<br>it with boiled eggs and bread and butter and a bottle of lemonade,<br>and fished and bathed and then fished again and did occasionally<br>catch something. At night you'd come home with filthy hands so<br>hungry that you'd eaten what was left of your bread paste, with<br>three or four smelly dace wrapped up in your handkerchief. Mother<br>always refused to cook the fish I brought home. She would never<br>allow that river fish were edible, except trout and salmon. 'Nasty<br>muddy things', she called them. The fish I remember best of all<br>are the ones I didn't catch. Especially the monstrous fish you<br>always used to see when you went for a walk along the towpath on<br>Sunday afternoons and hadn't a rod with you. There was no fishing<br>on Sundays, even the Thames Conservancy Board didn't allow it. On<br>Sundays you had to go for what was called a 'nice walk' in your<br>thick black suit and the Eton collar that sawed your head off. It<br>was on a Sunday that I saw a pike a yard long asleep in shallow<br>water by the bank and nearly got him with a stone. And sometimes<br>in the green pools on the edge of the reeds you'd see a huge Thames<br>trout go sailing past. The trout grow to vast sizes in the Thames,<br>but they're practically never caught. They say that one of the<br>real Thames fishermen, the old bottle-nosed blokes that you see<br>muffled up in overcoats on camp-stools with twenty-foot roach-poles<br>at all seasons of the year, will willingly give up a year of his<br>life to catching a Thames trout. I don't blame them, I see their<br>point entirely, and still better I saw it then.<br><br>Of course other things were happening. I grew three inches in a<br>year, got my long trousers, won some prizes at school, went to<br>Confirmation classes, told dirty stories, took to reading, and had<br>crazes for white mice, fretwork, and postage stamps. But it's<br>always fishing that I remember. Summer days, and the flat water-<br>meadows and the blue hills in the distance, and the willows up the<br>backwater and the pools underneath like a kind of deep green glass.<br>Summer evenings, the fish breaking the water, the nightjars hawking<br>round your head, the smell of nightstocks and latakia. Don't<br>mistake what I'm talking about. It's not that I'm trying to put<br>across any of that poetry of childhood stuff. I know that's all<br>baloney. Old Porteous (a friend of mine, a retired schoolmaster,<br>I'll tell you about him later) is great on the poetry of childhood.<br>Sometimes he reads me stuff about it out of books. Wordsworth.<br>Lucy Gray. There was a time when meadow, grove, and all that.<br>Needless to say he's got no kids of his own. The truth is that<br>kids aren't in any way poetic, they're merely savage little<br>animals, except that no animal is a quarter as selfish. A boy<br>isn't interested in meadows, groves, and so forth. He never looks<br>at a landscape, doesn't give a damn for flowers, and unless they<br>affect him in some way, such as being good to eat, he doesn't know<br>one plant from another. Killing things--that's about as near to<br>poetry as a boy gets. And yet all the while there's that peculiar<br>intensity, the power of longing for things as you can't long when<br>you're grown up, and the feeling that time stretches out and out in<br>front of you and that whatever you're doing you could go on for<br>ever.<br><br>I was rather an ugly little boy, with butter-coloured hair which<br>was always cropped short except for a quiff in front. I don't<br>idealize my childhood, and unlike many people I've no wish to be<br>young again. Most of the things I used to care for would leave me<br>something more than cold. I don't care if I never see a cricket<br>ball again, and I wouldn't give you threepence for a hundredweight<br>of sweets. But I've still got, I've always had, that peculiar<br>feeling for fishing. You'll think it damned silly, no doubt, but<br>I've actually half a wish to go fishing even now, when I'm fat and<br>forty-five and got two kids and a house in the suburbs. Why?<br>Because in a manner of speaking I AM sentimental about my<br>childhood--not my own particular childhood, but the civilization<br>which I grew up in and which is now, I suppose, just about at its<br>last kick. And fishing is somehow typical of that civilization.<br>As soon as you think of fishing you think of things that don't<br>belong to the modern world. The very idea of sitting all day under<br>a willow tree beside a quiet pool--and being able to find a quiet<br>pool to sit beside--belongs to the time before the war, before the<br>radio, before aeroplanes, before Hitler. There's a kind of<br>peacefulness even in the names of English coarse fish. Roach,<br>rudd, dace, bleak, barbel, bream, gudgeon, pike, chub, carp, tench.<br>They're solid kind of names. The people who made them up hadn't<br>heard of machine-guns, they didn't live in terror of the sack or<br>spend their time eating aspirins, going to the pictures, and<br>wondering how to keep out of the concentration camp.<br><br>Does anyone go fishing nowadays, I wonder? Anywhere within a<br>hundred miles of London there are no fish left to catch. A few<br>dismal fishing-clubs plant themselves in rows along the banks of<br>canals, and millionaires go trout-fishing in private waters round<br>Scotch hotels, a sort of snobbish game of catching hand-reared fish<br>with artificial flies. But who fishes in mill-streams or moats or<br>cow-ponds any longer? Where are the English coarse fish now? When<br>I was a kid every pond and stream had fish in it. Now all the<br>ponds are drained, and when the streams aren't poisoned with<br>chemicals from factories they're full of rusty tins and motor-bike<br>tyres.<br><br>My best fishing-memory is about some fish that I never caught.<br>That's usual enough, I suppose.<br><br>When I was about fourteen Father did a good turn of some kind to<br>old Hodges, the caretaker at Binfield House. I forget what it was--<br>gave him some medicine that cured his fowls of the worms, or<br>something. Hodges was a crabby old devil, but he didn't forget a<br>good turn. One day a little while afterwards when he'd been down<br>to the shop to buy chicken-corn he met me outside the door and<br>stopped me in his surly way. He had a face like something carved<br>out of a bit of root, and only two teeth, which were dark brown and<br>very long.<br><br>'Hey, young 'un! Fisherman, ain't you?'<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>'Thought you was. You listen, then. If so be you wanted to, you<br>could bring your line and have a try in that they pool up ahind the<br>Hall. There's plenty bream and jack in there. But don't you tell<br>no one as I told you. And don't you go for to bring any of them<br>other young whelps, or I'll beat the skin off their backs.'<br><br>Having said this he hobbled off with his sack of corn over his<br>shoulder, as though feeling that he'd said too much already. The<br>next Saturday afternoon I biked up to Binfield House with my<br>pockets full of worms and gentles, and looked for old Hodges at the<br>lodge. At that time Binfield House had already been empty for ten<br>or twenty years. Mr Farrel, the owner, couldn't afford to live in<br>it and either couldn't or wouldn't let it. He lived in London on<br>the rent of his farms and let the house and grounds go to the<br>devil. All the fences were green and rotting, the park was a mass<br>of nettles, the plantations were like a jungle, and even the<br>gardens had gone back to meadow, with only a few old gnarled rose-<br>bushes to show you where the beds had been. But it was a very<br>beautiful house, especially from a distance. It was a great white<br>place with colonnades and long-shaped windows, which had been<br>built, I suppose, about Queen Anne's time by someone who'd<br>travelled in Italy. If I went there now I'd probably get a certain<br>kick out of wandering round the general desolation and thinking<br>about the life that used to go on there, and the people who built<br>such places because they imagined that the good days would last for<br>ever. As a boy I didn't give either the house or the grounds a<br>second look. I dug out old Hodges, who'd just finished his dinner<br>and was a bit surly, and got him to show me the way down to the<br>pool. It was several hundred yards behind the house and completely<br>hidden in the beech woods, but it was a good-sized pool, almost a<br>lake, about a hundred and fifty yards across. It was astonishing,<br>and even at that age it astonished me, that there, a dozen miles<br>from Reading and not fifty from London, you could have such<br>solitude. You felt as much alone as if you'd been on the banks of<br>the Amazon. The pool was ringed completely round by the enormous<br>beech trees, which in one place came down to the edge and were<br>reflected in the water. On the other side there was a patch of<br>grass where there was a hollow with beds of wild peppermint, and up<br>at one end of the pool an old wooden boathouse was rotting among<br>the bulrushes.<br><br>The pool was swarming with bream, small ones, about four to six<br>inches long. Every now and again you'd see one of them turn half<br>over and gleam reddy brown under the water. There were pike there<br>too, and they must have been big ones. You never saw them, but<br>sometimes one that was basking among the weeds would turn over and<br>plunge with a splash that was like a brick being bunged into the<br>water. It was no use trying to catch them, though of course I<br>always tried every time I went there. I tried them with dace and<br>minnows I'd caught in the Thames and kept alive in a jam-jar, and<br>even with a spinner made out of a bit of tin. But they were gorged<br>with fish and wouldn't bite, and in any case they'd have broken any<br>tackle I possessed. I never came back from the pool without at<br>least a dozen small bream. Sometimes in the summer holidays I went<br>there for a whole day, with my fishing-rod and a copy of Chums or<br>the Union Jack or something, and a hunk of bread and cheese which<br>Mother had wrapped up for me. And I've fished for hours and then<br>lain in the grass hollow and read the Union Jack, and then the<br>smell of my bread paste and the plop of a fish jumping somewhere<br>would send me wild again, and I'd go back to the water and have<br>another go, and so on all through a summer's day. And the best of<br>all was to be alone, utterly alone, though the road wasn't a<br>quarter of a mile away. I was just old enough to know that it's<br>good to be alone occasionally. With the trees all round you it was<br>as though the pool belonged to you, and nothing ever stirred except<br>the fish ringing the water and the pigeons passing overhead. And<br>yet, in the two years or so that I went fishing there, how many<br>times did I really go, I wonder? Not more than a dozen. It was a<br>three-mile bike ride from home and took up a whole afternoon at<br>least. And sometimes other things turned up, and sometimes when<br>I'd meant to go it rained. You know the way things happen.<br><br>One afternoon the fish weren't biting and I began to explore at the<br>end of the pool farthest from Binfield House. There was a bit of<br>an overflow of water and the ground was boggy, and you had to fight<br>your way through a sort of jungle of blackberry bushes and rotten<br>boughs that had fallen off the trees. I struggled through it for<br>about fifty yards, and then suddenly there was a clearing and I<br>came to another pool which I had never known existed. It was a<br>small pool not more than twenty yards wide, and rather dark because<br>of the boughs that overhung it. But it was very clear water and<br>immensely deep. I could see ten or fifteen feet down into it. I<br>hung about for a bit, enjoying the dampness and the rotten boggy<br>smell, the way a boy does. And then I saw something that almost<br>made me jump out of my skin.<br><br>It was an enormous fish. I don't exaggerate when I say it was<br>enormous. It was almost the length of my arm. It glided across<br>the pool, deep under water, and then became a shadow and<br>disappeared into the darker water on the other side. I felt as if<br>a sword had gone through me. It was far the biggest fish I'd ever<br>seen, dead or alive. I stood there without breathing, and in a<br>moment another huge thick shape glided through the water, and then<br>another and then two more close together. The pool was full of<br>them. They were carp, I suppose. Just possibly they were bream or<br>tench, but more probably carp. Bream or tench wouldn't grow so<br>huge. I knew what had happened. At some time this pool had been<br>connected with the other, and then the stream had dried up and the<br>woods had closed round the small pool and it had just been<br>forgotten. It's a thing that happens occasionally. A pool gets<br>forgotten somehow, nobody fishes in it for years and decades and<br>the fish grow to monstrous sizes. The brutes that I was watching<br>might be a hundred years old. And not a soul in the world knew<br>about them except me. Very likely it was twenty years since anyone<br>had so much as looked at the pool, and probably even old Hodges and<br>Mr Farrel's bailiff had forgotten its existence.<br><br>Well, you can imagine what I felt. After a bit I couldn't even<br>bear the tantalization of watching. I hurried back to the other<br>pool and got my fishing things together. It was no use trying for<br>those colossal brutes with the tackle I had. They'd snap it as if<br>it had been a hair. And I couldn't go on fishing any longer for<br>the tiny bream. The sight of the big carp had given me a feeling<br>in my stomach almost as if I was going to be sick. I got on to my<br>bike and whizzed down the hill and home. It was a wonderful secret<br>for a boy to have. There was the dark pool hidden away in the<br>woods and the monstrous fish sailing round it--fish that had never<br>been fished for and would grab the first bait you offered them. It<br>was only a question of getting hold of a line strong enough to hold<br>them. Already I'd made all the arrangements. I'd buy the tackle<br>that would hold them if I had to steal the money out of the till.<br>Somehow, God knew how, I'd get hold of half a crown and buy a<br>length of silk salmon line and some thick gut or gimp and Number 5<br>hooks, and come back with cheese and gentles and paste and<br>mealworms and brandlings and grasshoppers and every mortal bait a<br>carp might look at. The very next Saturday afternoon I'd come back<br>and try for them.<br><br>But as it happened I never went back. One never does go back. I<br>never stole the money out of the till or bought the bit of salmon<br>line or had a try for those carp. Almost immediately afterwards<br>something turned up to prevent me, but if it hadn't been that it<br>would have been something else. It's the way things happen.<br><br>I know, of course, that you think I'm exaggerating about the size<br>of those fish. You think, probably, that they were just medium-<br>sized fish (a foot long, say) and that they've swollen gradually in<br>my memory. But it isn't so. People tell lies about the fish<br>they've caught and still more about the fish that are hooked and<br>get away, but I never caught any of these or even tried to catch<br>them, and I've no motive for lying. I tell you they were enormous.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/6.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/8.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
