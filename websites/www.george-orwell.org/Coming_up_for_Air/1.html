<h2>Part 1, Chapter 2</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Do you know the road I live in--Ellesmere Road, West Bletchley?<br>Even if you don't, you know fifty others exactly like it.<br><br>You know how these streets fester all over the inner-outer suburbs.<br>Always the same. Long, long rows of little semi-detached houses--<br>the numbers in Ellesmere Road run to 212 and ours is 191--as much<br>alike as council houses and generally uglier. The stucco front,<br>the creosoted gate, the privet hedge, the green front door. The<br>Laurels, the Myrtles, the Hawthorns, Mon Abri, Mon Repos, Belle<br>Vue. At perhaps one house in fifty some anti-social type who'll<br>probably end in the workhouse has painted his front door blue<br>instead of green.<br><br>That sticky feeling round my neck had put me into a demoralized<br>kind of mood. It's curious how it gets you down to have a sticky<br>neck. It seems to take all the bounce out of you, like when you<br>suddenly discover in a public place that the sole of one of your<br>shoes is coming off. I had no illusions about myself that morning.<br>It was almost as if I could stand at a distance and watch myself<br>coming down the road, with my fat, red face and my false teeth and<br>my vulgar clothes. A chap like me is incapable of looking like a<br>gentleman. Even if you saw me at two hundred yards' distance you'd<br>know immediately--not, perhaps, that I was in the insurance<br>business, but that I was some kind of tout or salesman. The<br>clothes I was wearing were practically the uniform of the tribe.<br>Grey herring-bone suit, a bit the worse for wear, blue overcoat<br>costing fifty shillings, bowler hat, and no gloves. And I've got<br>the look that's peculiar to people who sell things on commission, a<br>kind of coarse, brazen look. At my best moments, when I've got a<br>new suit or when I'm smoking a cigar, I might pass for a bookie or<br>a publican, and when things are very bad I might be touting vacuum<br>cleaners, but at ordinary times you'd place me correctly. 'Five to<br>ten quid a week', you'd say as soon as you saw me. Economically<br>and socially I'm about at the average level of Ellesmere Road.<br><br>I had the street pretty much to myself. The men had bunked to<br>catch the 8.21 and the women were fiddling with the gas-stoves.<br>When you've time to look about you, and when you happen to be in<br>the right mood, it's a thing that makes you laugh inside to walk<br>down these streets in the inner-outer suburbs and to think of the<br>lives that go on there. Because, after all, what IS a road like<br>Ellesmere Road? Just a prison with the cells all in a row. A line<br>of semidetached torture-chambers where the poor little five-to-ten-<br>pound-a-weekers quake and shiver, every one of them with the boss<br>twisting his tail and his wife riding him like the nightmare and<br>the kids sucking his blood like leeches. There's a lot of rot<br>talked about the sufferings of the working class. I'm not so sorry<br>for the proles myself. Did you ever know a navvy who lay awake<br>thinking about the sack? The prole suffers physically, but he's a<br>free man when he isn't working. But in every one of those little<br>stucco boxes there's some poor bastard who's NEVER free except when<br>he's fast asleep and dreaming that he's got the boss down the<br>bottom of a well and is bunging lumps of coal at him.<br><br>Of course, the basic trouble with people like us, I said to myself,<br>is that we all imagine we've got something to lose. To begin with,<br>nine-tenths of the people in Ellesmere Road are under the<br>impression that they own their houses. Ellesmere Road, and the<br>whole quarter surrounding it, until you get to the High Street, is<br>part of a huge racket called the Hesperides Estate, the property of<br>the Cheerful Credit Building Society. Building societies are<br>probably the cleverest racket of modern times. My own line,<br>insurance, is a swindle, I admit, but it's an open swindle with the<br>cards on the table. But the beauty of the building society<br>swindles is that your victims think you're doing them a kindness.<br>You wallop them, and they lick your hand. I sometimes think I'd<br>like to have the Hesperides Estate surmounted by an enormous statue<br>to the god of building societies. It would be a queer sort of god.<br>Among other things it would be bisexual. The top half would be a<br>managing director and the bottom half would be a wife in the family<br>way. In one hand it would carry an enormous key--the key of the<br>workhouse, of course--and in the other--what do they call those<br>things like French horns with presents coming out of them?--a<br>cornucopia, out of which would be pouring portable radios, life-<br>insurance policies, false teeth, aspirins, French letters, and<br>concrete garden rollers.<br><br>As a matter of fact, in Ellesmere Road we don't own our houses,<br>even when we've finished paying for them. They're not freehold,<br>only leasehold. They're priced at five-fifty, payable over a<br>period of sixteen years, and they're a class of house, which, if<br>you bought them for cash down, would cost round about three-eighty.<br>That represents a profit of a hundred and seventy for the Cheerful<br>Credit, but needless to say that Cheerful Credit makes a lot more<br>out of it than that. Three-eighty includes the builder's profit,<br>but the Cheerful Credit, under the name of Wilson & Bloom, builds<br>the houses itself and scoops the builder's profit. All it has to<br>pay for is the materials. But it also scoops the profit on the<br>materials, because under the name of Brookes & Scatterby it sells<br>itself the bricks, tiles, doors, window-frames, sand, cement, and,<br>I think, glass. And it wouldn't altogether surprise me to learn<br>that under yet another alias it sells itself the timber to make the<br>doors and window-frames. Also--and this was something which we<br>really might have foreseen, though it gave us all a knock when we<br>discovered it--the Cheerful Credit doesn't always keep to its end<br>of the bargain. When Ellesmere Road was built it gave on some open<br>fields--nothing very wonderful, but good for the kids to play in--<br>known as Platt's Meadows. There was nothing in black and white,<br>but it had always been understood that Platt's Meadows weren't to<br>be built on. However, West Bletchley was a growing suburb,<br>Rothwell's jam factory had opened in '28 and the Anglo-American<br>All-Steel Bicycle factory started in '33, and the population was<br>increasing and rents were going up. I've never seen Sir Herbert<br>Crum or any other of the big noises of the Cheerful Credit in the<br>flesh, but in my mind's eye I could see their mouths watering.<br>Suddenly the builders arrived and houses began to go up on Platt's<br>Meadows. There was a howl of agony from the Hesperides, and a<br>tenants' defence association was set up. No use! Crum's lawyers<br>had knocked the stuffing out of us in five minutes, and Platt's<br>Meadows were built over. But the really subtle swindle, the one<br>that makes me feel old Crum deserved his baronetcy, is the mental<br>one. Merely because of the illusion that we own our houses and<br>have what's called 'a stake in the country', we poor saps in the<br>Hesperides, and in all such places, are turned into Crum's devoted<br>slaves for ever. We're all respectable householders--that's to say<br>Tories, yes-men, and bumsuckers. Daren't kill the goose that lays<br>the gilded eggs! And the fact that actually we aren't householders,<br>that we're all in the middle of paying for our houses and eaten up<br>with the ghastly fear that something might happen before we've made<br>the last payment, merely increases the effect. We're all bought, and<br>what's more we're bought with our own money. Every one of those poor<br>downtrodden bastards, sweating his guts out to pay twice the proper<br>price for a brick doll's house that's called Belle Vue because<br>there's no view and the bell doesn't ring--every one of those poor<br>suckers would die on the field of battle to save his country from<br>Bolshevism.<br><br>I turned down Walpole Road and got into the High Street. There's a<br>train to London at 10.14. I was just passing the Sixpenny Bazaar<br>when I remembered the mental note I'd made that morning to buy a<br>packet of razor-blades. When I got to the soap counter the floor-<br>manager, or whatever his proper title is, was cursing the girl in<br>charge there. Generally there aren't many people in the Sixpenny<br>at that hour of the morning. Sometimes if you go in just after<br>opening-time you see all the girls lined up in a row and given<br>their morning curse, just to get them into trim for the day. They<br>say these big chain-stores have chaps with special powers of<br>sarcasm and abuse who are sent from branch to branch to ginger the<br>girls up. The floor-manager was an ugly little devil, under-sized,<br>with very square shoulders and a spiky grey moustache. He'd just<br>pounced on her about something, some mistake in the change<br>evidently, and was going for her with a voice like a circular saw.<br><br>'Ho, no! Course you couldn't count it! COURSE you couldn't. Too<br>much trouble, that'd be. Ho, no!'<br><br>Before I could stop myself I'd caught the girl's eye. It wasn't<br>so nice for her to have a fat middle-aged bloke with a red face<br>looking on while she took her cursing. I turned away as quickly as<br>I could and pretended to be interested in some stuff at the next<br>counter, curtain rings or something. He was on to her again. He<br>was one of those people who turn away and then suddenly dart back<br>at you, like a dragon-fly.<br><br>'COURSE you couldn't count it! Doesn't matter to YOU if we're two<br>bob out. Doesn't matter at all. What's two bob to YOU? Couldn't<br>ask YOU to go to the trouble of counting it properly. Ho, no!<br>Nothing matters 'ere 'cept YOUR convenience. You don't think about<br>others, do you?'<br><br>This went on for about five minutes in a voice you could hear half<br>across the shop. He kept turning away to make her think he'd<br>finished with her and then darting back to have another go. As I<br>edged a bit farther off I had a glance at them. The girl was a kid<br>about eighteen, rather fat, with a sort of moony face, the kind<br>that would never get the change right anyway. She'd turned pale<br>pink and she was wriggling, actually wriggling with pain. It was<br>just the same as if he'd been cutting into her with a whip. The<br>girls at the other counters were pretending not to hear. He was an<br>ugly, stiff-built little devil, the sort of cock-sparrow type of<br>man that sticks his chest out and puts his hands under his<br>coattails--the type that'd be a sergeant-major only they aren't<br>tall enough. Do you notice how often they have under-sized men for<br>these bullying jobs? He was sticking his face, moustaches and all,<br>almost into hers so as to scream at her better. And the girl all<br>pink and wriggling.<br><br>Finally he decided that he'd said enough and strutted off like an<br>admiral on the quarter-deck, and I came up to the counter for my<br>razor-blades. He knew I'd heard every word, and so did she, and<br>both of them knew I knew they knew. But the worst of it was that<br>for my benefit she'd got to pretend that nothing had happened and<br>put on the standoffish keep-your-distance attitude that a shopgirl's<br>supposed to keep up with male customers. Had to act the grown-up<br>young lady half a minute after I'd seen her cursed like a skivvy!<br>Her face was still pink and her hands were trembling. I asked her<br>for penny blades and she started fumbling in the threepenny tray.<br>Then the little devil of a floor-manager turned our way and for a<br>moment both of us thought he was coming back to begin again. The<br>girl flinched like a dog that sees the whip. But she was looking at<br>me out of the corner of her eye. I could see that because I'd seen<br>her cursed she hated me like the devil. Queer!<br><br>I cleared out with my razor-blades. Why do they stand it? I was<br>thinking. Pure funk, of course. One back-answer and you get the<br>sack. It's the same everywhere. I thought of the lad that<br>sometimes serves me at the chain-store grocery we deal at. A great<br>hefty lump of twenty, with cheeks like roses and enormous fore-<br>arms, ought to be working in a blacksmith's shop. And there he is<br>in his white jacket, bent double across the counter, rubbing his<br>hands together with his 'Yes, sir! Very true, sir! Pleasant<br>weather for the time of the year, sir! What can I have the<br>pleasure of getting you today, sir?' practically asking you to kick<br>his bum. Orders, of course. The customer is always right. The<br>thing you can see in his face is mortal dread that you might report<br>him for impertinence and get him sacked. Besides, how's he to know<br>you aren't one of the narks the company sends round? Fear! We<br>swim in it. It's our element. Everyone that isn't scared stiff of<br>losing his job is scared stiff of war, or Fascism, or Communism, or<br>something. Jews sweating when they think of Hitler. It crossed my<br>mind that that little bastard with the spiky moustache was probably<br>a damn sight more scared for his job than the girl was. Probably<br>got a family to support. And perhaps, who knows, at home he's meek<br>and mild, grows cucumbers in the back garden, lets his wife sit on<br>him and the kids pull his moustache. And by the same token you<br>never read about a Spanish Inquisitor or one of these higher-ups in<br>the Russian Ogpu without being told that in private life he was<br>such a good kind man, best of husbands and fathers, devoted to his<br>tame canary, and so forth.<br><br>The girl at the soap counter was looking after me as I went out of<br>the door. She'd have murdered me if she could. How she hated me<br>because of what I'd seen! Much more than she hated the floor-<br>manager. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/0.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/2.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
