<h2>Part 4, Chapter 4</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br>I drove back to the George, dumped the car in the garage, and had a<br>late cup of tea. As it was Sunday the bar wouldn't open for<br>another hour or two. In the cool of the evening I went out and<br>strolled up in the direction of the church.<br><br>I was just crossing the market-place when I noticed a woman walking<br>a little way ahead of me. As soon as I set eyes on her I had a<br>most peculiar feeling that I'd seen her somewhere before. You know<br>that feeling. I couldn't see her face, of course, and so far as<br>her back view went there was nothing I could identify and yet I<br>could have sworn I knew her.<br><br>She went up the High Street and turned down one of the side-streets<br>to the right, the one where Uncle Ezekiel used to have his shop. I<br>followed. I don't quite know why--partly curiosity, perhaps, and<br>partly as a kind of precaution. My first thought had been that<br>here at last was one of the people I'd known in the old days in<br>Lower Binfield, but almost at the same moment it struck me that it<br>was just as likely that she was someone from West Bletchley. In<br>that case I'd have to watch my step, because if she found out I was<br>here she'd probably split to Hilda. So I followed cautiously,<br>keeping at a safe distance and examining her back view as well as I<br>could. There was nothing striking about it. She was a tallish,<br>fattish woman, might have been forty or fifty, in a rather shabby<br>black dress. She'd no hat on, as though she'd just slipped out of<br>her house for a moment, and the way she walked gave you the<br>impression that her shoes were down at heel. All in all, she<br>looked a bit of a slut. And yet there was nothing to identify,<br>only that vague something which I knew I'd seen before. It was<br>something in her movements, perhaps. Presently she got to a little<br>sweet and paper shop, the kind of little shop that always keeps<br>open on a Sunday. The woman who kept it was standing in the<br>doorway, doing something to a stand of postcards. My woman stopped<br>to pass the time of day.<br><br>I stopped too, as soon as I could find a shop window which I could<br>pretend to be looking into. It was a plumber's and decorator's,<br>full of samples of wallpaper and bathroom fittings and things. By<br>this time I wasn't fifteen yards away from the other two. I could<br>hear their voices cooing away in one of those meaningless<br>conversations that women have when they're just passing the time of<br>day. 'Yes, that's jest about it. That's jest where it is. I said<br>to him myself, I said, "Well, what else do you expect?" I said. It<br>don't seem right, do it? But what's the use, you might as well<br>talk to a stone. It's a shame!' and so on and so forth. I was<br>getting warmer. Obviously my woman was a small shopkeeper's wife,<br>like the other. I was just wondering whether she mightn't be one<br>of the people I'd known in Lower Binfield after all, when she<br>turned almost towards me and I saw three-quarters of her face.<br>And Jesus Christ! It was Elsie!<br><br>Yes, it was Elsie. No chance of mistake. Elsie! That fat hag!<br><br>It gave me such a shock--not, mind you, seeing Elsie, but seeing<br>what she'd grown to be like--that for a moment things swam in front<br>of my eyes. The brass taps and ballstops and porcelain sinks and<br>things seemed to fade away into the distance, so that I both saw<br>them and didn't see them. Also for a moment I was in a deadly funk<br>that she might recognize me. But she'd looked bang in my face and<br>hadn't made any sign. A moment more, and she turned and went on.<br>Again I followed. It was dangerous, she might spot I was following<br>her, and that might start her wondering who I was, but I just had<br>to have another look at her. The fact was that she exercised a<br>kind of horrible fascination on me. In a manner of speaking I'd<br>been watching her before, but I watched her with quite different<br>eyes now.<br><br>It was horrible, and yet I got a kind of scientific kick out of<br>studying her back view. It's frightening, the things that twenty-<br>four years can do to a woman. Only twenty-four years, and the girl<br>I'd known, with her milky-white skin and red mouth and kind of<br>dull-gold hair, had turned into this great round-shouldered hag,<br>shambling along on twisted heels. It made me feel downright glad<br>I'm a man. No man ever goes to pieces quite so completely as that.<br>I'm fat, I grant you. I'm the wrong shape, if you like. But at<br>least I'm A shape. Elsie wasn't even particularly fat, she was<br>merely shapeless. Ghastly things had happened to her hips. As for<br>her waist, it had vanished. She was just a kind of soft lumpy<br>cylinder, like a bag of meal.<br><br>I followed her a long way, out of the old town and through a lot of<br>mean little streets I didn't know. Finally she turned in at the<br>doorway of another shop. By the way she went in, it was obviously<br>her own. I stopped for a moment outside the window. 'G. Cookson,<br>Confectioner and Tobacconist.' So Elsie was Mrs Cookson. It was<br>a mangy little shop, much like the other one where she'd stopped<br>before, but smaller and a lot more flyblown. Didn't seem to sell<br>anything except tobacco and the cheapest kinds of sweets. I<br>wondered what I could buy that would take a minute or two. Then I<br>saw a rack of cheap pipes in the window, and I went in. I had to<br>brace my nerve up a little before I did it, because there'd need to<br>be some hard lying if by any chance she recognized me.<br><br>She'd disappeared into the room behind the shop, but she came back<br>as I tapped on the counter. So we were face to face. Ah! no sign.<br>Didn't recognize me. Just looked at me the way they do. You know<br>the way small shopkeepers look at their customers--utter lack of<br>interest.<br><br>It was the first time I'd seen her full face, and though I half<br>expected what I saw, it gave me almost as big a shock as that first<br>moment when I'd recognized her. I suppose when you look at the<br>face of someone young, even of a child, you ought to be able to<br>foresee what it'll look like when it's old. It's all a question of<br>the shape of the bones. But if it had ever occurred to me, when I<br>was twenty and she was twenty-two, to wonder what Elsie would look<br>like at forty-seven, it wouldn't have crossed my mind that she<br>could ever look like THAT. The whole face had kind of sagged, as<br>if it had somehow been drawn downwards. Do you know that type of<br>middle-aged woman that has a face just like a bulldog? Great<br>underhung jaw, mouth turned down at the corners, eyes sunken, with<br>pouches underneath. Exactly like a bulldog. And yet it was the<br>same face, I'd have known it in a million. Her hair wasn't<br>completely grey, it was a kind of dirty colour, and there was much<br>less of it than there used to be. She didn't know me from Adam.<br>I was just a customer, a stranger, an uninteresting fat man. It's<br>queer what an inch or two of fat can do. I wondered whether I'd<br>changed even more than she had, or whether it was merely that she<br>wasn't expecting to see me, or whether--what was the likeliest of<br>all--she's simply forgotten my existence.<br><br>'Devening,' she said, in that listless way they have.<br><br>'I want a pipe,' I said flatly. 'A briar pipe.'<br><br>'A pipe. Now jest lemme see. I know we gossome pipes somewhere.<br>Now where did I--ah! 'Ere we are.'<br><br>She took a cardboard box full of pipes from somewhere under the<br>counter. How bad her accent had got! Or maybe I was just<br>imagining that, because my own standards had changed? But no, she<br>used to be so 'superior', all the girls at Lilywhite's were so<br>'superior', and she'd been a member of the vicar's Reading Circle.<br>I swear she never used to drop her aitches. It's queer how these<br>women go to pieces once they're married. I fiddled among the pipes<br>for a moment and pretended to look them over. Finally I said I'd<br>like one with an amber mouthpiece.<br><br>'Amber? I don't know as we got any--' she turned towards the back<br>of the shop and called: 'Ge-orge!'<br><br>So the other bloke's name was George too. A noise that sounded<br>something like 'Ur!' came from the back of the shop.<br><br>'Ge-orge! Where ju put that other box of pipes?'<br><br>George came in. He was a small stoutish chap, in shirtsleeves,<br>with a bald head and a big gingery-coloured soupstrainer moustache.<br>His jaw was working in a ruminative kind of way. Obviously he'd<br>been interrupted in the middle of his tea. The two of them started<br>poking round in search of the other box of pipes. It was about<br>five minutes before they ran it to earth behind some bottles of<br>sweets. It's wonderful, the amount of litter they manage to<br>accumulate in these frowsy little shops where the whole stock is<br>worth about fifty quid.<br><br>I watched old Elsie poking about among the litter and mumbling to<br>herself. Do you know the kind of shuffling, round-shouldered<br>movements of an old woman who's lost something? No use trying to<br>describe to you what I felt. A kind of cold, deadly desolate<br>feeling. You can't conceive it unless you've had it. All I can<br>say is, if there was a girl you used to care about twenty-five<br>years ago, go and have a look at her now. Then perhaps you'll know<br>what I felt.<br><br>But as a matter of fact, the thought that was chiefly in my mind<br>was how differently things turn out from what you expect. The<br>times I'd had with Elsie! The July nights under the chestnut<br>trees! Wouldn't you think it would leave some kind of after-effect<br>behind? Who'd have thought the time would ever come when there<br>would be just no feeling whatever between us? Here was I and here<br>was she, our bodies might be a yard apart, and we were just as much<br>strangers as though we'd never met. As for her, she didn't even<br>recognize me. If I told her who I was, very likely she wouldn't<br>remember. And if she did remember, what would she feel? Just<br>nothing. Probably wouldn't even be angry because I'd done the<br>dirty on her. It was as if the whole thing had never happened.<br><br>And on the other hand, who'd ever have foreseen that Elsie would<br>end up like this? She'd seemed the kind of girl who's bound to go<br>to the devil. I know there'd been at least one other man before I<br>had met her, and it's safe to bet there were others between me and<br>the second George. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that she'd had<br>a dozen altogether. I treated her badly, there's no question about<br>that, and many a time it had given me a bad half-hour. She'll end<br>up on the streets, I used to think, or stick her head in the gas<br>oven. And sometimes I felt I'd been a bit of a bastard, but other<br>times I reflected (what was true enough) that if it hadn't been me<br>it would have been somebody else. But you see the way things<br>happen, the kind of dull pointless way. How many women really end<br>up on the streets? A damn sight more end up at the mangle. She<br>hadn't gone to the bad, or to the good either. Just ended up like<br>everybody else, a fat old woman muddling about a frowsy little<br>shop, with a gingery-moustached George to call her own. Probably<br>got a string of kids as well. Mrs George Cookson. Lived respected<br>and died lamented--and might die this side of the bankruptcy-court,<br>if she was lucky.<br><br>They'd found the box of pipes. Of course there weren't any with<br>amber mouthpieces among them.<br><br>'I don't know as we got any amber ones just at present, sir. Not<br>amber. We gossome nice vulcanite ones.'<br><br>'I wanted an amber one,' I said.<br><br>'We gossome nice pipes 'ere.' She held one out. 'That's a nice<br>pipe, now. 'Alf a crown, that one is.'<br><br>I took it. Our fingers touched. No kick, no reaction. The body<br>doesn't remember. And I suppose you think I bought the pipe, just<br>for old sake's sake, to put half a crown in Elsie's pocket. But<br>not a bit of it. I didn't want the thing. I don't smoke a pipe.<br>I'd merely been making a pretext to come into the shop. I turned<br>it over in my fingers and then put it down on the counter.<br><br>'Doesn't matter, I'll leave it,' I said. 'Give me a small<br>Players'.'<br><br>Had to buy something, after all that fuss. George the second, or<br>maybe the third or fourth, routed out a packet of Players', still<br>munching away beneath his moustache. I could see he was sulky<br>because I'd dragged him away from his tea for nothing. But it<br>seemed too damn silly to waste half a crown. I cleared out and<br>that was the last I ever saw of Elsie.<br><br>I went back to the George and had dinner. Afterwards I went out<br>with some vague idea of going to the pictures, if they were open,<br>but instead I landed up in one of the big noisy pubs in the new<br>part of the town. There I ran into a couple of chaps from<br>Staffordshire who were travelling in hardware, and we got talking<br>about the state of trade, and playing darts and drinking Guinness.<br>By closing time they were both so boozed that I had to take them<br>home in a taxi, and I was a bit under the weather myself, and the<br>next morning I woke up with a worse head than ever. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/19.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/21.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
