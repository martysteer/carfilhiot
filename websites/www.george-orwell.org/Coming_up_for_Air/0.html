<h2>Part 1, Chapter 1</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The idea really came to me the day I got my new false teeth.<br><br>I remember the morning well. At about a quarter to eight I'd<br>nipped out of bed and got into the bathroom just in time to shut<br>the kids out. It was a beastly January morning, with a dirty<br>yellowish-grey sky. Down below, out of the little square of<br>bathroom window, I could see the ten yards by five of grass, with<br>a privet hedge round it and a bare patch in the middle, that we call<br>the back garden. There's the same back garden, some privets, and<br>same grass, behind every house in Ellesmere Road. Only difference--<br>where there are no kids there's no bare patch in the middle.<br><br>I was trying to shave with a bluntish razor-blade while the water<br>ran into the bath. My face looked back at me out of the mirror,<br>and underneath, in a tumbler of water on the little shelf over the<br>washbasin, the teeth that belonged in the face. It was the<br>temporary set that Warner, my dentist, had given me to wear while<br>the new ones were being made. I haven't such a bad face, really.<br>It's one of those bricky-red faces that go with butter-coloured<br>hair and pale-blue eyes. I've never gone grey or bald, thank God,<br>and when I've got my teeth in I probably don't look my age, which<br>is forty-five.<br><br>Making a mental note to buy razor-blades, I got into the bath and<br>started soaping. I soaped my arms (I've got those kind of pudgy<br>arms that are freckled up to the elbow) and then took the back-<br>brush and soaped my shoulder-blades, which in the ordinary way I<br>can't reach. It's a nuisance, but there are several parts of my<br>body that I can't reach nowadays. The truth is that I'm inclined<br>to be a little bit on the fat side. I don't mean that I'm like<br>something in a sideshow at a fair. My weight isn't much over<br>fourteen stone, and last time I measured round my waist it was<br>either forty-eight or forty-nine, I forget which. And I'm not what<br>they call 'disgustingly' fat, I haven't got one of those bellies<br>that sag half-way down to the knees. It's merely that I'm a little<br>bit broad in the beam, with a tendency to be barrel-shaped. Do you<br>know the active, hearty kind of fat man, the athletic bouncing type<br>that's nicknamed Fatty or Tubby and is always the life and soul of<br>the party? I'm that type. 'Fatty' they mostly call me. Fatty<br>Bowling. George Bowling is my real name.<br><br>But at that moment I didn't feel like the life and soul of the<br>party. And it struck me that nowadays I nearly always do have a<br>morose kind of feeling in the early mornings, although I sleep well<br>and my digestion's good. I knew what it was, of course--it was<br>those bloody false teeth. The things were magnified by the water<br>in the tumbler, and they were grinning at me like the teeth in a<br>skull. It gives you a rotten feeling to have your gums meet, a<br>sort of pinched-up, withered feeling like when you've bitten into<br>a sour apple. Besides, say what you will, false teeth are a<br>landmark. When your last natural tooth goes, the time when you can<br>kid yourself that you're a Hollywood sheik, is definitely at an<br>end. And I was fat as well as forty-five. As I stood up to soap<br>my crutch I had a look at my figure. It's all rot about fat men<br>being unable to see their feet, but it's a fact that when I stand<br>upright I can only see the front halves of mine. No woman, I<br>thought as I worked the soap round my belly, will ever look twice<br>at me again, unless she's paid to. Not that at that moment I<br>particularly wanted any woman to look twice at me.<br><br>But it struck me that this morning there were reasons why I ought<br>to have been in a better mood. To begin with I wasn't working<br>today. The old car, in which I 'cover' my district (I ought to<br>tell you that I'm in the insurance business. The Flying<br>Salamander. Life, fire, burglary, twins, shipwreck--everything),<br>was temporarily in dock, and though I'd got to look in at the<br>London office to drop some papers, I was really taking the day off<br>to go and fetch my new false teeth. And besides, there was another<br>business that had been in and out of my mind for some time past.<br>This was that I had seventeen quid which nobody else had heard<br>about--nobody in the family, that is. It had happened this way.<br>A chap in our firm, Mellors by name, had got hold of a book called<br>Astrology applied to Horse-racing which proved that it's all a<br>question of influence of the planets on the colours the jockey is<br>wearing. Well, in some race or other there was a mare called<br>Corsair's Bride, a complete outsider, but her jockey's colour was<br>green, which it seemed was just the colour for the planets that<br>happened to be in the ascendant. Mellors, who was deeply bitten<br>with this astrology business, was putting several quid on the horse<br>and went down on his knees to me to do the same. In the end,<br>chiefly to shut him up, I risked ten bob, though I don't bet as a<br>general rule. Sure enough Corsair's Bride came home in a walk. I<br>forget the exact odds, but my share worked out at seventeen quid.<br>By a kind of instinct--rather queer, and probably indicating<br>another landmark in my life--I just quietly put the money in the<br>bank and said nothing to anybody. I'd never done anything of this<br>kind before. A good husband and father would have spent it on a<br>dress for Hilda (that's my wife) and boots for the kids. But I'd<br>been a good husband and father for fifteen years and I was<br>beginning to get fed up with it.<br><br>After I'd soaped myself all over I felt better and lay down in the<br>bath to think about my seventeen quid and what to spend it on. The<br>alternatives, it seemed to me, were either a week-end with a woman<br>or dribbling it quietly away on odds and ends such as cigars and<br>double whiskies. I'd just turned on some more hot water and was<br>thinking about women and cigars when there was a noise like a herd<br>of buffaloes coming down the two steps that lead to the bathroom.<br>It was the kids, of course. Two kids in a house the size of ours<br>is like a quart of beer in a pint mug. There was a frantic<br>stamping outside and then a yell of agony.<br><br>'Dadda! I wanna come in!'<br><br>'Well, you can't. Clear out!'<br><br>'But dadda! I wanna go somewhere!'<br><br>'Go somewhere else, then. Hop it. I'm having my bath.'<br><br>'Dad-DA! I wanna GO SOME--WHERE!'<br><br>No use! I knew the danger signal. The W.C. is in the bathroom--it<br>would be, of course, in a house like ours. I hooked the plug out<br>of the bath and got partially dry as quickly as I could. As I<br>opened the door, little Billy--my youngest, aged seven--shot past<br>me, dodging the smack which I aimed at his head. It was only when<br>I was nearly dressed and looking for a tie that I discovered that<br>my neck was still soapy.<br><br>It's a rotten thing to have a soapy neck. It gives you a disgusting<br>sticky feeling, and the queer thing is that, however carefully you<br>sponge it away, when you've once discovered that your neck is soapy<br>you feel sticky for the rest of the day. I went downstairs in a bad<br>temper and ready to make myself disagreeable.<br><br>Our dining-room, like the other dining-rooms in Ellesmere Road, is<br>a poky little place, fourteen feet by twelve, or maybe it's twelve<br>by ten, and the Japanese oak sideboard, with the two empty<br>decanters and the silver egg-stand that Hilda's mother gave us for<br>a wedding present, doesn't leave much room. Old Hilda was glooming<br>behind the teapot, in her usual state of alarm and dismay because<br>the News Chronicle had announced that the price of butter was going<br>up, or something. She hadn't lighted the gas-fire, and though the<br>windows were shut it was beastly cold. I bent down and put a match<br>to the fire, breathing rather loudly through my nose (bending<br>always makes me puff and blow) as a kind of hint to Hilda. She<br>gave me the little sidelong glance that she always gives me when<br>she thinks I'm doing something extravagant.<br><br>Hilda is thirty-nine, and when I first knew her she looked just<br>like a hare. So she does still, but she's got very thin and rather<br>wizened, with a perpetual brooding, worried look in her eyes, and<br>when she's more upset than usual she's got a trick of humping her<br>shoulders and folding her arms across her breast, like an old gypsy<br>woman over her fire. She's one of those people who get their main<br>kick in life out of foreseeing disasters. Only petty disasters,<br>of course. As for wars, earthquakes, plagues, famines, and<br>revolutions, she pays no attention to them. Butter is going up,<br>and the gas-bill is enormous, and the kids' boots are wearing out,<br>and there's another instalment due on the radio--that's Hilda's<br>litany. She gets what I've finally decided is a definite pleasure<br>out of rocking herself to and fro with her arms across her breast,<br>and glooming at me, 'But, George, it's very SERIOUS! I don't know<br>what we're going to DO! I don't know where the money's coming<br>from! You don't seem to realize how serious it IS!' and so on and<br>so forth. It's fixed firmly in her head that we shall end up in<br>the workhouse. The funny thing is that if we ever do get to the<br>workhouse Hilda won't mind it a quarter as much as I shall, in fact<br>she'll probably rather enjoy the feeling of security.<br><br>The kids were downstairs already, having washed and dressed at<br>lightning speed, as they always do when there's no chance to keep<br>anyone else out of the bathroom. When I got to the breakfast table<br>they were having an argument which went to the tune of 'Yes, you<br>did!' 'No, I didn't!' 'Yes, you did!' 'No, I didn't!' and looked<br>like going on for the rest of the morning, until I told them to<br>cheese it. There are only the two of them, Billy, aged seven, and<br>Lorna, aged eleven. It's a peculiar feeling that I have towards<br>the kids. A great deal of the time I can hardly stick the sight of<br>them. As for their conversation, it's just unbearable. They're at<br>that dreary bread-and-butter age when a kid's mind revolves round<br>things like rulers, pencil-boxes, and who got top marks in French.<br>At other times, especially when they're asleep, I have quite a<br>different feeling. Sometimes I've stood over their cots, on summer<br>evenings when it's light, and watched them sleeping, with their<br>round faces and their tow-coloured hair, several shades lighter<br>than mine, and it's given me that feeling you read about in the<br>Bible when it says your bowels yearn. At such times I feel that<br>I'm just a kind of dried-up seed-pod that doesn't matter twopence<br>and that my sole importance has been to bring these creatures into<br>the world and feed them while they're growing. But that's only at<br>moments. Most of the time my separate existence looks pretty<br>important to me, I feel that there's life in the old dog yet and<br>plenty of good times ahead, and the notion of myself as a kind of<br>tame dairy-cow for a lot of women and kids to chase up and down<br>doesn't appeal to me.<br><br>We didn't talk much at breakfast. Hilda was in her 'I don't know<br>what we're going to DO!' mood, partly owing to the price of butter<br>and partly because the Christmas holidays were nearly over and<br>there was still five pounds owing on the school fees for last term.<br>I ate my boiled egg and spread a piece of bread with Golden Crown<br>marmalade. Hilda will persist in buying the stuff. It's<br>fivepence-halfpenny a pound, and the label tells you, in the<br>smallest print the law allows, that it contains 'a certain<br>proportion of neutral fruit-juice'. This started me off, in the<br>rather irritating way I have sometimes, talking about neutral<br>fruit-trees, wondering what they looked like and what countries<br>they grew in, until finally Hilda got angry. It's not that she<br>minds me chipping her, it's only that in some obscure way she<br>thinks it's wicked to make jokes about anything you save money on.<br><br>I had a look at the paper, but there wasn't much news. Down in<br>Spain and over in China they were murdering one another as usual,<br>a woman's legs had been found in a railway waiting-room, and King<br>Zog's wedding was wavering in the balance. Finally, at about ten<br>o'clock, rather earlier than I'd intended, I started out for town.<br>The kids had gone off to play in the public gardens. It was a<br>beastly raw morning. As I stepped out of the front door a nasty<br>little gust of wind caught the soapy patch on my neck and made me<br>suddenly feel that my clothes didn't fit and that I was sticky all<br>over. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/1.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
