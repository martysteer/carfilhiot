<h2>Part 2, Chapter 10</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">I was living in a boarding-house in Ealing. The years were rolling<br>on, or crawling on. Lower Binfield had passed almost out of my<br>memory. I was the usual young city worker who scoots for the 8.15<br>and intrigues for the other fellow's job. I was fairly well<br>thought of in the firm and pretty satisfied with life. The post-<br>war success dope had caught me, more or less. You remember the<br>line of talk. Pep, punch, grit, sand. Get on or get out. There's<br>plenty of room at the top. You can't keep a good man down. And<br>the ads in the magazines about the chap that the boss clapped on<br>the shoulder, and the keen-jawed executive who's pulling down the<br>big dough and attributes his success to so and so's correspondence<br>course. It's funny how we all swallowed it, even blokes like me to<br>whom it hadn't the smallest application. Because I'm neither a go-<br>getter nor a down-and-out, and I'm by nature incapable of being<br>either. But it was the spirit of the time. Get on! Make good!<br>If you see a man down, jump on his guts before he gets up again.<br>Of course this was in the early twenties, when some of the effects<br>of the war had worn off and the slump hadn't yet arrived to knock<br>the stuffing out of us.<br><br>I had an 'A' subscription at Boots and went to half-crown dances<br>and belonged to a local tennis club. You know those tennis clubs<br>in the genteel suburbs--little wooden pavilions and high wire-<br>netting enclosures where young chaps in rather badly cut white<br>flannels prance up and down, shouting 'Fifteen forty!' and 'Vantage<br>all!' in voices which are a tolerable imitation of the Upper Crust.<br>I'd learned to play tennis, didn't dance too badly, and got on well<br>with the girls. At nearly thirty I wasn't a bad-looking chap, with<br>my red face and butter-coloured hair, and in those days it was<br>still a point in your favour to have fought in the war. I never,<br>then or at any other time, succeeded in looking like a gentleman,<br>but on the other hand you probably wouldn't have taken me for the<br>son of a small shopkeeper in a country town. I could keep my end<br>up in the rather mixed society of a place like Ealing, where the<br>office-employee class overlaps with the middling-professional<br>class. It was at the tennis club that I first met Hilda.<br><br>At that time Hilda was twenty-four. She was a small, slim, rather<br>timid girl, with dark hair, beautiful movements, and--because of<br>having very large eyes--a distinct resemblance to a hare. She was<br>one of those people who never say much, but remain on the edge of<br>any conversation that's going on, and give the impression that<br>they're listening. If she said anything at all, it was usually<br>'Oh, yes, I think so too', agreeing with whoever had spoken last.<br>At tennis she hopped about very gracefully, and didn't play badly,<br>but somehow had a helpless, childish air. Her surname was Vincent.<br><br>If you're married, there'll have been times when you've said to<br>yourself 'Why the hell did I do it?' and God knows I've said it<br>often enough about Hilda. And once again, looking at it across<br>fifteen years, why DID I marry Hilda?<br><br>Partly, of course, because she was young and in a way very pretty.<br>Beyond that I can only say that because she came of totally<br>different origins from myself it was very difficult for me to get<br>any grasp of what she was really like. I had to marry her first<br>and find out about her afterwards, whereas if I'd married say,<br>Elsie Waters, I'd have known what I was marrying. Hilda belonged<br>to a class I only knew by hearsay, the poverty-stricken officer<br>class. For generations past her family had been soldiers, sailors,<br>clergymen, Anglo-Indian officials, and that kind of thing. They'd<br>never had any money, but on the other hand none of them had ever<br>done anything that I should recognize as work. Say what you will,<br>there's a kind of snob-appeal in that, if you belong as I do to the<br>God-fearing shopkeeper class, the low church, and high-tea class.<br>It wouldn't make any impression on me now, but it did then. Don't<br>mistake what I'm saying. I don't mean that I married Hilda BECAUSE<br>she belonged to the class I'd once served across the counter, with<br>some notion of jockeying myself up in the social scale. It was<br>merely that I couldn't understand her and therefore was capable of<br>being goofy about her. And one thing I certainly didn't grasp was<br>that the girls in these penniless middle-class families will marry<br>anything in trousers, just to get away from home.<br><br>It wasn't long before Hilda took me home to see her family. I<br>hadn't known till then that there was a considerable Anglo-Indian<br>colony in Ealing. Talk about discovering a new world! It was<br>quite a revelation to me.<br><br>Do you know these Anglo-Indian families? It's almost impossible,<br>when you get inside these people's houses, to remember that out in<br>the street it's England and the twentieth century. As soon as you<br>set foot inside the front door you're in India in the eighties.<br>You know the kind of atmosphere. The carved teak furniture, the<br>brass trays, the dusty tiger-skulls on the wall, the Trichinopoly<br>cigars, the red-hot pickles, the yellow photographs of chaps in<br>sun-helmets, the Hindustani words that you're expected to know the<br>meaning of, the everlasting anecdotes about tiger-shoots and what<br>Smith said to Jones in Poona in '87. It's a sort of little world<br>of their own that they've created, like a kind of cyst. To me, of<br>course, it was all quite new and in some ways rather interesting.<br>Old Vincent, Hilda's father, had been not only in India but also in<br>some even more outlandish place, Borneo or Sarawak, I forget which.<br>He was the usual type, completely bald, almost invisible behind his<br>moustache, and full of stories about cobras and cummerbunds and<br>what the district collector said in '93. Hilda's mother was so<br>colourless that she was just like one of the faded photos on the<br>wall. There was also a son, Harold, who had some official job in<br>Ceylon and was home on leave at the time when I first met Hilda.<br>They had a little dark house in one of those buried back-streets<br>that exist in Ealing. It smelt perpetually of Trichinopoly cigars<br>and it was so full of spears, blow-pipes, brass ornaments, and the<br>heads of wild animals that you could hardly move about in it.<br><br>Old Vincent had retired in 1910, and since then he and his wife had<br>shown about as much activity, mental or physical, as a couple of<br>shellfish. But at the time I was vaguely impressed by a family<br>which had had majors, colonels, and once even an admiral in it.<br>My attitude towards the Vincents, and theirs towards me, is an<br>interesting illustration of what fools people can be when they get<br>outside their own line. Put me among business people--whether<br>they're company directors or commercial travellers--and I'm a<br>fairly good judge of character. But I had no experience whatever<br>of the officer-rentier-clergyman class, and I was inclined to kow-<br>tow to these decayed throw-outs. I looked on them as my social and<br>intellectual superiors, while they on the other hand mistook me for<br>a rising young businessman who before long would be pulling down<br>the big dough. To people of that kind, 'business', whether it's<br>marine insurance or selling peanuts, is just a dark mystery. All<br>they know is that it's something rather vulgar out of which you can<br>make money. Old Vincent used to talk impressively about my being<br>'in business'--once, I remember, he had a slip of the tongue and<br>said 'in trade'--and obviously didn't grasp the difference between<br>being in business as an employee and being there on your own<br>account. He had some vague notion that as I was 'in' the Flying<br>Salamander I should sooner or later rise to the top of it, by a<br>process of promotion. I think it's possible that he also had<br>pictures of himself touching me for fivers at some future date.<br>Harold certainly had. I could see it in his eye. In fact, even<br>with my income being what it is, I'd probably be lending money to<br>Harold at this moment if he were alive. Luckily he died a few<br>years after we were married, of enteric or something, and both the<br>old Vincents are dead too.<br><br>Well, Hilda and I were married, and right from the start it was a<br>flop. Why did you marry her? you say. But why did you marry<br>yours? These things happen to us. I wonder whether you'll believe<br>that during the first two or three years I had serious thoughts of<br>killing Hilda. Of course in practice one never does these things,<br>they're only a kind of fantasy that one enjoys thinking about.<br>Besides, chaps who murder their wives always get copped. However<br>cleverly you've faked the alibi, they know perfectly well that it's<br>you who did it, and they'll pin it on to you somehow. When a<br>woman's bumped off, her husband is always the first suspect--which<br>gives you a little side-glimpse of what people really think about<br>marriage.<br><br>One gets used to everything in time. After a year or two I stopped<br>wanting to kill her and started wondering about her. Just<br>wondering. For hours, sometimes, on Sunday afternoons or in the<br>evening when I've come home from work, I've lain on my bed with all<br>my clothes on except my shoes, wondering about women. Why they're<br>like that, how they get like that, whether they're doing it on<br>purpose. It seems to be a most frightful thing, the suddenness<br>with which some women go to pieces after they're married. It's as<br>if they were strung up to do just that one thing, and the instant<br>they've done it they wither off like a flower that's set its seed.<br>What really gets me down is the dreary attitude towards life that<br>it implies. If marriage was just an open swindle--if the woman<br>trapped you into it and then turned round and said, 'Now, you<br>bastard, I've caught you and you're going to work for me while I<br>have a good time!'--I wouldn't mind so much. But not a bit of it.<br>They don't want to have a good time, they merely want to slump into<br>middle age as quickly as possible. After the frightful battle of<br>getting her man to the altar, the woman kind of relaxes, and all<br>her youth, looks, energy, and joy of life just vanish overnight.<br>It was like that with Hilda. Here was this pretty, delicate girl,<br>who'd seemed to me--and in fact when I first knew her she WAS--a<br>finer type of animal than myself, and within only about three years<br>she'd settled down into a depressed, lifeless, middle-aged frump.<br>I'm not denying that I was part of the reason. But whoever she'd<br>married it would have been much the same.<br><br>What Hilda lacks--I discovered this about a week after we were<br>married--is any kind of joy in life, any kind of interest in things<br>for their own sake. The idea of doing things because you enjoy<br>them is something she can hardly understand. It was through Hilda<br>that I first got a notion of what these decayed middle-class<br>families are really like. The essential fact about them is that<br>all their vitality has been drained away by lack of money. In<br>families like that, which live on tiny pensions and annuities--<br>that's to say on incomes which never get bigger and generally get<br>smaller--there's more sense of poverty, more crust-wiping, and<br>looking twice at sixpence, than you'd find in any farm-labourer's<br>family, let alone a family like mine. Hilda's often told me that<br>almost the first thing she can remember is a ghastly feeling that<br>there was never enough money for anything. Of course, in that kind<br>of family, the lack of money is always at its worst when the kids<br>are at the school-age. Consequently they grow up, especially the<br>girls, with a fixed idea not only that one always IS hard-up but<br>that it's one's duty to be miserable about it.<br><br>At the beginning we lived in a poky little maisonette and had a job<br>to get by on my wages. Later, when I was transferred to the West<br>Bletchley branch, things were better, but Hilda's attitude didn't<br>change. Always that ghastly glooming about money! The milk bill!<br>The coal bill! The rent! The school fees! We've lived all our<br>life together to the tune of 'Next week we'll be in the workhouse.'<br>It's not that Hilda's mean, in the ordinary sense of the word, and<br>still less that she's selfish. Even when there happens to be a bit<br>of spare cash knocking about I can hardly persuade her to buy<br>herself any decent clothes. But she's got this feeling that you<br>OUGHT to be perpetually working yourself up into a stew about lack<br>of money. Just working up an atmosphere of misery from a sense of<br>duty. I'm not like that. I've got more the prole's attitude<br>towards money. Life's here to be lived, and if we're going to be<br>in the soup next week--well, next week is a long way off. What<br>really shocks her is the fact that I refuse to worry. She's always<br>going for me about it. 'But, George! You don't seem to REALIZE!<br>We've simply got no money at all! It's very SERIOUS!' She loves<br>getting into a panic because something or other is 'serious'. And<br>of late she's got that trick, when she's glooming about something,<br>of kind of hunching her shoulders and folding her arms across her<br>breast. If you made a list of Hilda's remarks throughout the day,<br>you'd find three bracketed together at the top--'We can't afford<br>it', 'It's a great saving', and 'I don't know where the money's to<br>come from'. She does everything for negative reasons. When she<br>makes a cake she's not thinking about the cake, only about how to<br>save butter and eggs. When I'm in bed with her all she thinks<br>about is how not to have a baby. If she goes to the pictures she's<br>all the time writhing with indignation about the price of the<br>seats. Her methods of housekeeping, with all the emphasis on<br>'using things up' and 'making things do', would have given Mother<br>convulsions. On the other hand, Hilda isn't in the least a snob.<br>She's never looked down on me because I'm not a gentleman. On the<br>contrary, from her point of view I'm much too lordly in my habits.<br>We never have a meal in a tea-shop without a frightful row in<br>whispers because I'm tipping the waitress too much. And it's a<br>curious thing that in the last few years she's become much more<br>definitely lower-middle-class, in outlook and even in appearance,<br>than I am. Of course all this 'saving' business has never led to<br>anything. It never does. We live just about as well or as badly<br>as the other people in Ellesmere Road. But the everlasting stew<br>about the gas bill and the milk bill and the awful price of butter<br>and the kids' boots and school-fees goes on and on. It's a kind of<br>game with Hilda.<br><br>We moved to West Bletchley in '29 and started buying the house in<br>Ellesmere Road the next year, a little before Billy was born.<br>After I was made an Inspector I was more away from home and had<br>more opportunities with other women. Of course I was unfaithful--<br>I won't say all the time, but as often as I got the chance.<br>Curiously enough, Hilda was jealous. In a way, considering how<br>little that kind of thing means to her, I wouldn't have expected<br>her to mind. And like all jealous women she'll sometimes show a<br>cunning you wouldn't think her capable of. Sometimes the way she's<br>caught me out would have made me believe in telepathy, if it wasn't<br>that she's often been equally suspicious when I didn't happen to be<br>guilty. I'm more or less permanently under suspicion, though, God<br>knows, in the last few years--the last five years, anyway--I've<br>been innocent enough. You have to be, when you're as fat as I am.<br><br>Taking it by and large, I suppose Hilda and I don't get on worse<br>than about half the couples in Ellesmere Road. There've been times<br>when I've thought of separation or divorce, but in our walk of life<br>you don't do those things. You can't afford to. And then time<br>goes on, and you kind of give up struggling. When you've lived<br>with a woman for fifteen years, it's difficult to imagine life<br>without her. She's part of the order of things. I dare say you<br>might find things to object to in the sun and the moon, but do you<br>really want to change them? Besides, there were the kids. Kids<br>are a 'link', as they say. Or a 'tie'. Not to say a ball and<br>fetter.<br><br>Of late years Hilda has made two great friends called Mrs Wheeler<br>and Miss Minns. Mrs Wheeler is a widow, and I gather she's got<br>very bitter ideas about the male sex. I can feel her kind of<br>quivering with disapproval if I so much as come into the room.<br>She's a faded little woman and gives you a curious impression that<br>she's the same colour all over, a kind of greyish dust-colour, but<br>she's full of energy. She's a bad influence on Hilda, because<br>she's got the same passion for 'saving' and 'making things do',<br>though in a slightly different form. With her it takes the form<br>of thinking that you can have a good time without paying for it.<br>She's for ever nosing out bargains and amusements that don't cost<br>money. With people like that it doesn't matter a damn whether they<br>want a thing or not, it's merely a question of whether they can get<br>it on the cheap. When the big shops have their remnant sales Mrs<br>Wheeler's always at the head of the queue, and it's her greatest<br>pride, after a day's hard fighting round the counter, to come out<br>without having bought anything. Miss Minns is quite a different<br>sort. She's really a sad case, poor Miss Minns. She's a tall thin<br>woman of about thirty-eight, with black patent-leather hair and a<br>very GOOD, trusting kind of face. She lives on some kind of tiny<br>fixed income, an annuity or something, and I fancy she's a left-<br>over from the old society of West Bletchley, when it was a little<br>country town, before the suburb grew up. It's written all over her<br>that her father was a clergyman and sat on her pretty heavily while<br>he lived. They're a special by-product of the middle classes,<br>these women who turn into withered bags before they even manage to<br>escape from home. Poor old Miss Minns, for all her wrinkles, still<br>looks exactly like a child. It's still a tremendous adventure to<br>her not to go to church. She's always burbling about 'modern<br>progress' and 'the woman's movement', and she's got a vague<br>yearning to do something she calls 'developing her mind', only she<br>doesn't quite know how to start. I think in the beginning she<br>cottoned on to Hilda and Mrs Wheeler out of pure loneliness, but<br>now they take her with them wherever they go.<br><br>And the times they've had together, those three! Sometimes I've<br>almost envied them. Mrs Wheeler is the leading spirit. You<br>couldn't name a kind of idiocy that she hasn't dragged them into at<br>one time or another. Anything from theosophy to cat's-cradle,<br>provided you can do it on the cheap. For months they went in for<br>the food-crank business. Mrs Wheeler had picked up a second-hand<br>copy of some book called Radiant Energy which proved that you<br>should live on lettuces and other things that don't cost money.<br>Of course this appealed to Hilda, who immediately began starving<br>herself. She'd have tried it on me and the kids as well, only I<br>put my foot down. Then they had a go at faith-healing. Then they<br>thought of tackling Pelmanism, but after a lot of correspondence<br>they found that they couldn't get the booklets free, which had been<br>Mrs Wheeler's idea. Then it was hay-box cookery. Then it was some<br>filthy stuff called bee wine, which was supposed to cost nothing at<br>all because you made it out of water. They dropped that after<br>they'd read an article in the paper saying that bee wine gives you<br>cancer. Then they nearly joined one of those women's clubs which<br>go for conducted tours round factories, but after a lot of<br>arithmetic Mrs Wheeler decided that the free teas the factories<br>gave you didn't quite equal the subscription. Then Mrs Wheeler<br>scraped acquaintance with somebody who gave away free tickets for<br>plays produced by some stage society or other. I've known the<br>three of them sit for hours listening to some highbrow play of<br>which they didn't even pretend to understand a word--couldn't even<br>tell you the name of the play afterwards--but they felt that they<br>were getting something for nothing. Once they even took up<br>spiritualism. Mrs Wheeler had run across some down-and-out medium<br>who was so desperate that he'd give seances for eighteenpence, so<br>that the three of them could have a glimpse beyond the veil for a<br>tanner a time. I saw him once when he came to give a seance at our<br>house. He was a seedy-looking old devil and obviously in mortal<br>terror of D.T.s. He was so shaky that when he was taking his<br>overcoat off in the hall he had a sort of spasm and a hank of<br>butter-muslin dropped out of his trouser-leg. I managed to shove<br>it back to him before the women saw. Butter-muslin is what they<br>make the ectoplasm with, so I'm told. I suppose he was going on to<br>another seance afterwards. You don't get manifestations for<br>eighteen pence. Mrs Wheeler's biggest find of the last few years<br>is the Left Book Club. I think it was in '36 that the news of the<br>Left Book Club got to West Bletchley. I joined it soon afterwards,<br>and it's almost the only time I can remember spending money without<br>Hilda protesting. She can see some sense in buying a book when<br>you're getting it for a third of its proper price. These women's<br>attitude is curious, really. Miss Minns certainly had a try at<br>reading one or two of the books, but this wouldn't even have<br>occurred to the other two. They've never had any direct connexion<br>with the Left Book Club or any notion what it's all about--in fact<br>I believe at the beginning Mrs Wheeler thought it had something to<br>do with books which had been left in railway carriages and were<br>being sold off cheap. But they do know that it means seven and<br>sixpenny books for half a crown, and so they're always saying that<br>it's 'such a good idea'. Now and again the local Left Book Club<br>branch holds meetings and gets people down to speak, and Mrs<br>Wheeler always takes the others along. She's a great one for<br>public meetings of any kind, always provided that it's indoors and<br>admission free. The three of them sit there like lumps of pudding.<br>They don't know what the meeting's about and they don't care, but<br>they've got a vague feeling, especially Miss Minns, that they're<br>improving their minds, and it isn't costing them anything.<br><br>Well, that's Hilda. You see what she's like. Take it by and<br>large, I suppose she's no worse than I am. Sometimes when we were<br>first married I felt I'd like to strangle her, but later I got so<br>that I didn't care. And then I got fat and settled down. It must<br>have been in 1930 that I got fat. It happened so suddenly that it<br>was as if a cannon ball had hit me and got stuck inside. You know<br>how it is. One night you go to bed, still feeling more or less<br>young, with an eye for the girls and so forth, and next morning you<br>wake up in the full consciousness that you're just a poor old fatty<br>with nothing ahead of you this side the grave except sweating your<br>guts out to buy boots for the kids.<br><br>And now it's '38, and in every shipyard in the world they're<br>riveting up the battleships for another war, and a name I chanced<br>to see on a poster had stirred up in me a whole lot of stuff which<br>ought to have been buried God knows how many years ago. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/12.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/14.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
