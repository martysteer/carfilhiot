<h2>Part 4, Chapter 3</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">I crawled out of bed with a bad taste in my mouth and my bones<br>creaking.<br><br>The fact was that, what with a bottle of wine at lunch and another<br>at dinner, and several pints in between, besides a brandy or two,<br>I'd had a bit too much to drink the day before. For several<br>minutes I stood in the middle of the carpet, gazing at nothing in<br>particular and too done-in to make a move. You know that god-awful<br>feeling you get sometimes in the early morning. It's a feeling<br>chiefly in your legs, but it says to you clearer than any words<br>could do, 'Why the hell do you go on with it? Chuck it up, old<br>chap! Stick your head in the gas oven!'<br><br>Then I shoved my teeth in and went to the window. A lovely June<br>day, again, and the sun was just beginning to slant over the roofs<br>and hit the house-fronts on the other side of the street. The pink<br>geraniums in the window-boxes didn't look half bad. Although it<br>was only about half past eight and this was only a side-street off<br>the market-place there was quite a crowd of people coming and<br>going. A stream of clerkly-looking chaps in dark suits with<br>dispatch-cases were hurrying along, all in the same direction, just<br>as if this had been a London suburb and they were scooting for the<br>Tube, and the schoolkids were straggling up towards the market-<br>place in twos and threes. I had the same feeling that I'd had the<br>day before when I saw the jungle of red houses that had swallowed<br>Chamford Hill. Bloody interlopers! Twenty thousand gate-crashers<br>who didn't even know my name. And here was all this new life<br>swarming to and fro, and here was I, a poor old fatty with false<br>teeth, watching them from a window and mumbling stuff that nobody<br>wanted to listen to about things that happened thirty and forty<br>years ago. Christ! I thought, I was wrong to think that I was<br>seeing ghosts. I'm the ghost myself. I'm dead and they're alive.<br><br>But after breakfast--haddock, grilled kidneys, toast and marmalade,<br>and a pot of coffee--I felt better. The frozen dame wasn't<br>breakfasting in the dining-room, there was a nice summery feeling<br>in the air, and I couldn't get rid of the feeling that in that blue<br>flannel suit of mine I looked just a little bit distingue. By God!<br>I thought, if I'm a ghost, I'll BE a ghost! I'll walk. I'll haunt<br>the old places. And maybe I can work a bit of black magic on some<br>of these bastards who've stolen my home town from me.<br><br>I started out, but I'd got no farther than the market-place when I<br>was pulled up by something I hadn't expected to see. A procession<br>of about fifty school-kids was marching down the street in column<br>of fours--quite military, they looked--with a grim-looking woman<br>marching alongside of them like a sergeant-major. The leading four<br>were carrying a banner with a red, white, and blue border and<br>BRITONS PREPARE on it in huge letters. The barber on the corner<br>had come out on to his doorstep to have a look at them. I spoke to<br>him. He was a chap with shiny black hair and a dull kind of face.<br><br>'What are those kids doing?'<br><br>'It's this here air-raid practice,' he said vaguely. 'This here<br>A.R.P. Kind of practising, like. That's Miss Todgers, that is.'<br><br>I might have guessed it was Miss Todgers. You could see it in her<br>eye. You know the kind of tough old devil with grey hair and a<br>kippered face that's always put in charge of Girl Guide<br>detachments, Y.W.C.A. hostels, and whatnot. She had on a coat and<br>skirt that somehow looked like a uniform and gave you a strong<br>impression that she was wearing a Sam Browne belt, though actually<br>she wasn't. I knew her type. Been in the W.A.A.C.s in the war,<br>and never had a day's fun since. This A.R.P. was jam to her. As<br>the kids swung past I heard her letting out at them with the real<br>sergeant-major yell, 'Monica! Lift your feet up!' and I saw that<br>the rear four had another banner with a red, white, and blue<br>border, and in the middle<br><br><br>WE ARE READY. ARE YOU?<br><br><br>'What do they want to march them up and down for?' I said to the<br>barber.<br><br>'I dunno. I s'pose it's kind of propaganda, like.'<br><br>I knew, of course. Get the kids war-minded. Give us all the<br>feeling that there's no way out of it, the bombers are coming as<br>sure as Christmas, so down to the cellar you go and don't argue.<br>Two of the great black planes from Walton were zooming over the<br>eastern end of the town. Christ! I thought, when it starts it<br>won't surprise us any more than a shower of rain. Already we're<br>listening for the first bomb. The barber went on to tell me that<br>thanks to Miss Todgers's efforts the school-kids had been served<br>with their gas-masks already.<br><br>Well, I started to explore the town. Two days I spent just<br>wandering round the old landmarks, such of them as I could<br>identify. And all that time I never ran across a soul that knew<br>me. I was a ghost, and if I wasn't actually invisible, I felt like<br>it.<br><br>It was queer, queerer than I can tell you. Did you ever read a<br>story of H.G. Wells's about a chap who was in two places at once--<br>that's to say, he was really in his own home, but he had a kind of<br>hallucination that he was at the bottom of the sea? He'd been<br>walking round his room, but instead of the tables and chairs he'd<br>see the wavy waterweed and the great crabs and cuttlefish reaching<br>out to get him. Well, it was just like that. For hours on end I'd<br>be walking through a world that wasn't there. I'd count my paces<br>as I went down the pavement and think, 'Yes, here's where so-and-<br>so's field begins. The hedge runs across the street and slap<br>through that house. That petrol pump is really an elm tree. And<br>here's the edge of the allotments. And this street (it was a<br>dismal little row of semi-detached houses called Cumberledge Road,<br>I remember) is the lane where we used to go with Katie Simmons, and<br>the nut-bushes grew on both sides.' No doubt I got the distances<br>wrong, but the general directions were right. I don't believe<br>anyone who hadn't happened to be born here would have believed that<br>these streets were fields as little as twenty years ago. It was as<br>though the countryside had been buried by a kind of volcanic<br>eruption from the outer suburbs. Nearly the whole of what used to<br>be old Brewer's land had been swallowed up in the Council housing<br>estate. The Mill Farm had vanished, the cow-pond where I caught my<br>first fish had been drained and filled up and built over, so that I<br>couldn't even say exactly where it used to stand. It was all<br>houses, houses, little red cubes of houses all alike, with privet<br>hedges and asphalt paths leading up to the front door. Beyond the<br>Council Estate the town thinned out a bit, but the jerry-builders<br>were doing their best. And there were little knots of houses<br>dumped here and there, wherever anybody had been able to buy a plot<br>of land, and the makeshift roads leading up to the houses, and<br>empty lots with builders' boards, and bits of ruined fields covered<br>with thistles and tin cans.<br><br>In the centre of the old town, on the other hand, things hadn't<br>changed much, so far as buildings went. A lot of the shops were<br>still doing the same line of trade, although the names were<br>different. Lillywhite's was still a draper's, but it didn't look<br>too prosperous. What used to be Gravitt's, the butcher's, was now<br>a shop that sold radio parts. Mother Wheeler's little window had<br>been bricked over. Grimmett's was still a grocer's, but it had<br>been taken over by the International. It gives you an idea of the<br>power of these big combines that they could even swallow up a cute<br>old skinflint like Grimmett. But from what I know of him--not to<br>mention that slap-up tombstone in the churchyard--I bet he got out<br>while the going was good and had ten to fifteen thousand quid to<br>take to heaven with him. The only shop that was still in the same<br>hands was Sarazins', the people who'd ruined Father. They'd<br>swollen to enormous dimensions, and they had another huge branch in<br>the new part of the town. But they'd turned into a kind of general<br>store and sold furniture, drugs, hardware, and ironmongery as well<br>as the old garden stuff.<br><br>For the best part of two days I was wandering round, not actually<br>groaning and rattling a chain, but sometimes feeling that I'd like<br>to. Also I was drinking more than was good for me. Almost as soon<br>as I got to Lower Binfield I'd started on the booze, and after that<br>the pubs never seemed to open quite early enough. My tongue was<br>always hanging out of my mouth for the last half-hour before<br>opening time.<br><br>Mind you, I wasn't in the same mood all the time. Sometimes it<br>seemed to me that it didn't matter a damn if Lower Binfield had<br>been obliterated. After all, what had I come here for, except to<br>get away from the family? There was no reason why I shouldn't do<br>all the things I wanted to do, even go fishing if I felt like it.<br>On the Saturday afternoon I even went to the fishing-tackle shop in<br>the High Street and bought a split-cane rod (I'd always pined for a<br>split-cane rod as a boy--it's a little bit dearer than a green-<br>heart) and hooks and gut and so forth. The atmosphere of the shop<br>cheered me up. Whatever else changes, fishing-tackle doesn't--<br>because, of course, fish don't change either. And the shopman<br>didn't see anything funny in a fat middle-aged man buying a<br>fishing-rod. On the contrary, we had a little talk about the<br>fishing in the Thames and the big chub somebody had landed the year<br>before last on a paste made of brown bread, honey, and minced<br>boiled rabbit. I even--though I didn't tell him what I wanted them<br>for, and hardly even admitted it to myself--bought the strongest<br>salmon trace he'd got, and some No. 5 roach-hooks, with an eye to<br>those big carp at Binfield House, in case they still existed.<br><br>Most of Sunday morning I was kind of debating it in my mind--should<br>I go fishing, or shouldn't I? One moment I'd think, why the hell<br>not, and the next moment it would seem to me that it was just one<br>of those things that you dream about and don't ever do. But in the<br>afternoon I got the car out and drove down to Burford Weir. I<br>thought I'd just have a look at the river, and tomorrow, if the<br>weather was right, maybe I'd take my new fishing-rod and put on the<br>old coat and grey flannel bags I had in my suitcase, and have a<br>good day's fishing. Three or four days, if I felt like it.<br><br>I drove over Chamford Hill. Down at the bottom the road turns off<br>and runs parallel to the towpath. I got out of the car and walked.<br>Ah! A knot of little red and white bungalows had sprung up beside<br>the road. Might have expected it, of course. And there seemed to<br>be a lot of cars standing about. As I got nearer the river I came<br>into the sound--yes, plonk-tiddle-tiddle-plonk!--yes, the sound of<br>gramphones.<br><br>I rounded the bend and came in sight of the towpath. Christ!<br>Another jolt. The place was black with people. And where the<br>water-meadows used to be--tea-houses, penny-in-the-slot machines,<br>sweet kiosks, and chaps selling Walls' Ice-Cream. Might as well<br>have been at Margate. I remember the old towpath. You could walk<br>along it for miles, and except for the chaps at the lock gates, and<br>now and again a bargeman mooching along behind his horse, you'd<br>meet never a soul. When we went fishing we always had the place to<br>ourselves. Often I've sat there a whole afternoon, and a heron<br>might be standing in the shallow water fifty yards up the bank, and<br>for three or four hours on end there wouldn't be anyone passing to<br>scare him away. But where had I got the idea that grown-up men<br>don't go fishing? Up and down the bank, as far as I could see in<br>both directions, there was a continuous chain of men fishing, one<br>every five yards. I wondered how the hell they could all have got<br>there until it struck me that they must be some fishing-club or<br>other. And the river was crammed with boats--rowing-boats, canoes,<br>punts, motor-launches, full of young fools with next to nothing on,<br>all of them screaming and shouting and most of them with a<br>gramphone aboard as well. The floats of the poor devils who were<br>trying to fish rocked up and down on the wash of the motor-boats.<br><br>I walked a little way. Dirty, choppy water, in spite of the fine<br>day. Nobody was catching anything, not even minnows. I wondered<br>whether they expected to. A crowd like that would be enough to<br>scare every fish in creation. But actually, as I watched the<br>floats rocking up and down among the ice-cream tubs and the paper<br>bags, I doubted whether there were any fish to catch. Are there<br>still fish in the Thames? I suppose there must be. And yet I'll<br>swear the Thames water isn't the same as it used to be. Its colour<br>is quite different. Of course you think that's merely my<br>imagination, but I can tell you it isn't so. I know the water has<br>changed. I remember the Thames water as it used to be, a kind of<br>luminous green that you could see deep into, and the shoals of dace<br>cruising round the reeds. You couldn't see three inches into the<br>water now. It's all brown and dirty, with a film of oil in it from<br>the motor-boats, not to mention the fag-ends and the paper bags.<br><br>After a bit I turned back. Couldn't stand the noise of the<br>gramophones any longer. Of course it's Sunday, I thought.<br>Mightn't be so bad on a week-day. But after all, I knew I'd never<br>come back. God rot them, let 'em keep their bloody river.<br>Wherever I go fishing it won't be in the Thames.<br><br>The crowds swarmed past me. Crowds of bloody aliens, and nearly<br>all of them young. Boys and girls larking along in couples. A<br>troop of girls came past, wearing bell-bottomed trousers and white<br>caps like the ones they wear in the American Navy, with slogans<br>printed on them. One of them, seventeen she might have been, had<br>PLEASE KISS ME. I wouldn't have minded. On an impulse I suddenly<br>turned aside and weighed myself on one of the penny-in-the-slot<br>machines. There was a clicking noise somewhere inside it--you know<br>those machines that tell your fortune as well as your weight--and a<br>typewritten card came sliding out.<br><br>'You are the possessor of exceptional gifts,' I read, 'but owing to<br>excessive modesty you have never received your reward. Those about<br>you underrate your abilities. You are too fond of standing aside<br>and allowing others to take the credit for what you have done<br>yourself . You are sensitive, affectionate, and always loyal to<br>your friends. You are deeply attractive to the opposite sex. Your<br>worst fault is generosity. Persevere, for you will rise high!<br><br>'Weight: 14 stone 11 pounds.'<br><br>I'd put on four pounds in the last three days, I noticed. Must<br>have been the booze.<br><br><br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/18.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/20.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
