<h2>Part 3, Chapter 1</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">When I came home that evening I was still in doubt as to what I'd<br>spend my seventeen quid on.<br><br>Hilda said she was going to the Left Book Club meeting. It seemed<br>that there was a chap coming down from London to lecture, though<br>needless to say Hilda didn't know what the lecture was going to be<br>about. I told her I'd go with her. In a general way I'm not much<br>of a one for lectures, but the visions of war I'd had that morning,<br>starting with the bomber flying over the train, had put me into a<br>kind of thoughtful mood. After the usual argument we got the kids<br>to bed early and cleared off in time for the lecture, which was<br>billed for eight o'clock.<br><br>It was a misty kind of evening, and the hall was cold and not too<br>well lighted. It's a little wooden hall with a tin roof, the<br>property of some Nonconformist sect or other, and you can hire it<br>for ten bob. The usual crowd of fifteen or sixteen people had<br>rolled up. On the front of the platform there was a yellow placard<br>announcing that the lecture was on 'The Menace of Fascism'. This<br>didn't altogether surprise me. Mr Witchett, who acts as chairman<br>of these meetings and who in private life is something in an<br>architect's office, was taking the lecturer round, introducing him<br>to everyone as Mr So-and-so (I forget his name) 'the well-known<br>anti-Fascist', very much as you might call somebody 'the well-known<br>pianist'. The lecturer was a little chap of about forty, in a dark<br>suit, with a bald head which he'd tried rather unsuccessfully to<br>cover up with wisps of hair.<br><br>Meetings of this kind never start on time. There's always a period<br>of hanging about on the pretence that perhaps a few more people are<br>going to turn up. It was about twenty-five past eight when<br>Witchett tapped on the table and did his stuff. Witchett's a mild-<br>looking chap, with a pink, baby's bottom kind of face that's always<br>covered in smiles. I believe he's secretary of the local Liberal<br>Party, and he's also on the Parish Council and acts as M.C. at the<br>magic lantern lectures for the Mothers' Union. He's what you might<br>call a born chairman. When he tells you how delighted we all are<br>to have Mr So-and-so on the platform tonight, you can see that he<br>believes it. I never look at him without thinking that he's<br>probably a virgin. The little lecturer took out a wad of notes,<br>chiefly newspaper cuttings, and pinned them down with his glass of<br>water. Then he gave a quick lick at his lips and began to shoot.<br><br>Do you ever go to lectures, public meetings, and what-not?<br><br>When I go to one myself, there's always a moment during the evening<br>when I find myself thinking the same thought: Why the hell are we<br>doing this? Why is it that people will turn out on a winter night<br>for this kind of thing? I looked round the hall. I was sitting in<br>the back row. I don't ever remember going to any kind of public<br>meeting when I didn't sit in the back row if I could manage it.<br>Hilda and the others had planked themselves in front, as usual.<br>It was rather a gloomy little hall. You know the kind of place.<br>Pitch-pine walls, corrugated iron roof, and enough draughts to make<br>you want to keep your overcoat on. The little knot of us were<br>sitting in the light round the platform, with about thirty rows of<br>empty chairs behind us. And the seats of all the chairs were<br>dusty. On the platform behind the lecturer there was a huge square<br>thing draped in dust-cloths which might have been an enormous<br>coffin under a pall. Actually it was a piano.<br><br>At the beginning I wasn't exactly listening. The lecturer was<br>rather a mean-looking little chap, but a good speaker. White face,<br>very mobile mouth, and the rather grating voice that they get from<br>constant speaking. Of course he was pitching into Hitler and the<br>Nazis. I wasn't particularly keen to hear what he was saying--get<br>the same stuff in the News Chronicle every morning--but his voice<br>came across to me as a kind of burr-burr-burr, with now and again a<br>phrase that struck out and caught my attention.<br><br>'Bestial atrocities. . . . Hideous outbursts of sadism. . . .<br>Rubber truncheons. . . . Concentration camps. . . . Iniquitous<br>persecution of the Jews. . . . Back to the Dark Ages. . . .<br>European civilization. . . . Act before it is too late. . . .<br>Indignation of all decent peoples. . . . Alliance of the<br>democratic nations. . . . Firm stand. . . . Defence of<br>democracy. . . . Democracy. . . . Fascism. . . . Democracy. . . .<br>Fascism. . . . Democracy. . . .'<br><br>You know the line of talk. These chaps can churn it out by the<br>hour. Just like a gramophone. Turn the handle, press the button,<br>and it starts. Democracy, Fascism, Democracy. But somehow it<br>interested me to watch him. A rather mean little man, with a white<br>face and a bald head, standing on a platform, shooting out slogans.<br>What's he doing? Quite deliberately, and quite openly, he's<br>stirring up hatred. Doing his damnedest to make you hate certain<br>foreigners called Fascists. It's a queer thing, I thought, to be<br>known as 'Mr So-and-so, the well-known anti-Fascist'. A queer<br>trade, anti-Fascism. This fellow, I suppose, makes his living by<br>writing books against Hitler. But what did he do before Hitler<br>came along? And what'll he do if Hitler ever disappears? Same<br>question applies to doctors, detectives, rat-catchers, and so<br>forth, of course. But the grating voice went on and on, and<br>another thought struck me. He MEANS it. Not faking at all--feels<br>every word he's saying. He's trying to work up hatred in the<br>audience, but that's nothing to the hatred he feels himself. Every<br>slogan's gospel truth to him. If you cut him open all you'd find<br>inside would be Democracy-Fascism-Democracy. Interesting to know a<br>chap like that in private life. But does he have a private life?<br>Or does he only go round from platform to platform, working up<br>hatred? Perhaps even his dreams are slogans.<br><br>As well as I could from the back row I had a look at the audience.<br>I suppose, if you come to think of it, we people who'll turn out on<br>winter nights to sit in draughty halls listening to Left Book Club<br>lectures (and I consider that I'm entitled to the 'we', seeing that<br>I'd done it myself on this occasion) have a certain significance.<br>We're the West Bletchley revolutionaries. Doesn't look hopeful at<br>first sight. It struck me as I looked round the audience that only<br>about half a dozen of them had really grasped what the lecturer was<br>talking about, though by this time he'd been pitching into Hitler<br>and the Nazis for over half an hour. It's always like that with<br>meetings of this kind. Invariably half the people come away<br>without a notion of what it's all about. In his chair beside the<br>table Witchett was watching the lecturer with a delighted smile,<br>and his face looked a little like a pink geranium. You could hear<br>in advance the speech he'd make as soon as the lecturer sat down--<br>same speech as he makes at the end of the magic lantern lecture in<br>aid of trousers for the Melanesians: 'Express our thanks--voicing<br>the opinion of all of us--most interesting--give us all a lot to<br>think about--most stimulating evening!' In the front row Miss<br>Minns was sitting very upright, with her head cocked a little on<br>one side, like a bird. The lecturer had taken a sheet of paper<br>from under the tumbler and was reading out statistics about the<br>German suicide-rate. You could see by the look of Miss Minns's<br>long thin neck that she wasn't feeling happy. Was this improving<br>her mind, or wasn't it? If only she could make out what it was all<br>about! The other two were sitting there like lumps of pudding.<br>Next to them a little woman with red hair was knitting a jumper.<br>One plain, two purl, drop one, and knit two together. The lecturer<br>was describing how the Nazis chop people's heads off for treason<br>and sometimes the executioner makes a bosh shot. There was one<br>other woman in the audience, a girl with dark hair, one of the<br>teachers at the Council School. Unlike the other she was really<br>listening, sitting forward with her big round eyes fixed on the<br>lecturer and her mouth a little bit open, drinking it all in.<br><br>Just behind her two old blokes from the local Labour Party were<br>sitting. One had grey hair cropped very short, the other had a<br>bald head and a droopy moustache. Both wearing their overcoats.<br>You know the type. Been in the Labour Party since the year dot.<br>Lives given up to the movement. Twenty years of being blacklisted<br>by employers, and another ten of badgering the Council to do<br>something about the slums. Suddenly everything's changed, the old<br>Labour Party stuff doesn't matter any longer. Find themselves<br>pitchforked into foreign politics--Hitler, Stalin, bombs, machine-<br>guns, rubber truncheons, Rome-Berlin axis, Popular Front, anti-<br>Comintern pact. Can't make head or tail of it. Immediately in<br>front of me the local Communist Party branch were sitting. All<br>three of them very young. One of them's got money and is something<br>in the Hesperides Estate Company, in fact I believe he's old Crum's<br>nephew. Another's a clerk at one of the banks. He cashes cheques<br>for me occasionally. A nice boy, with a round, very young, eager<br>face, blue eyes like a baby, and hair so fair that you'd think he<br>peroxided it. He only looks about seventeen, though I suppose he's<br>twenty. He was wearing a cheap blue suit and a bright blue tie<br>that went with his hair. Next to these three another Communist was<br>sitting. But this one, it seems, is a different kind of Communist<br>and not-quite, because he's what they call a Trotskyist. The<br>others have got a down on him. He's even younger, a very thin,<br>very dark, nervous-looking boy. Clever face. Jew, of course.<br>These four were taking the lecture quite differently from the<br>others. You knew they'd be on their feet the moment question-time<br>started. You could see them kind of twitching already. And the<br>little Trotskyist working himself from side to side on his bum in<br>his anxiety to get in ahead of the others.<br><br>I'd stopped listening to the actual words of the lecture. But<br>there are more ways than one of listening. I shut my eyes for a<br>moment. The effect of that was curious. I seemed to see the<br>fellow much better when I could only hear his voice.<br><br>It was a voice that sounded as if it could go on for a fortnight<br>without stopping. It's a ghastly thing, really, to have a sort of<br>human barrel-organ shooting propaganda at you by the hour. The<br>same thing over and over again. Hate, hate, hate. Let's all get<br>together and have a good hate. Over and over. It gives you the<br>feeling that something has got inside your skull and is hammering<br>down on your brain. But for a moment, with my eyes shut, I managed<br>to turn the tables on him. I got inside HIS skull. It was a<br>peculiar sensation. For about a second I was inside him, you might<br>almost say I WAS him. At any rate, I felt what he was feeling.<br><br>I saw the vision that he was seeing. And it wasn't at all the kind<br>of vision that can be talked about. What he's SAYING is merely<br>that Hitler's after us and we must all get together and have a good<br>hate. Doesn't go into details. Leaves it all respectable. But<br>what he's SEEING is something quite different. It's a picture of<br>himself smashing people's faces in with a spanner. Fascist faces,<br>of course. I KNOW that's what he was seeing. It was what I saw<br>myself for the second or two that I was inside him. Smash! Right<br>in the middle! The bones cave in like an eggshell and what was a<br>face a minute ago is just a great big blob of strawberry jam.<br>Smash! There goes another! That's what's in his mind, waking and<br>sleeping, and the more he thinks of it the more he likes it. And<br>it's all O.K. because the smashed faces belong to Fascists. You<br>could hear all that in the tone of his voice.<br><br>But why? Likeliest explanation, because he's scared. Every<br>thinking person nowadays is stiff with fright. This is merely a<br>chap who's got sufficient foresight to be a little more frightened<br>than the others. Hitler's after us! Quick! Let's all grab a<br>spanner and get together, and perhaps if we smash in enough faces<br>they won't smash ours. Gang up, choose your Leader. Hitler's<br>black and Stalin's white. But it might just as well be the other<br>way about, because in the little chap's mind both Hitler and Stalin<br>are the same. Both mean spanners and smashed faces.<br><br>War! I started thinking about it again. It's coming soon, that's<br>certain. But who's afraid of war? That's to say, who's afraid of<br>the bombs and the machine-guns? 'You are', you say. Yes, I am,<br>and so's anybody who's ever seen them. But it isn't the war that<br>matters, it's the after-war. The world we're going down into, the<br>kind of hate-world, slogan-world. The coloured shirts, the barbed<br>wire, the rubber truncheons. The secret cells where the electric<br>light burns night and day, and the detectives watching you while<br>you sleep. And the processions and the posters with enormous<br>faces, and the crowds of a million people all cheering for the<br>Leader till they deafen themselves into thinking that they really<br>worship him, and all the time, underneath, they hate him so that<br>they want to puke. It's all going to happen. Or isn't it? Some<br>days I know it's impossible, other days I know it's inevitable.<br>That night, at any rate, I knew it was going to happen. It was all<br>in the sound of the little lecturer's voice.<br><br>So perhaps after all there IS a significance in this mingy little<br>crowd that'll turn out on a winter night to listen to a lecture of<br>this kind. Or at any rate in the five or six who can grasp what<br>it's all about. They're simply the outposts of an enormous army.<br>They're the long-sighted ones, the first rats to spot that the ship<br>is sinking. Quick, quick! The Fascists are coming! Spanners<br>ready, boys! Smash others or they'll smash you. So terrified of<br>the future that we're jumping straight into it like a rabbit diving<br>down a boa-constrictor's throat.<br><br>And what'll happen to chaps like me when we get Fascism in England?<br>The truth is it probably won't make the slightest difference. As<br>for the lecturer and those four Communists in the audience, yes,<br>it'll make plenty of difference to them. They'll be smashing<br>faces, or having their own smashed, according to who's winning.<br>But the ordinary middling chaps like me will be carrying on just as<br>usual. And yet it frightens me--I tell you it frightens me. I'd<br>just started to wonder why when the lecturer stopped and sat down.<br><br>There was the usual hollow little sound of clapping that you get<br>when there are only about fifteen people in the audience, and then<br>old Witchett said his piece, and before you could say Jack Robinson<br>the four Communists were on their feet together. They had a good<br>dog-fight that went on for about ten minutes, full of a lot of<br>stuff that nobody else understood, such as dialectical materialism<br>and the destiny of the proletariat and what Lenin said in 1918.<br>Then the lecturer, who'd had a drink of water, stood up and gave a<br>summing-up that made the Trotskyist wriggle about on his chair but<br>pleased the other three, and the dog-fight went on unofficially for<br>a bit longer. Nobody else did any talking. Hilda and the others<br>had cleared off the moment the lecture ended. Probably they were<br>afraid there was going to be a collection to pay for the hire of<br>the hall. The little woman with red hair was staying to finish her<br>row. You could hear her counting her stitches in a whisper while<br>the others argued. And Witchett sat and beamed at whoever happened<br>to be speaking, and you could see him thinking how interesting it<br>all was and making mental notes, and the girl with black hair<br>looked from one to the other with her mouth a little open, and the<br>old Labour man, looking rather like a seal with his droopy<br>moustache and his overcoat up to his ears, sat looking up at them,<br>wondering what the hell it was all about. And finally I got up and<br>began to put on my overcoat.<br><br>The dog-fight had turned into a private row between the little<br>Trotskyist and the boy with fair hair. They were arguing about<br>whether you ought to join the Army if war broke out. As I edged<br>my way along the row of chairs to get out, the fair-haired one<br>appealed to me.<br><br>'Mr Bowling! Look here. If war broke out and we had the chance to<br>smash Fascism once and for all, wouldn't you fight? If you were<br>young, I mean.'<br><br>I suppose he thinks I'm about sixty.<br><br>'You bet I wouldn't,' I said. 'I had enough to go on with last<br>time.'<br><br>'But to smash Fascism!'<br><br>'Oh, b-- Fascism! There's been enough smashing done already, if<br>you ask me.'<br><br>The little Trotskyist chips in with social-patriotism and betrayal<br>of the workers, but the others cut him short:<br><br>'But you're thinking of 1914. That was just an ordinary imperialist<br>war. This time it's different. Look here. When you hear about<br>what's going on in Germany, and the concentration camps and the<br>Nazis beating people up with rubber truncheons and making the Jews<br>spit in each other's faces--doesn't it make your blood boil?'<br><br>They're always going on about your blood boiling. Just the same<br>phrase during the war, I remember.<br><br>'I went off the boil in 1916,' I told him. 'And so'll you when you<br>know what a trench smells like.'<br><br>And then all of a sudden I seemed to see him. It was as if I<br>hadn't properly seen him till that moment.<br><br>A very young eager face, might have belonged to a good-looking<br>schoolboy, with blue eyes and tow-coloured hair, gazing into mine,<br>and for a moment actually he'd got tears in his eyes! Felt as<br>strongly as all that about the German Jews! But as a matter of<br>fact I knew just what he felt. He's a hefty lad, probably plays<br>rugger for the bank. Got brains, too. And here he is, a bank<br>clerk in a godless suburb, sitting behind the frosted window,<br>entering figures in a ledger, counting piles of notes, bumsucking<br>to the manager. Feels his life rotting away. And all the while,<br>over in Europe, the big stuff's happening. Shells bursting over<br>the trenches and waves of infantry charging through the drifts of<br>smoke. Probably some of his pals are fighting in Spain. Of course<br>he's spoiling for a war. How can you blame him? For a moment I<br>had a peculiar feeling that he was my son, which in point of years<br>he might have been. And I thought of that sweltering hot day in<br>August when the newsboy stuck up the poster ENGLAND DECLARES WAR ON<br>GERMANY, and we all rushed out on to the pavement in our white<br>aprons and cheered.<br><br>'Listen son,' I said, 'you've got it all wrong. In 1914 WE thought<br>it was going to be a glorious business. Well, it wasn't. It was<br>just a bloody mess. If it comes again, you keep out of it. Why<br>should you get your body plugged full of lead? Keep it for some<br>girl. You think war's all heroism and V.C. charges, but I tell you<br>it isn't like that. You don't have bayonet-charges nowadays, and<br>when you do it isn't like you imagine. You don't feel like a hero.<br>All you know is that you've had no sleep for three days, and stink<br>like a polecat, you're pissing your bags with fright, and your<br>hands are so cold you can't hold your rifle. But that doesn't<br>matter a damn, either. It's the things that happen afterwards.'<br><br>Makes no impression of course. They just think you're out of date.<br>Might as well stand at the door of a knocking-shop handing out<br>tracts.<br><br>The people were beginning to clear off. Witchett was taking the<br>lecturer home. The three Communists and the little Jew went up the<br>road together, and they were going at it again with proletarian<br>solidarity and dialectic of the dialectic and what Trotsky said in<br>1917. They're all the same, really. It was a damp, still, very<br>black night. The lamps seemed to hang in the darkness like stars<br>and didn't light the road. In the distance you could hear the<br>trains booming along the High Street. I wanted a drink, but it was<br>nearly ten and the nearest pub was half a mile away. Besides, I<br>wanted somebody to talk to, the way you can't talk in a pub. It<br>was funny how my brain had been on the go all day. Partly the<br>result of not working, of course, and partly of the new false<br>teeth, which had kind of freshened me up. All day I'd been<br>brooding on the future and the past. I wanted to talk about the<br>bad time that's either coming or isn't coming, the slogans and the<br>coloured shirts and the streamlined men from eastern Europe who are<br>going to knock old England cock-eyed. Hopeless trying to talk to<br>Hilda. Suddenly it occurred to me to go and look up old Porteous,<br>who's a pal of mine and keeps late hours.<br><br>Porteous is a retired public-school master. He lives in rooms,<br>which luckily are in the lower half of the house, in the old part<br>of the town, near the church. He's a bachelor, of course. You<br>can't imagine that kind married. Lives all alone with his books<br>and his pipe and has a woman in to do for him. He's a learned kind<br>of chap, with his Greek and Latin and poetry and all that. I<br>suppose that if the local Left Book Club branch represents<br>Progress, old Porteous stands for Culture. Neither of them cuts<br>much ice in West Bletchley.<br><br>The light was burning in the little room where old Porteous sits<br>reading till all hours of the night. As I tapped on the front door<br>he came strolling out as usual, with his pipe between his teeth and<br>his fingers in a book to keep the place. He's rather a striking<br>looking chap, very tall, with curly grey hair and a thin, dreamy<br>kind of face that's a bit discoloured but might almost belong to a<br>boy, though he must be nearly sixty. It's funny how some of these<br>public-school and university chaps manage to look like boys till<br>their dying day. It's something in their movements. Old Porteous<br>has got a way of strolling up and down, with that handsome head of<br>his, with the grey curls, held a little back that makes you feel<br>that all the while he's dreaming about some poem or other and isn't<br>conscious of what's going on round him. You can't look at him<br>without seeing the way he's lived written all over him. Public<br>School, Oxford, and then back to his old school as a master. Whole<br>life lived in an atmosphere of Latin, Greek, and cricket. He's got<br>all the mannerisms. Always wears an old Harris tweed jacket and<br>old grey flannel bags which he likes you to call 'disgraceful',<br>smokes a pipe and looks down on cigarettes, and though he sits up<br>half the night I bet he has a cold bath every morning. I suppose<br>from his point of view I'm a bit of a bounder. I haven't been to a<br>public school, I don't know any Latin and don't even want to. He<br>tells me sometimes that it's a pity I'm 'insensible to beauty',<br>which I suppose is a polite way of saying that I've got no<br>education. All the same I like him. He's very hospitable in the<br>right kind of way, always ready to have you in and talk at all<br>hours, and always got drinks handy. When you live in a house like<br>ours, more or less infested by women and kids, it does you good to<br>get out of it sometimes into a bachelor atmosphere, a kind of book-<br>pipe-fire atmosphere. And the classy Oxford feeling of nothing<br>mattering except books and poetry and Greek statues, and nothing<br>worth mentioning having happened since the Goths sacked Rome--<br>sometimes that's a comfort too.<br><br>He shoved me into the old leather armchair by the fire and dished<br>out whisky and soda. I've never seen his sitting-room when it<br>wasn't dim with pipe-smoke. The ceiling is almost black. It's a<br>smallish room and, except for the door and the window and the space<br>over the fireplace, the walls are covered with books from the floor<br>right up to the ceiling. On the mantelpiece there are all the<br>things you'd expect. A row of old briar pipes, all filthy, a few<br>Greek silver coins, a tobacco jar with the arms of old Porteous's<br>college on it, and a little earthenware lamp which he told me he<br>dug up on some mountain in Sicily. Over the mantelpiece there are<br>photos of Greek statues. There's a big one in the middle, of a<br>woman with wings and no head who looks as if she was stepping out<br>to catch a bus. I remember how shocked old Porteous was when the<br>first time I saw it, not knowing any better, I asked him why they<br>didn't stick a head on it.<br><br>Porteous started refilling his pipe from the jar on the<br>mantelpiece.<br><br>'That intolerable woman upstairs has purchased a wireless set,' he<br>said. 'I had been hoping to live the rest of my life out of the<br>sound of those things. I suppose there is nothing one can do? Do<br>you happen to know the legal position?'<br><br>I told him there was nothing one could do. I rather like the<br>Oxfordy way he says 'intolerable', and it tickles me, in 1938, to<br>find someone objecting to having a radio in the house. Porteous<br>was strolling up and down in his usual dreamy way, with his hands<br>in his coat pockets and his pipe between his teeth, and almost<br>instantly he'd begun talking about some law against musical<br>instruments that was passed in Athens in the time of Pericles.<br>It's always that way with old Porteous. All his talk is about<br>things that happened centuries ago. Whatever you start off with it<br>always comes back to statues and poetry and the Greeks and Romans.<br>If you mention the Queen Mary he'd start telling you about<br>Phoenician triremes. He never reads a modern book, refuses to know<br>their names, never looks at any newspaper except The Times, and<br>takes a pride in telling you that he's never been to the pictures.<br>Except for a few poets like Keats and Wordsworth he thinks the<br>modern world--and from his point of view the modern world is the<br>last two thousand years--just oughtn't to have happened.<br><br>I'm part of the modern world myself, but I like to hear him talk.<br>He'll stroll round the shelves and haul out first one book and then<br>another, and now and again he'll read you a piece between little<br>puffs of smoke, generally having to translate it from the Latin or<br>something as he goes. It's all kind of peaceful, kind of mellow.<br>All a little like a school-master, and yet it soothes you, somehow.<br>While you listen you aren't in the same world as trains and gas<br>bills and insurance companies. It's all temples and olive trees,<br>and peacocks and elephants, and chaps in the arena with their nets<br>and tridents, and winged lions and eunuchs and galleys and<br>catapults, and generals in brass armour galloping their horses over<br>the soldiers' shields. It's funny that he ever cottoned on to a<br>chap like me. But it's one of the advantages of being fat that you<br>can fit into almost any society. Besides we meet on common ground<br>when it comes to dirty stories. They're the one modern thing he<br>cares about, though, as he's always reminding me, they aren't<br>modern. He's rather old-maidish about it, always tells a story in<br>a veiled kind of way. Sometimes he'll pick out some Latin poet and<br>translate a smutty rhyme, leaving a lot to your imagination, or<br>he'll drop hints about the private lives of the Roman emperors and<br>the things that went on in the temples of Ashtaroth. They seem to<br>have been a bad lot, those Greeks and Romans. Old Porteous has got<br>photographs of wall-paintings somewhere in Italy that would make<br>your hair curl.<br><br>When I'm fed up with business and home life it's often done me a<br>lot of good to go and have a talk with Porteous. But tonight it<br>didn't seem to. My mind was still running on the same lines as it<br>had been all day. Just as I'd done with the Left Book Club<br>lecturer, I didn't exactly listen to what Porreous was saying, only<br>to the sound of his voice. But whereas the lecturer's voice had<br>got under my skin, old Porteous's didn't. It was too peaceful, too<br>Oxfordy. Finally, when he was in the middle of saying something, I<br>chipped in and said:<br><br>'Tell me, Porteous, what do you think of Hitler?'<br><br>Old Porteous was leaning in his lanky, graceful kind of way with<br>his elbows on the mantelpiece and a foot on the fender. He was so<br>surprised that he almost took his pipe out of his mouth.<br><br>'Hitler? This German person? My dear fellow! I DON'T think of<br>him.'<br><br>'But the trouble is he's going to bloody well make us think about<br>him before he's finished.'<br><br>Old Porteous shies a bit at the world 'bloody', which he doesn't<br>like, though of course it's part of his pose never to be shocked.<br>He begins walking up and down again, puffing out smoke.<br><br>'I see no reason for paying any attention to him. A mere<br>adventurer. These people come and go. Ephemeral, purely<br>ephemeral.'<br><br>I'm not certain what the word 'ephemeral' means, but I stick to my<br>point:<br><br>'I think you've got it wrong. Old Hitler's something different.<br>So's Joe Stalin. They aren't like these chaps in the old days who<br>crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth, just for<br>the fun of it. They're after something quite new--something that's<br>never been heard of before.'<br><br>'My dear fellow! There is nothing new under the sun.'<br><br>Of course that's a favourite saying of old Porteous's. He won't<br>hear of the existence of anything new. As soon as you tell him<br>about anything that's happening nowadays he says that exactly the<br>same thing happened in the reign of King So-and-so. Even if you<br>bring up things like aeroplanes he tells you that they probably had<br>them in Crete, or Mycenae, or wherever it was. I tried to explain<br>to him what I'd felt while the little bloke was lecturing and the<br>kind of vision I'd had of the bad time that's coming, but he<br>wouldn't listen. Merely repeated that there's nothing new under<br>the sun. Finally he hauls a book out of the shelves and reads me a<br>passage about some Greek tyrant back in the B.C.s who certainly<br>might have been Hitler's twin brother.<br><br>The argument went on for a bit. All day I'd been wanting to talk<br>to somebody about this business. It's funny. I'm not a fool, but<br>I'm not a highbrow either, and God knows at normal times I don't<br>have many interests that you wouldn't expect a middle-aged seven-<br>pound-a-weeker with two kids to have. And yet I've enough sense to<br>see that the old life we're used to is being sawn off at the roots.<br>I can feel it happening. I can see the war that's coming and I can<br>see the after-war, the food-queues and the secret police and the<br>loudspeakers telling you what to think. And I'm not even<br>exceptional in this. There are millions of others like me.<br>Ordinary chaps that I meet everywhere, chaps I run across in pubs,<br>bus drivers, and travelling salesmen for hardware firms, have got a<br>feeling that the world's gone wrong. They can feel things cracking<br>and collapsing under their feet. And yet here's this learned chap,<br>who's lived all his life with books and soaked himself in history<br>till it's running out of his pores, and he can't even see that<br>things are changing. Doesn't think Hitler matters. Refuses to<br>believe there's another war coming. In any case, as he didn't<br>fight in the last war, it doesn't enter much into his thoughts--he<br>thinks it was a poor show compared with the siege of Troy. Doesn't<br>see why one should bother about the slogans and the loudspeakers<br>and the coloured shirts. What intelligent person would pay any<br>attention to such things? he always says. Hitler and Stalin will<br>pass away, but something which old Porteous calls 'the eternal<br>verities' won't pass away. This, of course, is simply another way<br>of saying that things will always go on exactly as he's known them.<br>For ever and ever, cultivated Oxford blokes will stroll up and down<br>studies full of books, quoting Latin tags and smoking good tobacco<br>out of jars with coats of arms on them. Really it was no use<br>talking to him. I'd have got more change out of the lad with tow-<br>coloured hair. By degrees the conversation twisted off, as it<br>always does, to things that happened B.C. Then it worked round to<br>poetry. Finally old Porteous drags another book out of the shelves<br>and begins reading Keat's 'Ode to a Nightingale' (or maybe it was a<br>skylark--I forget).<br><br>So far as I'm concerned a little poetry goes a long way. But it's<br>a curious fact that I rather like hearing old Porteous reading it<br>aloud. There's no question that he reads well. He's got the<br>habit, of course--used to reading to classes of boys. He'll lean<br>up against something in his lounging way, with his pipe between his<br>teeth and little jets of smoke coming out, and his voice goes kind<br>of solemn and rises and falls with the line. You can see that it<br>moves him in some way. I don't know what poetry is or what it's<br>supposed to do. I imagine it has a kind of nervous effect on some<br>people like music has on others. When he's reading I don't<br>actually listen, that's to say I don't take in the words, but<br>sometimes the sound of it brings a kind of peaceful feeling into my<br>mind. On the whole I like it. But somehow tonight it didn't work.<br>It was as if a cold draught had blown into the room. I just felt<br>that this was all bunk. Poetry! What is it? Just a voice, a bit<br>of an eddy in the air. And Gosh! what use would that be against<br>machine-guns?<br><br>I watched him leaning up against the bookshelf. Funny, these<br>public-school chaps. Schoolboys all their days. Whole life<br>revolving round the old school and their bits of Latin and Greek<br>and poetry. And suddenly I remembered that almost the first time I<br>was here with Porteous he'd read me the very same poem. Read it in<br>just the same way, and his voice quivered when he got to the same<br>bit--the bit about magic casements, or something. And a curious<br>thought struck me. HE'S DEAD. He's a ghost. All people like that<br>are dead.<br><br>It struck me that perhaps a lot of the people you see walking about<br>are dead. We say that a man's dead when his heart stops and not<br>before. It seems a bit arbitrary. After all, parts of your body<br>don't stop working--hair goes on growing for years, for instance.<br>Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the<br>power to take in a new idea. Old Porteous is like that.<br>Wonderfully learned, wonderfully good taste--but he's not capable<br>of change. Just says the same things and thinks the same thoughts<br>over and over again. There are a lot of people like that. Dead<br>minds, stopped inside. Just keep moving backwards and forwards on<br>the same little track, getting fainter all the time, like ghosts.<br><br>Old Porteous's mind, I thought, probably stopped working at about<br>the time of the Russo-Japanese War. And it's a ghastly thing that<br>nearly all the decent people, the people who DON'T want to go round<br>smashing faces in with spanners, are like that. They're decent,<br>but their minds have stopped. They can't defend themselves against<br>what's coming to them, because they can't see it, even when it's<br>under their noses. They think that England will never change and<br>that England's the whole world. Can't grasp that it's just a left-<br>over, a tiny corner that the bombs happen to have missed. But what<br>about the new kind of men from eastern Europe, the streamlined men<br>who think in slogans and talk in bullets? They're on our track.<br>Not long before they catch up with us. No Marquess of Queensbury<br>rules for those boys. And all the decent people are paralysed.<br>Dead men and live gorillas. Doesn't seem to be anything between.<br><br>I cleared out about half an hour later, having completely failed to<br>convince old Porteous that Hitler matters. I was still thinking<br>the same thoughts as I walked home through the shivery streets.<br>The trains had stopped running. The house was all dark and Hilda<br>was asleep. I dropped my false teeth into the glass of water in<br>the bathroom, got into my pyjamas, and prised Hilda over to the<br>other side of the bed. She rolled over without waking, and the<br>kind of hump between her shoulders was towards me. It's funny, the<br>tremendous gloom that sometimes gets hold of you late at night. At<br>that moment the destiny of Europe seemed to me more important than<br>the rent and the kids' school-bills and the work I'd have to do<br>tomorrow. For anyone who has to earn his living such thoughts are<br>just plain foolishness. But they didn't move out of my mind.<br>Still the vision of the coloured shirts and the machine-guns<br>rattling. The last thing I remember wondering before I fell asleep<br>was why the hell a chap like me should care. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/13.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/15.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
