<h2>Part 1, Chapter 3</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">There was a bombing plane flying low overhead. For a minute or two<br>it seemed to be keeping pace with the train. Two vulgar kind of<br>blokes in shabby overcoats, obviously commercials of the lowest<br>type, newspaper canvassers probably, were sitting opposite me. One<br>of them was reading the Mail and the other was reading the Express.<br>I could see by their manner that they'd spotted me for one of their<br>kind. Up at the other end of the carriage two lawyers' clerks with<br>black bags were keeping up a conversation full of legal baloney<br>that was meant to impress the rest of us and show that they didn't<br>belong to the common herd.<br><br>I was watching the backs of the houses sliding past. The line from<br>West Bletchley runs most of the way through slums, but it's kind of<br>peaceful, the glimpses you get of little backyards with bits of<br>flowers stuck in boxes and the flat roofs where the women peg out<br>the washing and the bird-cage on the wall. The great black bombing<br>plane swayed a little in the air and zoomed ahead so that I<br>couldn't see it. I was sitting with my back to the engine. One of<br>the commercials cocked his eye at it for just a second. I knew<br>what he was thinking. For that matter it's what everybody else is<br>thinking. You don't have to be a highbrow to think such thoughts<br>nowadays. In two years' time, one year's time, what shall we be<br>doing when we see one of those things? Making a dive for the<br>cellar, wetting our bags with fright.<br><br>The commercial bloke put down his Daily Mail.<br><br>'Templegate's winner come in,' he said.<br><br>The lawyers' clerks were sprouting some learned rot about fee-<br>simple and peppercorns. The other commercial felt in his waistcoat<br>pocket and took out a bent Woodbine. He felt in the other pocket<br>and then leaned across to me.<br><br>'Got a match, Tubby?'<br><br>I felt for my matches. 'Tubby', you notice. That's interesting,<br>really. For about a couple of minutes I stopped thinking about<br>bombs and began thinking about my figure as I'd studied it in my<br>bath that morning.<br><br>It's quite true I'm tubby, in fact my upper half is almost exactly<br>the shape of a tub. But what's interesting, I think, is that<br>merely because you happen to be a little bit fat, almost anyone,<br>even a total, stranger, will take it for granted to give you a<br>nickname that's an insulting comment on your personal appearance.<br>Suppose a chap was a hunchback or had a squint or a hare-lip--would<br>you give him a nickname to remind him of it? But every fat man's<br>labelled as a matter of course. I'm the type that people<br>automatically slap on the back and punch in the ribs, and nearly<br>all of them think I like it. I never go into the saloon bar of the<br>Crown at Pudley (I pass that way once a week on business) without<br>that ass Waters, who travels for the Seafoam Soap people but who's<br>more or less a permanency in the saloon bar of the Crown, prodding<br>me in the ribs and singing out 'Here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom<br>Bowling!' which is a joke the bloody fools in the bar never get<br>tired of. Waters has got a finger like a bar of iron. They all<br>think a fat man doesn't have any feelings.<br><br>The commercial took another of my matches, to pick his teeth with,<br>and chucked the box back. The train whizzed on to an iron bridge.<br>Down below I got a glimpse of a baker's van and a long string of<br>lorries loaded with cement. The queer thing, I was thinking, is<br>that in a way they're right about fat men. It's a fact that a fat<br>man, particularly a man who's been fat from birth--from childhood,<br>that's to say--isn't quite like other men. He goes through his<br>life on a different plane, a sort of light-comedy plane, though in<br>the case of blokes in side-shows at fairs, or in fact anyone over<br>twenty stone, it isn't so much light comedy as low farce. I've<br>been both fat and thin in my life, and I know the difference<br>fatness makes to your outlook. It kind of prevents you from taking<br>things too hard. I doubt whether a man who's never been anything<br>but fat, a man who's been called Fatty ever since he could walk,<br>even knows of the existence of any really deep emotions. How could<br>he? He's got no experience of such things. He can't ever be<br>present at a tragic scene, because a scene where there's a fat man<br>present isn't tragic, it's comic. Just imagine a fat Hamlet, for<br>instance! Or Oliver Hardy acting Romeo. Funnily enough I'd been<br>thinking something of the kind only a few days earlier when I was<br>reading a novel I'd got out of Boots. Wasted Passion, it was<br>called. The chap in the story finds out that his girl has gone off<br>with another chap. He's one of these chaps you read about in<br>novels, that have pale sensitive faces and dark hair and a private<br>income. I remember more or less how the passage went:<br><br><br>David paced up and down the room, his hands pressed to his<br>forehead. The news seemed to have stunned him. For a long time<br>he could not believe it. Sheila untrue to him! It could not be!<br>Suddenly realization rushed over him, and he saw the fact in all<br>its stark horror. It was too much. He flung himself down in a<br>paroxysm of weeping.<br><br><br>Anyway, it went something like that. And even at the time it<br>started me thinking. There you have it, you see. That's how<br>people--some people--are expected to behave. But how about a chap<br>like me? Suppose Hilda went off for a week-end with somebody else-<br>-not that I'd care a damn, in fact it would rather please me to<br>find that she'd still got that much kick left in her--but suppose I<br>did care, would I fling myself down in a paroxysm of weeping?<br>Would anyone expect me to? You couldn't, with a figure like mine.<br>It would be downright obscene.<br><br>The train was running along an embankment. A little below us you<br>could see the roofs of the houses stretching on and on, the little<br>red roofs where the bombs are going to drop, a bit lighted up at<br>this moment because a ray of sunshine was catching them. Funny how<br>we keep on thinking about bombs. Of course there's no question<br>that it's coming soon. You can tell how close it is by the cheer-<br>up stuff they're talking about it in the newspaper. I was reading<br>a piece in the News Chronicle the other day where it said that<br>bombing planes can't do any damage nowadays. The anti-aircraft<br>guns have got so good that the bomber has to stay at twenty<br>thousand feet. The chap thinks, you notice, that if an aeroplane's<br>high enough the bombs don't reach the ground. Or more likely what<br>he really meant was that they'll miss Woolwich Arsenal and only hit<br>places like Ellesmere Road.<br><br>But taking it by and large, I thought, it's not so bad to be fat.<br>One thing about a fat man is that he's always popular. There's<br>really no kind of company, from bookies to bishops, where a fat man<br>doesn't fit in and feel at home. As for women, fat men have more<br>luck with them than people seem to think. It's all bunk to<br>imagine, as some people do, that a woman looks on a fat man as just<br>a joke. The truth is that a woman doesn't look on ANY man as a<br>joke if he can kid her that he's in love with her.<br><br>Mind you, I haven't always been fat. I've been fat for eight or<br>nine years, and I suppose I've developed most of the characteristics.<br>But it's also a fact that internally, mentally, I'm not altogether<br>fat. No! Don't mistake me. I'm not trying to put myself over as a<br>kind of tender flower, the aching heart behind the smiling face and<br>so forth. You couldn't get on in the insurance business if you were<br>anything like that. I'm vulgar, I'm insensitive, and I fit in with<br>my environment. So long as anywhere in the world things are being<br>sold on commission and livings are picked up by sheer brass and lack<br>of finer feelings, chaps like me will be doing it. In almost all<br>circumstances I'd manage to make a living--always a living and never<br>a fortune--and even in war, revolution, plague, and famine I'd back<br>myself to stay alive longer than most people. I'm that type. But<br>also I've got something else inside me, chiefly a hangover from the<br>past. I'll tell you about that later. I'm fat, but I'm thin<br>inside. Has it ever struck you that there's a thin man inside every<br>fat man, just as they say there's a statue inside every block of<br>stone?<br><br>The chap who'd borrowed my matches was having a good pick at his<br>teeth over the Express.<br><br>'Legs case don't seem to get much forrader,' he said.<br><br>'They'll never get 'im,' said the other. ''Ow could you identify a<br>pair of legs? They're all the bleeding same, aren't they?'<br><br>'Might trace 'im through the piece of paper 'e wrapped 'em up in,'<br>said the first.<br><br>Down below you could see the roofs of the houses stretching on and<br>on, twisting this way and that with the streets, but stretching on<br>and on, like an enormous plain that you could have ridden over.<br>Whichever way you cross London it's twenty miles of houses almost<br>without a break. Christ! how can the bombers miss us when they<br>come? We're just one great big bull's-eye. And no warning,<br>probably. Because who's going to be such a bloody fool as to<br>declare war nowadays? If I was Hitler I'd send my bombers across<br>in the middle of a disarmament conference. Some quiet morning,<br>when the clerks are streaming across London Bridge, and the<br>canary's singing, and the old woman's pegging the bloomers on the<br>line--zoom, whizz, plonk! Houses going up into the air, bloomers<br>soaked with blood, canary singing on above the corpses.<br><br>Seems a pity somehow, I thought. I looked at the great sea of<br>roofs stretching on and on. Miles and miles of streets, fried-fish<br>shops, tin chapels, picture houses, little printing-shops up back<br>alleys, factories, blocks of flats, whelk stalls, dairies, power<br>stations--on and on and on. Enormous! And the peacefulness of it!<br>Like a great wilderness with no wild beasts. No guns firing,<br>nobody chucking pineapples, nobody beating anybody else up with a<br>rubber truncheon. If you come to think of it, in the whole of<br>England at this moment there probably isn't a single bedroom window<br>from which anyone's firing a machine-gun.<br><br>But how about five years from now? Or two years? Or one year? <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/1.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/3.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
