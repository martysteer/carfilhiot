<h2>Part 2, Chapter 6</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">And besides fishing there was reading.<br><br>I've exaggerated if I've given the impression that fishing was the<br>ONLY thing I cared about. Fishing certainly came first, but<br>reading was a good second. I must have been either ten or eleven<br>when I started reading--reading voluntarily, I mean. At that age<br>it's like discovering a new world. I'm a considerable reader even<br>now, in fact there aren't many weeks in which I don't get through a<br>couple of novels. I'm what you might call the typical Boots<br>Library subscriber, I always fall for the best-seller of the moment<br>(The Good Companions, Bengal Lancer, Hatter's Castle--I fell for<br>every one of them), and I've been a member of the Left Book Club<br>for a year or more. And in 1918, when I was twenty-five, I had a<br>sort of debauch of reading that made a certain difference to my<br>outlook. But nothing is ever like those first years when you<br>suddenly discover that you can open a penny weekly paper and plunge<br>straight into thieves' kitchens and Chinese opium dens and<br>Polynesian islands and the forests of Brazil.<br><br>It was from when I was eleven to when I was about sixteen that I<br>got my biggest kick out of reading. At first it was always the<br>boys' penny weeklies--little thin papers with vile print and an<br>illustration in three colours on the cover--and a bit later it was<br>books. Sherlock Holmes, Dr Nikola, The Iron Pirate, Dracula,<br>Raffles. And Nat Gould and Ranger Gull and a chap whose name I<br>forget who wrote boxing stories almost as rapidly as Nat Gould<br>wrote racing ones. I suppose if my parents had been a little<br>better educated I'd have had 'good' books shoved down my throat,<br>Dickens and Thackeray and so forth, and in fact they did drive us<br>through Quentin Durward at school and Uncle Ezekiel sometimes tried<br>to incite me to read Ruskin and Carlyle. But there were practically<br>no books in our house. Father had never read a book in his life,<br>except the Bible and Smiles's Self Help, and I didn't of my own<br>accord read a 'good' book till much later. I'm not sorry it<br>happened that way. I read the things I wanted to read, and I got<br>more out of them than I ever got out of the stuff they taught me at<br>school.<br><br>The old penny dreadfuls were already going out when I was a kid,<br>and I can barely remember them, but there was a regular line of<br>boys' weeklies, some of which still exist. The Buffalo Bill<br>stories have gone out, I think, and Nat Gould probably isn't read<br>any longer, but Nick Carter and Sexton Blake seem to be still the<br>same as ever. The Gem and the Magnet, if I'm remembering rightly,<br>started about 1905. The B.O.P. was still rather pi in those days,<br>but Chums, which I think must have started about 1903, was<br>splendid. Then there was an encyclopedia--I don't remember its<br>exact name--which was issued in penny numbers. It never seemed<br>quite worth buying, but a boy at school used to give away back<br>numbers sometimes. If I now know the length of the Mississippi or<br>the difference between an octopus and a cuttle-fish or the exact<br>composition of bell-metal, that's where I learned it from.<br><br>Joe never read. He was one of those boys who can go through years<br>of schooling and at the end of it are unable to read ten lines<br>consecutively. The sight of print made him feel sick. I've seen<br>him pick up one of my numbers of Chums, read a paragraph or two and<br>then turn away with just the same movement of disgust as a horse<br>when it smells stale hay. He tried to kick me out of reading, but<br>Mother and Father, who had decided that I was 'the clever one',<br>backed me up. They were rather proud that I showed a taste for<br>'book-learning', as they called it. But it was typical of both of<br>them that they were vaguely upset by my reading things like Chums<br>and the Union Jack, thought that I ought to read something<br>'improving' but didn't know enough about books to be sure which<br>books were 'improving'. Finally Mother got hold of a second-hand<br>copy of Foxe's Book of Martyrs, which I didn't read, though the<br>illustrations weren't half bad.<br><br>All through the winter of 1905 I spent a penny on Chums every week.<br>I was following up their serial story, 'Donovan the Dauntless'.<br>Donovan the Dauntless was an explorer who was employed by an<br>American millionaire to fetch incredible things from various<br>corners of the earth. Sometimes it was diamonds the size of golf<br>balls from the craters of volcanoes in Africa, sometimes it was<br>petrified mammoths' tusks from the frozen forests of Siberia,<br>sometimes it was buried Inca treasures from the lost cities of<br>Peru. Donovan went on a new journey every week, and he always made<br>good. My favourite place for reading was the loft behind the yard.<br>Except when Father was getting out fresh sacks of grain it was the<br>quietest place in the house. There were huge piles of sacks to lie<br>on, and a sort of plastery smell mixed up with the smell of<br>sainfoin, and bunches of cobwebs in all the corners, and just over<br>the place where I used to lie there was a hole in the ceiling and a<br>lath sticking out of the plaster. I can feel the feeling of it<br>now. A winter day, just warm enough to lie still. I'm lying on my<br>belly with Chums open in front of me. A mouse runs up the side of<br>a sack like a clockwork toy, then suddenly stops dead and watches<br>me with his little eyes like tiny jet beads. I'm twelve years old,<br>but I'm Donovan the Dauntless. Two thousand miles up the Amazon<br>I've just pitched my tent, and the roots of the mysterious orchid<br>that blooms once in a hundred years are safe in the tin box under<br>my camp bed. In the forests all round Hopi-Hopi Indians, who paint<br>their teeth scarlet and skin white men alive, are beating their<br>war-drums. I'm watching the mouse and the mouse is watching me,<br>and I can smell the dust and sainfoin and the cool plastery smell,<br>and I'm up the Amazon, and it's bliss, pure bliss. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/8.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/10.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
