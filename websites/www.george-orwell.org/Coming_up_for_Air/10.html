<h2>Part 2, Chapter 7</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">That's all, really.<br><br>I've tried to tell you something about the world before the war,<br>the world I got a sniff of when I saw King Zog's name on the<br>poster, and the chances are that I've told you nothing. Either you<br>remember before the war and don't need to be told about it, or you<br>don't remember, and it's no use telling you. So far I've only<br>spoken about the things that happened to me before I was sixteen.<br>Up to that time things had gone pretty well with the family. It<br>was a bit before my sixteenth birthday that I began to get glimpses<br>of what people call 'real life', meaning unpleasantness.<br><br>About three days after I'd seen the big carp at Binfield House,<br>Father came in to tea looking very worried and even more grey and<br>mealy than usual. He ate his way solemnly through his tea and<br>didn't talk much. In those days he had a rather preoccupied way of<br>eating, and his moustache used to work up and down with a sidelong<br>movement, because he hadn't many back teeth left. I was just<br>getting up from table when he called me back.<br><br>'Wait a minute, George, my boy. I got suthing to say to you. Sit<br>down jest a minute. Mother, you heard what I got to say last<br>night.'<br><br>Mother, behind the huge brown teapot, folded her hands in her lap<br>and looked solemn. Father went on, speaking very seriously but<br>rather spoiling the effect by trying to deal with a crumb that<br>lodged somewhere in what was left of his back teeth:<br><br>'George, my boy, I got suthing to say to you. I been thinking it<br>over, and it's about time you left school. 'Fraid you'll have to<br>get to work now and start earning a bit to bring home to your<br>mother. I wrote to Mr Wicksey last night and told him as I should<br>have to take you away.'<br><br>Of course this was quite according to precedent--his writing to Mr<br>Wicksey before telling me, I mean. Parents in those days, as a<br>matter of course, always arranged everything over their children's<br>heads.<br><br>Father went on to make some rather mumbling and worried explanations.<br>He'd 'had bad times lately', things had 'been a bit difficult',<br>and the upshot was that Joe and I would have to start earning<br>our living. At that time I didn't either know or greatly<br>care whether the business was really in a bad way or not. I hadn't<br>even enough commercial instinct to see the reason why things were<br>'difficult'. The fact was that Father had been hit by competition.<br>Sarazins', the big retail seedsmen who had branches all over the<br>home counties, had stuck a tentacle into Lower Binfield. Six<br>months earlier they'd taken the lease of a shop in the market-place<br>and dolled it up until what with bright green paint, gilt<br>lettering, gardening tools painted red and green, and huge<br>advertisements for sweet peas, it hit you in the eye at a hundred<br>yards' distance. Sarazins', besides selling flower seeds,<br>described themselves as 'universal poultry and livestock<br>providers', and apart from wheat and oats and so forth they went in<br>for patent poultry mixtures, bird-seed done up in fancy packets,<br>dog-biscuits of all shapes and colours, medicines, embrocations,<br>and conditioning powders, and branched off into such things as rat-<br>traps, dog-chains, incubators, sanitary eggs, bird-nesting, bulbs,<br>weed-killer, insecticide, and even, in some branches, into what<br>they called a 'livestock department', meaning rabbits and day-old<br>chicks. Father, with his dusty old shop and his refusal to stock<br>new lines, couldn't compete with that kind of thing and didn't want<br>to. The tradesmen with their van-horses, and such of the farmers<br>as dealt with the retail seedsmen, fought shy of Sarazins', but<br>in six months they'd gathered in the petty gentry of the<br>neighbourhood, who in those days had carriages or dogcarts and<br>therefore horses. This meant a big loss of trade for Father and<br>the other corn merchant, Winkle. I didn't grasp any of this at the<br>time. I had a boy's attitude towards it all. I'd never taken any<br>interest in the business. I'd never or hardly ever served in the<br>shop, and when, as occasionally happened, Father wanted me to run<br>an errand or give a hand with something, such as hoisting sacks of<br>grain up to the loft or down again, I'd always dodged it whenever<br>possible. Boys in our class aren't such complete babies as public<br>schoolboys, they know that work is work and sixpence is sixpence,<br>but it seems natural for a boy to regard his father's business as a<br>bore. Up till that time fishing-rods, bicycles, fizzy lemonade,<br>and so forth had seemed to me a good deal more real than anything<br>that happened in the grown-up world.<br><br>Father had already spoken to old Grimmett, the grocer, who wanted a<br>smart lad and was willing to take me into the shop immediately.<br>Meanwhile Father was going to get rid of the errand boy, and Joe<br>was to come home and help with the shop till he got a regular job.<br>Joe had left school some time back and had been more or less<br>loafing ever since. Father had sometimes talked of 'getting him<br>into' the accounts department at the brewery, and earlier had even<br>had thoughts of making him into an auctioneer. Both were<br>completely hopeless because Joe, at seventeen, wrote a hand like a<br>ploughboy and couldn't repeat the multiplication table. At present<br>he was supposed to be 'learning the trade' at a big bicycle shop on<br>the outskirts of Walton. Tinkering with bicycles suited Joe, who,<br>like most half-wits, had a slight mechanical turn, but he was quite<br>incapable of working steadily and spent all his time loafing about<br>in greasy overalls, smoking Woodbines, getting into fights,<br>drinking (he's started that already), getting 'talked of' with one<br>girl after another, and sticking Father for money. Father was<br>worried, puzzled, and vaguely resentful. I can see him yet, with<br>the meal on his bald head, and the bit of grey hair over his ears,<br>and his spectacles and his grey moustache. He couldn't understand<br>what was happening to him. For years his profits had gone up,<br>slowly and steadily, ten pounds this year, twenty pounds that year,<br>and now suddenly they'd gone down with a bump. He couldn't<br>understand it. He'd inherited the business from his father, he'd<br>done an honest trade, worked hard, sold sound goods, swindled<br>nobody--and his profits were going down. He said a number of<br>times, between sucking at his teeth to get the crumb out, that<br>times were very bad, trade seemed very slack, he couldn't think<br>what had come over people, it wasn't as if the horses didn't have<br>to eat. Perhaps it was these here motors, he decided finally.<br>'Nasty smelly things!' Mother put in. She was a little worried,<br>and knew that she ought to be more so. Once or twice while Father<br>was talking there was a far-away look in her eyes and I could see<br>her lips moving. She was trying to decide whether it should be a<br>round of beef and carrots tomorrow or another leg of mutton.<br>Except when there was something in her own line that needed<br>foresight, such as buying linen or saucepans, she wasn't really<br>capable of thinking beyond tomorrow's meals. The shop was giving<br>trouble and Father was worried--that was about as far as she saw<br>into it. None of us had any grasp of what was happening. Father<br>had had a bad year and lost money, but was he really frightened by<br>the future? I don't think so. This was 1909, remember. He didn't<br>know what was happening to him, he wasn't capable of foreseeing<br>that these Sarazin people would systematically under-sell him, ruin<br>him, and eat him up. How could he? Things hadn't happened like<br>that when he was a young man. All he knew was that times were bad,<br>trade was very 'slack', very 'slow' (he kept repeating these<br>phrases), but probably things would 'look up presently'.<br><br>It would be nice if I could tell you that I was a great help to my<br>father in his time of trouble, suddenly proved myself a man, and<br>developed qualities which no one had suspected in me--and so on and<br>so forth, like the stuff you used to read in the uplift novels of<br>thirty years ago. Or alternatively I'd like to be able to record<br>that I bitterly resented having to leave school, my eager young<br>mind, yearning for knowledge and refinement, recoiled from the<br>soulless mechanical job into which they were thrusting me--and so<br>on and so forth, like the stuff you read in the uplift novels<br>today. Both would be complete bunkum. The truth is that I was<br>pleased and excited at the idea of going to work, especially when I<br>grasped that Old Grimmett was going to pay me real wages, twelve<br>shillings a week, of which I could keep four for myself. The big<br>carp at Binfield House, which had filled my mind for three days<br>past, faded right out of it. I'd no objection to leaving school a<br>few terms early. It generally happened the same way with boys at<br>our school. A boy was always 'going to' go to Reading University,<br>or study to be an engineer, or 'go into business' in London, or run<br>away to sea--and then suddenly, at two days' notice, he'd disappear<br>from school, and a fortnight later you'd meet him on a bicycle,<br>delivering vegetables. Within five minutes of Father telling me<br>that I should have to leave school I was wondering about the new<br>suit I should wear to go to work in. I instantly started demanding<br>a 'grown-up suit', with a kind of coat that was fashionable at that<br>time, a 'cutaway', I think it was called. Of course both Mother<br>and Father were scandalized and said they'd 'never heard of such a<br>thing'. For some reason that I've never fully fathomed, parents in<br>those days always tried to prevent their children wearing grown-up<br>clothes as long as possible. In every family there was a stand-up<br>fight before a boy had his first tall collars or a girl put her<br>hair up.<br><br>So the conversation veered away from Father's business troubles and<br>degenerated into a long, nagging kind of argument, with Father<br>gradually getting angry and repeating over and over--dropping an<br>aitch now and again, as he was apt to do when he got angry--'Well,<br>you can't 'ave it. Make up your mind to that--you can't 'ave it.'<br>So I didn't have my 'cutaway', but went to work for the first time<br>in a ready-made black suit and a broad collar in which I looked an<br>overgrown lout. Any distress I felt over the whole business really<br>arose from that. Joe was even more selfish about it. He was<br>furious at having to leave the bicycle shop, and for the short time<br>that he remained at home he merely loafed about, made a nuisance of<br>himself and was no help to Father whatever.<br><br>I worked in old Grimmett's shop for nearly six years. Grimmett was<br>a fine, upstanding, white-whiskered old chap, like a rather stouter<br>version of Uncle Ezekiel, and like Uncle Ezekiel a good Liberal.<br>But he was less of a firebrand and more respected in the town.<br>He'd trimmed his sails during the Boer War, he was a bitter enemy<br>of trade unions and once sacked an assistant for possessing a<br>photograph of Keir Hardie, and he was 'chapel'--in fact he was a<br>big noise, literally, in the Baptist Chapel, known locally as the<br>Tin Tab--whereas my family were 'church' and Uncle Ezekiel was an<br>infidel at that. Old Grimmett was a town councillor and an<br>official at the local Liberal Party. With his white whiskers, his<br>canting talk about liberty of conscience and the Grand Old Man, his<br>thumping bank balance, and the extempore prayers you could<br>sometimes hear him letting loose when you passed the Tin Tab, he<br>was a little like a legendary Nonconformist grocer in the story--<br>you've heard it, I expect:<br><br>'James!'<br><br>'Yessir?'<br><br>'Have you sanded the sugar?'<br><br>'Yessir!'<br><br>'Have you watered the treacle?'<br><br>'Yessir!'<br><br>'Then come up to prayers.'<br><br>God knows how often I heard that story whispered in the shop. We<br>did actually start the day with a prayer before we put up the<br>shutters. Not that old Grimmett sanded the sugar. He knew that<br>that doesn't pay. But he was a sharp man in business, he did all<br>the high-class grocery trade of Lower Binfield and the country<br>round, and he had three assistants in the shop besides the errand<br>boy, the van-man, and his own daughter (he was a widower) who acted<br>as cashier. I was the errand boy for my first six months. Then<br>one of the assistants left to 'set up' in Reading and I moved into<br>the shop and wore my first white apron. I learned to tie a parcel,<br>pack a bag of currants, grind coffee, work the bacon-slicer, carve<br>ham, put an edge on a knife, sweep the floor, dust eggs without<br>breaking them, pass off an inferior article as a good one, clean a<br>window, judge a pound of cheese by eye, open a packing-case, whack<br>a slab of butter into shape, and--what was a good deal the hardest--<br>remember where the stock was kept. I haven't such detailed<br>memories of grocering as I have of fishing, but I remember a good<br>deal. To this day I know the trick of snapping a bit of string in<br>my fingers. If you put me in front of a bacon-slicer I could work<br>it better than I can a typewriter. I could spin you some pretty<br>fair technicalities about grades of China tea and what margarine is<br>made of and the average weight of eggs and the price of paper bags<br>per thousand.<br><br>Well, for more than five years that was me--an alert young chap<br>with a round, pink, snubby kind of face and butter-coloured hair<br>(no longer cut short but carefully greased and slicked back in what<br>people used to call a 'smarm'), hustling about behind the counter<br>in a white apron with a pencil behind my ear, tying up bags of<br>coffee like lightning and jockeying the customer along with 'Yes,<br>ma'am! Certainly, ma'am! AND the next order, ma'am!' in a voice<br>with just a trace of a Cockney accent. Old Grimmett worked us<br>pretty hard, it was an eleven-hour day except on Thursdays and<br>Sundays, and Christmas week was a nightmare. Yet it's a good time<br>to look back on. Don't think that I had no ambitions. I knew I<br>wasn't going to remain a grocer's assistant for ever, I was merely<br>'learning the trade'. Some time, somehow or other, there'd be<br>enough money for me to 'set up' on my own. That was how people<br>felt in those days. This was before the war, remember, and before<br>the slumps and before the dole. The world was big enough for<br>everyone. Anyone could 'set up in trade', there was always room<br>for another shop. And time was slipping on. 1909, 1910, 1911.<br>King Edward died and the papers came out with a black border round<br>the edge. Two cinemas opened in Walton. The cars got commoner on<br>the roads and cross-country motor-buses began to run. An<br>aeroplane--a flimsy, rickety-looking thing with a chap sitting in<br>the middle on a kind of chair--flew over Lower Binfield and the<br>whole town rushed out of their houses to yell at it. People began<br>to say rather vaguely that this here German Emperor was getting too<br>big for his boots and 'it' (meaning war with Germany) was 'coming<br>some time'. My wages went gradually up, until finally, just before<br>the war, they were twenty-eight shillings a week. I paid Mother<br>ten shillings a week for my board, and later, when times got worse,<br>fifteen shillings, and even that left me feeling richer than I've<br>felt since. I grew another inch, my moustache began to sprout, I<br>wore button boots and collars three inches high. In church on<br>Sundays, in my natty dark grey suit, with my bowler hat and black<br>dogskin gloves on the pew beside me, I looked the perfect gent, so<br>that Mother could hardly contain her pride in me. In between work<br>and 'walking out' on Thursdays, and thinking about clothes and<br>girls, I had fits of ambition and saw myself developing into a Big<br>Business Man like Lever or William Whiteley. Between sixteen and<br>eighteen I made serious efforts to 'improve my mind' and train<br>myself for a business career. I cured myself of dropping aitches<br>and got rid of most of my Cockney accent. (In the Thames Valley<br>the country accents were going out. Except for the farm lads,<br>nearly everyone who was born later than 1890 talked Cockney.) I<br>did a correspondence course with Littleburns' Commercial Academy,<br>learnt bookkeeping and business English, read solemnly through a<br>book of frightful blah called The Art of Salesmanship, and improved<br>my arithmetic and even my handwriting. When I was as old as<br>seventeen I've sat up late at night with my tongue hanging out of<br>my mouth, practising copperplate by the little oil-lamp on the<br>bedroom table. At times I read enormously, generally crime and<br>adventure stories, and sometimes paper-covered books which were<br>furtively passed round by the chaps at the shop and described as<br>'hot'. (They were translations of Maupassant and Paul de Kock.)<br>But when I was eighteen I suddenly turned highbrow, got a ticket<br>for the County Library, and began to stodge through books by Marie<br>Corelli and Hall Caine and Anthony Hope. It was at about that time<br>that I joined the Lower Binfield Reading Circle, which was run by<br>the vicar and met one evening a week all through the winter for<br>what was called 'literary discussion'. Under pressure from the<br>vicar I read bits of Sesame and Lilies and even had a go at<br>Browning.<br><br>And time was slipping away. 1910, 1911, 1912. And Father's<br>business was going down--not slumping suddenly into the gutter, but<br>it was going down. Neither Father nor Mother was ever quite the<br>same after Joe ran away from home. This happened not long after I<br>went to work at Grimmett's.<br><br>Joe, at eighteen, had grown into an ugly ruffian. He was a hefty<br>chap, much bigger than the rest of the family, with tremendous<br>shoulders, a big head, and a sulky, lowering kind of face on which<br>he already had a respectable moustache. When he wasn't in the tap-<br>room of the George he was loafing in the shop doorway, with his<br>hands dug deep into his pockets, scowling at the people who passed,<br>except when they happened to be girls, as though he'd like to knock<br>them down. If anyone came into the shop he'd move aside just<br>enough to let them pass, and, without taking his hands out of his<br>pockets, yell over his shoulders 'Da-ad! Shop!' This was as near<br>as he ever got to helping. Father and Mother said despairingly<br>that they 'didn't know what to do with him', and he was costing the<br>devil of a lot with his drinking and endless smoking. Late one<br>night he walked out of the house and was never heard of again.<br>He'd prised open the till and taken all the money that was in it,<br>luckily not much, about eight pounds. That was enough to get him a<br>steerage passage to America. He'd always wanted to go to America,<br>and I think he probably did so, though we never knew for certain.<br>It made a bit of a scandal in the town. The official theory was<br>that Joe had bolted because he'd put a girl in the family way.<br>There was a girl named Sally Chivers who lived in the same street<br>as the Simmonses and was going to have a baby, and Joe had<br>certainly been with her, but so had about a dozen others, and<br>nobody knew whose baby it was. Mother and Father accepted the baby<br>theory and even, in private, used it to excuse their 'poor boy' for<br>stealing the eight pounds and running away. They weren't capable<br>of grasping that Joe had cleared out because he couldn't stand a<br>decent respectable life in a little country town and wanted a life<br>of loafing, fights, and women. We never heard of him again.<br>Perhaps he went utterly to the bad, perhaps he was killed in the<br>war, perhaps he merely didn't bother to write. Luckily the baby<br>was born dead, so there were no complications. As for the fact<br>that Joe had stolen the eight pounds, Mother and Father managed to<br>keep it a secret till they died. In their eyes it was a much worse<br>disgrace than Sally Chivers's baby.<br><br>The trouble over Joe aged Father a great deal. To lose Joe was<br>merely to cut a loss, but it hurt him and made him ashamed. From<br>that time forward his moustache was much greyer and he seemed to<br>have grown a lot smaller. Perhaps my memory of him as a little<br>grey man, with a round, lined, anxious face and dusty spectacles,<br>really dates from that time. By slow degrees he was getting more<br>and more involved in money worries and less and less interested in<br>other things. He talked less about politics and the Sunday papers,<br>and more about the badness of trade. Mother seemed to have shrunk<br>a little, too. In my childhood I'd known her as something vast and<br>overflowing, with her yellow hair and her beaming face and her<br>enormous bosom, a sort of great opulent creature like the figure-<br>head of a battleship. Now she'd got smaller and more anxious and<br>older than her years. She was less lordly in the kitchen, went in<br>more for neck of mutton, worried over the price of coal, and began<br>to use margarine, a thing which in the old days she'd never have<br>allowed into the house. After Joe had gone Father had to hire an<br>errand boy again, but from then on he employed very young boys whom<br>he only kept for a year or two and who couldn't lift heavy weights.<br>I sometimes lent him a hand when I was at home. I was too selfish<br>to do it regularly. I can still see him working his way slowly<br>across the yard, bent double and almost hidden under an enormous<br>sack, like a snail under its shell. The huge, monstrous sack,<br>weighing a hundred and fifty pounds, I suppose, pressing his neck<br>and shoulders almost to the ground, and the anxious, spectacled<br>face looking up from underneath it. In 1911 he ruptured himself<br>and had to spend weeks in hospital and hire a temporary manager<br>for the shop, which ate another hole in his capital. A small<br>shopkeeper going down the hill is a dreadful thing to watch, but it<br>isn't sudden and obvious like the fate of a working man who gets<br>the sack and promptly finds himself on the dole. It's just a<br>gradual chipping away of trade, with little ups and downs, a few<br>shillings to the bad here, a few sixpences to the good there.<br>Somebody who's dealt with you for years suddenly deserts and goes<br>to Sarazins'. Somebody else buys a dozen hens and gives you a<br>weekly order for corn. You can still keep going. You're still<br>'your own master', always a little more worried and a little<br>shabbier, with your capital shrinking all the time. You can go on<br>like that for years, for a lifetime if you're lucky. Uncle Ezekiel<br>died in 1911, leaving 120 pounds which must have made a lot of<br>difference to Father. It wasn't till 1913 that he had to mortgage<br>his life-insurance policy. That I didn't hear about at the time,<br>or I'd have understood what it meant. As it was I don't think I<br>ever got further than realizing that Father 'wasn't doing well',<br>trade was 'slack', there'd be a bit longer to wait before I had the<br>money to 'set up'. Like Father himself, I looked on the shop as<br>something permanent, and I was a bit inclined to be angry with him<br>for not managing things better. I wasn't capable of seeing, and<br>neither was he nor anyone else, that he was being slowly ruined,<br>that his business would never pick up again and if he lived to be<br>seventy he'd certainly end in the workhouse. Many a time I've<br>passed Sarazins' shop in the market-place and merely thought how<br>much I preferred their slick window-front to Father's dusty old<br>shop, with the 'S. Bowling' which you could hardly read, the<br>chipped white lettering, and the faded packets of bird-seed. It<br>didn't occur to me that Sarazins' were tapeworms who were eating<br>him alive. Sometimes I used to repeat to him some of the stuff<br>I'd been reading in my correspondence-course textbooks, about<br>salesmanship and modern methods. He never paid much attention.<br>He'd inherited an old-established business, he'd always worked<br>hard, done a fair trade, and supplied sound goods, and things would<br>look up presently. It's a fact that very few shopkeepers in those<br>days actually ended in the workhouse. With any luck you died with<br>a few pounds still your own. It was a race between death and<br>bankruptcy, and, thank God, death got Father first, and Mother too.<br><br>1911, 1912, 1913. I tell you it was a good time to be alive. It<br>was late in 1912, through the vicar's Reading Circle, that I first<br>met Elsie Waters. Till then, although, like all the rest of the<br>boys in the town, I'd gone out looking for girls and occasionally<br>managed to connect up with this girl or that and 'walk out' a few<br>Sunday afternoons, I'd never really had a girl of my own. It's a<br>queer business, that chasing of girls when you're about sixteen.<br>At some recognized part of the town the boys stroll up and down in<br>pairs, watching the girls, and the girls stroll up and down in<br>pairs, pretending not to notice the boys, and presently some kind<br>of contact is established and instead of twos they're trailing<br>along in fours, all four utterly speechless. The chief feature of<br>those walks--and it was worse the second time, when you went out<br>with the girl alone--was the ghastly failure to make any kind of<br>conversation. But Elsie Waters seemed different. The truth was<br>that I was growing up.<br><br>I don't want to tell the story of myself and Elsie Waters, even if<br>there was any story to tell. It's merely that she's part of the<br>picture, part of 'before the war'. Before the war it was always<br>summer--a delusion, as I've remarked before, but that's how I<br>remember it. the white dusty road stretching out between the<br>chestnut trees, the smell of night-stocks, the green pools under<br>the willows, the splash of Burford Weir--that's what I see when I<br>shut my eyes and think of 'before the war', and towards the end<br>Elsie Waters is part of it.<br><br>I don't know whether Elsie would be considered pretty now. She was<br>then. She was tall for a girl, about as tall as I am, with pale<br>gold, heavy kind of hair which she wore somehow plaited and coiled<br>round her head, and a delicate, curiously gentle face. She was one<br>of those girls that always look their best in black, especially the<br>very plain black dresses they made them wear in the drapery--she<br>worked at Lilywhite's, the drapers, though she came originally from<br>London. I suppose she would have been two years older than I was.<br><br>I'm grateful to Elsie, because she was the first person who taught<br>me to care about a woman. I don't mean women in general, I mean an<br>individual woman. I'd met her at the Reading Circle and hardly<br>noticed her, and then one day I went into Lilywhite's during<br>working hours, a thing I wouldn't normally have been able to do,<br>but as it happened we'd run out of butter muslin and old Grimmett<br>sent me to buy some. You know the atmosphere of a draper's shop.<br>It's something peculiarly feminine. There's a hushed feeling, a<br>subdued light, a cool smell of cloth, and a faint whirring from the<br>wooden balls of change rolling to and fro. Elsie was leaning<br>against the counter, cutting off a length of cloth with the big<br>scissors. There was something about her black dress and the curve<br>of her breast against the counter--I can't describe it, something<br>curiously soft, curiously feminine. As soon as you saw her you<br>knew that you could take her in your arms and do what you wanted<br>with her. She was really deeply feminine, very gentle, very<br>submissive, the kind that would always do what a man told her,<br>though she wasn't either small or weak. She wasn't even stupid,<br>only rather silent and, at times, dreadfully refined. But in those<br>days I was rather refined myself.<br><br>We were living together for about a year. Of course in a town like<br>Lower Binfield you could only live together in a figurative sense.<br>Officially we were 'walking out', which was a recognized custom and<br>not quite the same as being engaged. There was a road that<br>branched off from the road to Upper Binfield and ran along under<br>the edge of the hills. There was a long stretch of it, nearly a<br>mile, that was quite straight and fringed with enormous horse-<br>chestnut trees, and on the grass at the side there was a footpath<br>under the boughs that was known as Lovers' Lane. We used to go<br>there on the May evenings, when the chestnuts were in blossom.<br>Then the short nights came on, and it was light for hours after<br>we'd left the shop. You know the feeling of a June evening. The<br>kind of blue twilight that goes on and on, and the air brushing<br>against your face like silk. Sometimes on Sunday afternoons we<br>went over Chamford Hill and down to the water-meadows along the<br>Thames. 1913! My God! 1913! The stillness, the green water, the<br>rushing of the weir! It'll never come again. I don't mean that<br>1913 will never come again. I mean the feeling inside you, the<br>feeling of not being in a hurry and not being frightened, the<br>feeling you've either had and don't need to be told about, or<br>haven't had and won't ever have the chance to learn.<br><br>It wasn't till late summer that we began what's called living<br>together. I'd been too shy and clumsy to begin, and too ignorant<br>to realize that there'd been others before me. One Sunday<br>afternoon we went into the beech woods round Upper Binfield. Up<br>there you could always be alone. I wanted her very badly, and I<br>knew quite well that she was only waiting for me to begin.<br>Something, I don't know what, put it into my head to go into the<br>grounds of Binfield House. Old Hodges, who was past seventy and<br>getting very crusty, was capable of turning us out, but he'd<br>probably be asleep on a Sunday afternoon. We slipped through a gap<br>in the fence and down the footpath between the beeches to the big<br>pool. It was four years or more since I'd been that way. Nothing<br>had changed. Still the utter solitude, the hidden feeling with the<br>great trees all round you, the old boat-house rotting among the<br>bulrushes. We lay down in the little grass hollow beside the wild<br>peppermint, and we were as much alone as if we'd been in Central<br>Africa. I'd kissed her God knows how many times, and then I'd got<br>up and was wandering about again. I wanted her very badly, and<br>wanted to take the plunge, only I was half-frightened. And<br>curiously enough there was another thought in my mind at the same<br>time. It suddenly struck me that for years I'd meant to come back<br>here and had never come. Now I was so near, it seemed a pity not<br>to go down to the other pool and have a look at the big carp. I<br>felt I'd kick myself afterwards if I missed the chance, in fact I<br>couldn't think why I hadn't been back before. The carp were stored<br>away in my mind, nobody knew about them except me, I was going to<br>catch them some time. Practically they were MY carp. I actually<br>started wandering along the bank in that direction, and then when<br>I'd gone about ten yards I turned back. It meant crashing your way<br>through a kind of jungle of brambles and rotten brushwood, and I<br>was dressed up in my Sunday best. Dark-grey suit, bowler hat,<br>button boots, and a collar that almost cut my ears off. That was<br>how people dressed for Sunday afternoon walks in those days. And I<br>wanted Elsie very badly. I went back and stood over her for a<br>moment. She was lying on the grass with her arm over her face, and<br>she didn't stir when she heard me come. In her black dress she<br>looked--I don't know how, kind of soft, kind of yielding, as though<br>her body was a kind of malleable stuff that you could do what you<br>liked with. She was mine and I could have her, this minute if I<br>wanted to. Suddenly I stopped being frightened, I chucked my hat<br>on to the grass (it bounced, I remember), knelt down, and took hold<br>of her. I can smell the wild peppermint yet. It was my first<br>time, but it wasn't hers, and we didn't make such a mess of it as<br>you might expect. So that was that. The big carp faded out of my<br>mind again, and in fact for years afterwards I hardly thought about<br>them.<br><br>1913. 1914. The spring of 1914. First the blackthorn, then the<br>hawthorn, then the chestnuts in blossom. Sunday afternoons along<br>the towpath, and the wind rippling the beds of rushes so that they<br>swayed all together in great thick masses and looked somehow like a<br>woman's hair. The endless June evenings, the path under the<br>chestnut trees, an owl hooting somewhere and Elsie's body against<br>me. It was a hot July that year. How we sweated in the shop, and<br>how the cheese and the ground coffee smelt! And then the cool of<br>the evening outside, the smell of night-stocks and pipe-tobacco in<br>the lane behind the allotments, the soft dust underfoot, and the<br>nightjars hawking after the cockchafers.<br><br>Christ! What's the use of saying that one oughtn't to be sentimental<br>about 'before the war'? I AM sentimental about it. So are you if<br>you remember it. It's quite true that if you look back on any<br>special period of time you tend to remember the pleasant bits.<br>That's true even of the war. But it's also true that people then<br>had something that we haven't got now.<br><br>What? It was simply that they didn't think of the future as<br>something to be terrified of. It isn't that life was softer then<br>than now. Actually it was harsher. People on the whole worked<br>harder, lived less comfortably, and died more painfully. The farm<br>hands worked frightful hours for fourteen shillings a week and<br>ended up as worn-out cripples with a five-shilling old-age pension<br>and an occasional half-crown from the parish. And what was called<br>'respectable' poverty was even worse. When little Watson, a small<br>draper at the other end of the High Street, 'failed' after years of<br>struggling, his personal assets were L2 9s. 6d., and he died almost<br>immediately of what was called 'gastric trouble', but the doctor<br>let it out that it was starvation. Yet he'd clung to his frock<br>coat to the last. Old Crimp, the watchmaker's assistant, a skilled<br>workman who'd been at the job, man and boy, for fifty years, got<br>cataract and had to go into the workhouse. His grandchildren were<br>howling in the street when they took him away. His wife went out<br>charing, and by desperate efforts managed to send him a shilling a<br>week for pocket-money. You saw ghastly things happening sometimes.<br>Small businesses sliding down the hill, solid tradesmen turning<br>gradually into broken-down bankrupts, people dying by inches of<br>cancer and liver disease, drunken husbands signing the pledge every<br>Monday and breaking it every Saturday, girls ruined for life by an<br>illegitimate baby. The houses had no bathrooms, you broke the ice<br>in your basin on winter mornings, the back streets stank like the<br>devil in hot weather, and the churchyard was bang in the middle of<br>the town, so that you never went a day without remembering how<br>you'd got to end. And yet what was it that people had in those<br>days? A feeling of security, even when they weren't secure. More<br>exactly, it was a feeling of continuity. All of them knew they'd<br>got to die, and I suppose a few of them knew they were going to go<br>bankrupt, but what they didn't know was that the order of things<br>could change. Whatever might happen to themselves, things would go<br>on as they'd known them. I don't believe it made very much<br>difference that what's called religious belief was still prevalent<br>in those days. It's true that nearly everyone went to church, at<br>any rate in the country--Elsie and I still went to church as a<br>matter of course, even when we were living in what the vicar would<br>have called sin--and if you asked people whether they believed in a<br>life after death they generally answered that they did. But I've<br>never met anyone who gave me the impression of really believing in<br>a future life. I think that, at most, people believe in that kind<br>of thing in the same way as kids believe in Father Christmas. But<br>it's precisely in a settled period, a period when civilization<br>seems to stand on its four legs like an elephant, that such things<br>as a future life don't matter. It's easy enough to die if the<br>things you care about are going to survive. You've had your life,<br>you're getting tired, it's time to go underground--that's how<br>people used to see it. Individually they were finished, but their<br>way of life would continue. Their good and evil would remain good<br>and evil. They didn't feel the ground they stood on shifting under<br>their feet.<br><br>Father was failing, and he didn't know it. It was merely that<br>times were very bad, trade seemed to dwindle and dwindle, his bills<br>were harder and harder to meet. Thank God, he never even knew that<br>he was ruined, never actually went bankrupt, because he died very<br>suddenly (it was influenza that turned into pneumonia) at the<br>beginning of 1915. To the end he believed that with thrift, hard<br>work, and fair dealing a man can't go wrong. There must have been<br>plenty of small shopkeepers who carried that belief not merely on<br>to bankrupt deathbeds but even into the workhouse. Even Lovegrove<br>the saddler, with cars and motor-vans staring him in the face,<br>didn't realize that he was as out of date as the rhinoceros. And<br>Mother too--Mother never lived to know that the life she'd been<br>brought up to, the life of a decent God-fearing shopkeeper's<br>daughter and a decent God-fearing shopkeeper's wife in the reign<br>of good Queen Vic, was finished for ever. Times were difficult<br>and trade was bad, Father was worried and this and that was<br>'aggravating', but you carried on much the same as usual. The old<br>English order of life couldn't change. For ever and ever decent<br>God-fearing women would cook Yorkshire pudding and apple dumplings<br>on enormous coal ranges, wear woollen underclothes and sleep on<br>feathers, make plum jam in July and pickles in October, and read<br>Hilda's Home Companion in the afternoons, with the flies buzzing<br>round, in a sort of cosy little underworld of stewed tea, bad legs,<br>and happy endings. I don't say that either Father or Mother was<br>quite the same to the end. They were a bit shaken, and sometimes a<br>little dispirited. But at least they never lived to know that<br>everything they'd believed in was just so much junk. They lived at<br>the end of an epoch, when everything was dissolving into a sort of<br>ghastly flux, and they didn't know it. They thought it was<br>eternity. You couldn't blame them. That was what it felt like.<br><br>Then came the end of July, and even Lower Binfield grasped that<br>things were happening. For days there was tremendous vague<br>excitement and endless leading articles in the papers, which Father<br>actually brought in from the shop to read aloud to Mother. And<br>then suddenly the posters everywhere:<br><br><br>GERMAN ULTIMATUM. FRANCE MOBILIZING<br><br><br>For several days (four days, wasn't it? I forget the exact dates)<br>there was a strange stifled feeling, a kind of waiting hush, like<br>the moment before a thunderstorm breaks, as though the whole of<br>England was silent and listening. It was very hot, I remember. In<br>the shop it was as though we couldn't work, though already everyone<br>in the neighbourhood who had five bob to spare was rushing in to<br>buy quantities of tinned stuff and flour and oatmeal. It was as if<br>we were too feverish to work, we only sweated and waited. In the<br>evenings people went down to the railway station and fought like<br>devils over the evening papers which arrived on the London train.<br>And then one afternoon a boy came rushing down the High Street with<br>an armful of papers, and people were coming into their doorways to<br>shout across the street. Everyone was shouting 'We've come in!<br>We've come in!' The boy grabbed a poster from his bundle and stuck<br>it on the shop-front opposite:<br><br><br>ENGLAND DECLARES WAR ON GERMANY<br><br><br>We rushed out on to the pavement, all three assistants, and<br>cheered. Everybody was cheering. Yes, cheering. But old<br>Grimmett, though he'd already done pretty well out of the war-<br>scare, still held on to a little of his Liberal principles, 'didn't<br>hold' with the war, and said it would be a bad business.<br><br>Two months later I was in the Army. Seven months later I was in<br>France. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/9.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/11.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
