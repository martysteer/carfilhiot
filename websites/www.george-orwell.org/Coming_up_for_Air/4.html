<h2>Part 2, Chapter 1</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The world I momentarily remembered when I saw King Zog's name on<br>the poster was so different from the world I live in now that you<br>might have a bit of difficulty in believing I ever belonged to it.<br><br>I suppose by this time you've got a kind of picture of me in your<br>mind--a fat middle-aged bloke with false teeth and a red face--and<br>subconsciously you've been imagining that I was just the same even<br>when I was in my cradle. But forty-five years is a long time, and<br>though some people don't change and develop, others do. I've<br>changed a great deal, and I've had my ups and downs, mostly ups.<br>It may seem queer, but my father would probably be rather proud of<br>me if he could see me now. He'd think it a wonderful thing that a<br>son of his should own a motor-car and live in a house with a<br>bathroom. Even now I'm a little above my origin, and at other<br>times I've touched levels that we should never have dreamed of in<br>those old days before the war.<br><br>Before the war! How long shall we go on saying that, I wonder?<br>How long before the answer will be 'Which war?' In my case the<br>never-never land that people are thinking of when they say 'before<br>the war' might almost be before the Boer War. I was born in '93,<br>and I can actually remember the outbreak of the Boer War, because<br>of the first-class row that Father and Uncle Ezekiel had about it.<br>I've several other memories that would date from about a year<br>earlier than that.<br><br>The very first thing I remember is the smell of sainfoin chaff.<br>You went up the stone passage that led from the kitchen to the<br>shop, and the smell of sainfoin got stronger all the way. Mother<br>had fixed a wooden gate in the doorway to prevent Joe and myself<br>(Joe was my elder brother) from getting into the shop. I can still<br>remember standing there clutching the bars, and the smell of<br>sainfoin mixed up with the damp plastery smell that belonged to the<br>passage. It wasn't till years later that I somehow managed to<br>crash the gate and get into the shop when nobody was there. A<br>mouse that had been having a go at one of the meal-bins suddenly<br>plopped out and ran between my feet. It was quite white with meal.<br>This must have happened when I was about six.<br><br>When you're very young you seem to suddenly become conscious of<br>things that have been under your nose for a long time past. The<br>things round about you swim into your mind one at a time, rather as<br>they do when you're waking from sleep. For instance, it was only<br>when I was nearly four that I suddenly realized that we owned a<br>dog. Nailer, his name was, an old white English terrier of the<br>breed that's gone out nowadays. I met him under the kitchen table<br>and in some way seemed to grasp, having only learnt it that moment,<br>that he belonged to us and that his name was Nailer. In the same<br>way, a bit earlier, I'd discovered that beyond the gate at the end<br>of the passage there was a place where the smell of sainfoin came<br>from. And the shop itself, with the huge scales and the wooden<br>measures and the tin shovel, and the white lettering on the window,<br>and the bullfinch in its cage--which you couldn't see very well<br>even from the pavement, because the window was always dusty--all<br>these things dropped into place in my mind one by one, like bits of<br>a jig-saw puzzle.<br><br>Time goes on, you get stronger on your legs, and by degrees you<br>begin to get a grasp of geography. I suppose Lower Binfield was<br>just like any other market town of about two thousand inhabitants.<br>It was in Oxfordshire--I keep saying WAS, you notice, though after<br>all the place still exists--about five miles from the Thames. It<br>lay in a bit of a valley, with a low ripple of hills between itself<br>and the Thames, and higher hills behind. On top of the hills there<br>were woods in sort of dim blue masses among which you could see a<br>great white house with a colonnade. This was Binfield House ('The<br>Hall', everybody called it), and the top of the hill was known as<br>Upper Binfield, though there was no village there and hadn't been<br>for a hundred years or more. I must have been nearly seven before<br>I noticed the existence of Binfield House. When you're very small<br>you don't look into the distance. But by that time I knew every<br>inch of the town, which was shaped roughly like a cross with the<br>market-place in the middle. Our shop was in the High Street a<br>little before you got to the market-place, and on the corner there<br>was Mrs Wheeler's sweet-shop where you spent a halfpenny when you<br>had one. Mother Wheeler was a dirty old witch and people suspected<br>her of sucking the bull's-eyes and putting them back in the bottle,<br>though this was never proved. Farther down there was the barber's<br>shop with the advert for Abdulla cigarettes--the one with the<br>Egyptian soldiers on it, and curiously enough they're using the<br>same advert to this day--and the rich boozy smell of bay rum and<br>latakia. Behind the houses you could see the chimneys of the<br>brewery. In the middle of the market-place there was the stone<br>horse-trough, and on top of the water there was always a fine film<br>of dust and chaff.<br><br>Before the war, and especially before the Boer War, it was summer<br>all the year round. I'm quite aware that that's a delusion. I'm<br>merely trying to tell you how things come back to me. If I shut my<br>eyes and think of Lower Binfield any time before I was, say, eight,<br>it's always in summer weather that I remember it. Either it's the<br>market-place at dinner-time, with a sort of sleepy dusty hush over<br>everything and the carrier's horse with his nose dug well into his<br>nose-bag, munching away, or it's a hot afternoon in the great green<br>juicy meadows round the town, or it's about dusk in the lane behind<br>the allotments, and there's a smell of pipe-tobacco and night-<br>stocks floating through the hedge. But in a sense I do remember<br>different seasons, because all my memories are bound up with things<br>to eat, which varied at different times of the year. Especially<br>the things you used to find in the hedges. In July there were<br>dewberries--but they're very rare--and the blackberries were<br>getting red enough to eat. In September there were sloes and<br>hazel-nuts. The best hazelnuts were always out of reach. Later on<br>there were beech-nuts and crab-apples. Then there were the kind of<br>minor foods that you used to eat when there was nothing better<br>going. Haws--but they're not much good--and hips, which have a<br>nice sharp taste if you clean the hairs out of them. Angelica is<br>good in early summer, especially when you're thirsty, and so are<br>the stems of various grasses. Then there's sorrel, which is good<br>with bread and butter, and pig-nuts, and a kind of wood shamrock<br>which has a sour taste. Even plantain seeds are better than<br>nothing when you're a long way from home and very hungry.<br><br>Joe was two years older than myself. When we were very small<br>Mother used to pay Katie Simmons eighteen pence a week to take us<br>out for walks in the afternoons. Katie's father worked in the<br>brewery and had fourteen children, so that the family were always<br>on the lookout for odd jobs. She was only twelve when Joe was<br>seven and I was five, and her mental level wasn't very different<br>from ours. She used to drag me by the arm and call me 'Baby', and<br>she had just enough authority over us to prevent us from being run<br>over by dogcarts or chased by bulls, but so far as conversation<br>went we were almost on equal terms. We used to go for long,<br>trailing kind of walks--always, of course, picking and eating<br>things all the way--down the lane past the allotments, across<br>Roper's Meadows, and down to the Mill Farm, where there was a pool<br>with newts and tiny carp in it (Joe and I used to go fishing there<br>when we were a bit older), and back by the Upper Binfield Road so<br>as to pass the sweet-shop that stood on the edge of the town. This<br>shop was in such a bad position that anyone who took it went<br>bankrupt, and to my own knowledge it was three times a sweet-shop,<br>once a grocer's, and once a bicycle-repair shop, but it had a<br>peculiar fascination for children. Even when we had no money, we'd<br>go that way so as to glue our noses against the window. Katie<br>wasn't in the least above sharing a farthing's worth of sweets and<br>quarrelling over her share. You could buy things worth having for<br>a farthing in those days. Most sweets were four ounces a penny,<br>and there was even some stuff called Paradise Mixture, mostly<br>broken sweets from other bottles, which was six. Then there were<br>Farthing Everlastings, which were a yard long and couldn't be<br>finished inside half an hour. Sugar mice and sugar pigs were eight<br>a penny, and so were liquorice pistols, popcorn was a halfpenny for<br>a large bag, and a prize packet which contained several different<br>kinds of sweets, a gold ring, and sometimes a whistle, was a penny.<br>You don't see prize packets nowadays. A whole lot of the kinds of<br>sweets we had in those days have gone out. There was a kind of<br>flat white sweet with mottoes printed on them, and also a kind of<br>sticky pink stuff in an oval matchwood box with a tiny tin spoon to<br>eat it with, which cost a halfpenny. Both of those have disappeared.<br>So have Caraway Comfits, and so have chocolate pipes and sugar<br>matches, and even Hundreds and Thousands you hardly ever see.<br>Hundreds and Thousands were a great standby when you'd only a<br>farthing. And what about Penny Monsters? Does one ever see a Penny<br>Monster nowadays? It was a huge bottle, holding more than a quart<br>of fizzy lemonade, all for a penny. That's another thing that the<br>war killed stone dead.<br><br>It always seems to be summer when I look back. I can feel the<br>grass round me as tall as myself, and the heat coming out of the<br>earth. And the dust in the lane, and the warm greeny light coming<br>through the hazel boughs. I can see the three of us trailing<br>along, eating stuff out of the hedge, with Katie dragging at my arm<br>and saying 'Come on, Baby!' and sometimes yelling ahead to Joe,<br>'Joe! You come back 'ere this minute! You'll catch it!' Joe was<br>a hefty boy with a big, lumpy sort of head and tremendous calves,<br>the kind of boy who's always doing something dangerous. At seven<br>he'd already got into short trousers, with the thick black<br>stockings drawn up over the knee and the great clumping boots that<br>boys had to wear in those days. I was still in frocks--a kind of<br>holland overall that Mother used to make for me. Katie used to<br>wear a dreadful ragged parody of a grown-up dress that descended<br>from sister to sister in her family. She had a ridiculous great<br>hat with her pigtails hanging down behind it, and a long, draggled<br>skirt which trailed on the ground, and button boots with the heels<br>trodden down. She was a tiny thing, not much taller than Joe, but<br>not bad at 'minding' children. In a family like that a child is<br>'minding' other children about as soon as it's weaned. At times<br>she'd try to be grown-up and ladylike, and she had a way of cutting<br>you short with a proverb, which to her mind was something<br>unanswerable. If you said 'Don't care', she'd answer immediately:<br><br><br>'Don't care was made to care,<br>Don't care was hung,<br>Don't care was put in a pot<br>And boiled till he was done.'<br><br><br>Or if you called her names it would be 'Hard words break no bones',<br>or, when you'd been boasting, 'Pride comes before a fall'. This<br>came very true one day when I was strutting along pretending to be<br>a soldier and fell into a cowpat. Her family lived in a filthy<br>little rat-hole of a place in the slummy street behind the brewery.<br>The place swarmed with children like a kind of vermin. The whole<br>family had managed to dodge going to school, which was fairly easy<br>to do in those days, and started running errands and doing other<br>odd jobs as soon as they could walk. One of the elder brothers got<br>a month for stealing turnips. She stopped taking us out for walks<br>a year later when Joe was eight and getting too tough for a girl to<br>handle. He'd discovered that in Katie's home they slept five in a<br>bed, and used to tease the life out of her about it.<br><br>Poor Katie! She had her first baby when she was fifteen. No one<br>knew who was the father, and probably Katie wasn't too certain<br>herself. Most people believe it was one of her brothers. The<br>workhouse people took the baby, and Katie went into service in<br>Walton. Some time afterwards she married a tinker, which even by<br>the standards of her family was a come-down. The last time I saw<br>her was in 1913. I was biking through Walton, and I passed some<br>dreadful wooden shacks beside the railway line, with fences round<br>them made out of barrel-staves, where the gypsies used to camp at<br>certain times of the year, when the police would let them. A<br>wrinkled-up hag of a woman, with her hair coming down and a smoky<br>face, looking at least fifty years old, came out of one of the huts<br>and began shaking out a rag mat. It was Katie, who must have been<br>twenty-seven. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/3.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/5.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
