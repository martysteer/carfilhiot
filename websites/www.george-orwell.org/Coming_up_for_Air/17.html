<h2>Part 4, Chapter 1</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">I came towards Lower Binfield over Chamford Hill. There are four<br>roads into Lower Binfield, and it would have been more direct to go<br>through Walton. But I'd wanted to come over Chamford Hill, the way<br>we used to go when we biked home from fishing in the Thames. When<br>you get just past the crown of the hill the trees open out and you<br>can see Lower Binfield lying in the valley below you.<br><br>It's a queer experience to go over a bit of country you haven't<br>seen in twenty years. You remember it in great detail, and you<br>remember it all wrong. All the distances are different, and the<br>landmarks seem to have moved about. You keep feeling, surely this<br>hill used to be a lot steeper--surely that turning was on the other<br>side of the road? And on the other hand you'll have memories which<br>are perfectly accurate, but which only belong to one particular<br>occasion. You'll remember, for instance, a corner of a field, on a<br>wet day in winter, with the grass so green that it's almost blue,<br>and a rotten gatepost covered with lichen and a cow standing in the<br>grass and looking at you. And you'll go back after twenty years<br>and be surprised because the cow isn't standing in the same place<br>and looking at you with the same expression.<br><br>As I drove up Chamford Hill I realized that the picture I'd had of<br>it in my mind was almost entirely imaginary. But it was a fact<br>that certain things had changed. The road was tarmac, whereas in<br>the old days it used to be macadam (I remember the bumpy feeling of<br>it under the bike), and it seemed to have got a lot wider. And<br>there were far less trees. In the old days there used to be huge<br>beeches growing in the hedgerows, and in places their boughs met<br>across the road and made a kind of arch. Now they were all gone.<br>I'd nearly got to the top of the hill when I came on something<br>which was certainly new. To the right of the road there was a<br>whole lot of fake-picturesque houses, with overhanging eaves and<br>rose pergolas and what-not. You know the kind of houses that are<br>just a little too high-class to stand in a row, and so they're<br>dotted about in a kind of colony, with private roads leading up to<br>them. And at the entrance to one of the private roads there was a<br>huge white board which said:<br><br><br>THE KENNELS<br><br>PEDIGREE SEALYHAM PUPS<br><br>DOGS BOARDED<br><br><br>Surely THAT usen't to be there?<br><br>I thought for a moment. Yes, I remembered! Where those houses<br>stood there used to be a little oak plantation, and the trees grew<br>too close together, so that they were very tall and thin, and in<br>spring the ground underneath them used to be smothered in anemones.<br>Certainly there were never any houses as far out of the town as<br>this.<br><br>I got to the top of the hill. Another minute and Lower Binfield<br>would be in sight. Lower Binfield! Why should I pretend I wasn't<br>excited? At the very thought of seeing it again an extraordinary<br>feeling that started in my guts crept upwards and did something to<br>my heart. Five seconds more and I'd be seeing it. Yes, here we<br>are! I declutched, trod on the foot-brake, and--Jesus!<br><br>Oh, yes, I know you knew what was coming. But _I_ didn't. You can<br>say I was a bloody fool not to expect it, and so I was. But it<br>hadn't even occurred to me.<br><br>The first question was, where WAS Lower Binfield?<br><br>I don't mean that it had been demolished. It had merely been<br>swallowed. The thing I was looking down at was a good-sized<br>manufacturing town. I remember--Gosh, how I remember! and in this<br>case I don't think my memory is far out--what Lower Binfield used<br>to look like from the top of Chamford Hill. I suppose the High<br>Street was about a quarter of a mile long, and except for a few<br>outlying houses the town was roughly the shape of a cross. The<br>chief landmarks were the church tower and the chimney of the<br>brewery. At this moment I couldn't distinguish either of them.<br>All I could see was an enormous river of brand-new houses which<br>flowed along the valley in both directions and half-way up the<br>hills on either side. Over to the right there were what looked<br>like several acres of bright red roofs all exactly alike. A big<br>Council housing estate, by the look of it.<br><br>But where was Lower Binfield? Where was the town I used to know?<br>It might have been anywhere. All I knew was that it was buried<br>somewhere in the middle of that sea of bricks. Of the five or six<br>factory chimneys that I could see, I couldn't even make a guess at<br>which belonged to the brewery. Towards the eastern end of the town<br>there were two enormous factories of glass and concrete. That<br>accounts for the growth of the town, I thought, as I began to take<br>it in. It occurred to me that the population of this place (it<br>used to be about two thousand in the old days) must be a good<br>twenty-five thousand. The only thing that hadn't changed,<br>seemingly, was Binfield House. It wasn't much more than a dot at<br>that distance, but you could see it on the hillside opposite, with<br>the beech trees round it, and the town hadn't climbed that high.<br>As I looked a fleet of black bombing planes came over the hill and<br>zoomed across the town.<br><br>I shoved the clutch in and started slowly down the hill. The<br>houses had climbed half-way up it. You know those very cheap small<br>houses which run up a hillside in one continuous row, with the<br>roofs rising one above the other like a flight of steps, all<br>exactly the same. But a little before I got to the houses I<br>stopped again. On the left of the road there was something else<br>that was quite new. The cemetery. I stopped opposite the lych-<br>gate to have a look at it.<br><br>It was enormous, twenty acres, I should think. There's always a<br>kind of jumped-up unhomelike look about a new cemetery, with its<br>raw gravel paths and its rough green sods, and the machine-made<br>marble angels that look like something off a wedding-cake. But<br>what chiefly struck me at the moment was that in the old days this<br>place hadn't existed. There was no separate cemetery then, only<br>the churchyard. I could vaguely remember the farmer these fields<br>used to belong to--Blackett, his name was, and he was a dairy-<br>farmer. And somehow the raw look of the place brought it home to<br>me how things have changed. It wasn't only that the town had grown<br>so vast that they needed twenty acres to dump their corpses in. It<br>was their putting the cemetery out here, on the edge of the town.<br>Have you noticed that they always do that nowadays? Every new town<br>puts its cemetery on the outskirts. Shove it away--keep it out of<br>sight! Can't bear to be reminded of death. Even the tombstones<br>tell you the same story. They never say that the chap underneath<br>them 'died', it's always 'passed away' or 'fell asleep'. It wasn't<br>so in the old days. We had our churchyard plumb in the middle of<br>the town, you passed it every day, you saw the spot where your<br>grandfather was lying and where some day you were going to lie<br>yourself. We didn't mind looking at the dead. In hot weather, I<br>admit, we also had to smell them, because some of the family vaults<br>weren't too well sealed.<br><br>I let the car run down the hill slowly. Queer! You can't imagine<br>how queer! All the way down the hill I was seeing ghosts, chiefly<br>the ghosts of hedges and trees and cows. It was as if I was<br>looking at two worlds at once, a kind of thin bubble of the thing<br>that used to be, with the thing that actually existed shining<br>through it. There's the field where the bull chased Ginger<br>Rodgers! And there's the place where the horse-mushrooms used to<br>grow! But there weren't any fields or any bulls or any mushrooms.<br>It was houses, houses everywhere, little raw red houses with their<br>grubby window-curtains and their scraps of back-garden that hadn't<br>anything in them except a patch of rank grass or a few larkspurs<br>struggling among the weeds. And blokes walking up and down, and<br>women shaking out mats, and snotty-nosed kids playing along the<br>pavement. All strangers! They'd all come crowding in while my<br>back was turned. And yet it was they who'd have looked on me as a<br>stranger, they didn't know anything about the old Lower Binfield,<br>they'd never heard of Shooter and Wetherall, or Mr Grimmett and<br>Uncle Ezekiel, and cared less, you bet.<br><br>It's funny how quickly one adjusts. I suppose it was five minutes<br>since I'd halted at the top of the hill, actually a bit out of<br>breath at the thought of seeing Lower Binfield again. And already<br>I'd got used to the idea that Lower Binfield had been swallowed up<br>and buried like the lost cities of Peru. I braced up and faced it.<br>After all, what else do you expect? Towns have got to grow, people<br>have got to live somewhere. Besides, the old town hadn't been<br>annihilated. Somewhere or other it still existed, though it had<br>houses round it instead of fields. In a few minutes I'd be seeing<br>it again, the church and the brewery chimney and Father's shop-<br>window and the horse-trough in the market-place. I got to the<br>bottom of the hill, and the road forked. I took the left-hand<br>turning, and a minute later I was lost.<br><br>I could remember nothing. I couldn't even remember whether it was<br>hereabouts that the town used to begin. All I knew was that in the<br>old days this street hadn't existed. For hundreds of yards I was<br>running along it--a rather mean, shabby kind of street, with the<br>houses giving straight on the pavement and here and there a corner<br>grocery or a dingy little pub--and wondering where the hell it led<br>to. Finally I pulled up beside a woman in a dirty apron and no hat<br>who was walking down the pavement. I stuck my head out of the<br>window.<br><br>'Beg pardon--can you tell me the way to the market-place?'<br><br>She 'couldn't tell'. Answered in an accent you could cut with a<br>spade. Lancashire. There's lots of them in the south of England<br>now. Overflow from the distressed areas. Then I saw a bloke in<br>overalls with a bag of tools coming along and tried again. This<br>time I got the answer in Cockney, but he had to think for a moment.<br><br>'Market-place? Market-place? Lessee, now. Oh--you mean the OLE<br>Market?'<br><br>I supposed I did mean the Old Market.<br><br>'Oh, well--you take the right 'and turning--'<br><br>It was a long way. Miles, it seemed to me, though really it wasn't<br>a mile. Houses, shops, cinemas, chapels, football grounds--new,<br>all new. Again I had that feeling of a kind of enemy invasion<br>having happened behind my back. All these people flooding in from<br>Lancashire and the London suburbs, planting themselves down in this<br>beastly chaos, not even bothering to know the chief landmarks of<br>the town by name. But I grasped presently why what we used to call<br>the market-place was now known as the Old Market. There was a big<br>square, though you couldn't properly call it a square, because it<br>was no particular shape, in the middle of the new town, with<br>traffic-lights and a huge bronze statue of a lion worrying an<br>eagle--the war-memorial, I suppose. And the newness of everything!<br>The raw, mean look! Do you know the look of these new towns that<br>have suddenly swelled up like balloons in the last few years,<br>Hayes, Slough, Dagenham, and so forth? The kind of chilliness, the<br>bright red brick everywhere, the temporary-looking shop-windows<br>full of cut-price chocolates and radio parts. It was just like<br>that. But suddenly I swung into a street with older houses. Gosh!<br>The High Street!<br><br>After all my memory hadn't played tricks on me. I knew every inch<br>of it now. Another couple of hundred yards and I'd be in the<br>market-place. The old shop was down the other end of the High<br>Street. I'd go there after lunch--I was going to put up at the<br>George. And every inch a memory! I knew all the shops, though all<br>the names had changed, and the stuff they dealt in had mostly<br>changed as well. There's Lovegrove's! And there's Todd's! And a<br>big dark shop with beams and dormer windows. Used to be Lilywhite's<br>the draper's, where Elsie used to work. And Grimmett's! Still a<br>grocer's apparently. Now for the horse-trough in the market-place.<br>There was another car ahead of me and I couldn't see.<br><br>It turned aside as we got into the market-place. The horse-trough<br>was gone.<br><br>There was an A.A. man on traffic-duty where it used to stand. He<br>gave a glance at the car, saw that it hadn't the A.A. sign, and<br>decided not to salute.<br><br>I turned the corner and ran down to the George. The horse-trough<br>being gone had thrown me out to such an extent that I hadn't even<br>looked to see whether the brewery chimney was still standing. The<br>George had altered too, all except the name. The front had been<br>dolled up till it looked like one of those riverside hotels, and<br>the sign was different. It was curious that although till that<br>moment I hadn't thought of it once in twenty years, I suddenly<br>found that I could remember every detail of the old sign, which had<br>swung there ever since I could remember. It was a crude kind of<br>picture, with St George on a very thin horse trampling on a very<br>fat dragon, and in the corner, though it was cracked and faded,<br>you could read the little signature, 'Wm. Sandford, Painter &<br>Carpenter'. The new sign was kind of artistic-looking. You could<br>see it had been painted by a real artist. St George looked a<br>regular pansy. The cobbled yard, where the farmers' traps used to<br>stand and the drunks used to puke on Saturday nights, had been<br>enlarged to about three times its size and concreted over, with<br>garages all round it. I backed the car into one of the garages and<br>got out.<br><br>One thing I've noticed about the human mind is that it goes in<br>jerks. There's no emotion that stays by you for any length of<br>time. During the last quarter of an hour I'd had what you could<br>fairly describe as a shock. I'd felt it almost like a sock in the<br>guts when I stopped at the top of Chamford Hill and suddenly<br>realized that Lower Binfield had vanished, and there'd been another<br>little stab when I saw the horse-trough was gone. I'd driven<br>through the streets with a gloomy, Ichabod kind of feeling. But as<br>I stepped out of the car and hitched my trilby hat on to my head I<br>suddenly felt that it didn't matter a damn. It was such a lovely<br>sunny day, and the hotel yard had a kind of summery look, with its<br>flowers in green tubs and what-not. Besides, I was hungry and<br>looking forward to a spot of lunch.<br><br>I strolled into the hotel with a consequential kind of air, with<br>the boots, who'd already nipped out to meet me, following with the<br>suitcase. I felt pretty prosperous, and probably I looked it. A<br>solid business man, you'd have said, at any rate if you hadn't seen<br>the car. I was glad I'd come in my new suit--blue flannel with a<br>thin white stripe, which suits my style. It has what the tailor<br>calls a 'reducing effect'. I believe that day I could have passed<br>for a stockbroker. And say what you like it's a very pleasant<br>thing, on a June day when the sun's shining on the pink geraniums<br>in the window-boxes, to walk into a nice country hotel with roast<br>lamb and mint sauce ahead of you. Not that it's any treat to me to<br>stay in hotels, Lord knows I see all too much of them--but ninety-<br>nine times out of a hundred it's those godless 'family and<br>commercial' hotels, like Rowbottom's, where I was supposed to be<br>staying at present, the kind of places where you pay five bob for<br>bed and breakfast, and the sheets are always damp and the bath taps<br>never work. The George had got so smart I wouldn't have known it.<br>In the old days it had hardly been a hotel, only a pub, though it<br>had a room or two to let and used to do a farmers' lunch (roast<br>beef and Yorkshire, suet dumpling and Stilton cheese) on market<br>days. It all seemed different except for the public bar, which I<br>got a glimpse of as I went past, and which looked the same as ever.<br>I went up a passage with a soft carpet, and hunting prints and<br>copper warming-pans and such-like junk hanging on the walls. And<br>dimly I could remember the passage as it used to be, the hollowed-<br>out flags underfoot, and the smell of plaster mixed up with the<br>smell of beer. A smart-looking young woman, with frizzed hair and<br>a black dress, who I suppose was the clerk or something, took my<br>name at the office.<br><br>'You wish for a room, sir? Certainly, sir. What name shall I put<br>down, sir?'<br><br>I paused. After all, this was my big moment. She'd be pretty sure<br>to know the name. It isn't common, and there are a lot of us in<br>the churchyard. We were one of the old Lower Binfield families,<br>the Bowlings of Lower Binfield. And though in a way it's painful<br>to be recognized, I'd been rather looking forward to it.<br><br>'Bowling,' I said very distinctly. 'Mr George Bowling.'<br><br>'Bowling, sir. B-O-A--oh! B-O-W? Yes, sir. And you are coming<br>from London, sir?'<br><br>No response. Nothing registered. She'd never heard of me. Never<br>heard of George Bowling, son of Samuel Bowling--Samuel Bowling who,<br>damn it! had had his half-pint in this same pub every Saturday for<br>over thirty years.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/16.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/18.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
