<h2>Part 2, Chapter 3</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Joe started going to Walton Grammar School two years before I did.<br>Neither us went there till we were nine. It meant a four-mile bike<br>ride morning and evening, and Mother was scared of allowing us<br>among the traffic, which by that time included a very few motor-<br>cars.<br><br>For several years we went to the dame-school kept by old Mrs<br>Howlett. Most of the shopkeepers' children went there, to save<br>them from the shame and come-down of going to the board school,<br>though everyone knew that Mother Howlett was an old imposter and<br>worse than useless as a teacher. She was over seventy, she was<br>very deaf, she could hardly see through her spectacles, and all she<br>owned in the way of equipment was a cane, a blackboard, a few dog-<br>eared grammar books, and a couple of dozen smelly slates. She<br>could just manage the girls, but the boys simply laughed at her and<br>played truant as often as they felt like it. Once there was a<br>frightful scandal cause a boy put his hand up a girl's dress, a<br>thing I didn't understand at the time. Mother Howlett succeeded in<br>hushing it up. When you did something particularly bad her formula<br>was 'I'll tell your father', and on very rare occasions she did so.<br>But we were quite sharp enough to see that she daren't do it too<br>often, and even when she let out at you with the cane she was so<br>old and clumsy that it was easy to dodge.<br><br>Joe was only eight when he got in with a tough gang of boys who<br>called themselves the Black Hand. The leader was Sid Lovegrove,<br>the saddler's younger son, who was about thirteen, and there were<br>two other shopkeepers' sons, an errand boy from the brewery, and<br>two farm lads who sometimes managed to cut work and go off with<br>the gang for a couple of hours. The farm lads were great lumps<br>bursting out of corduroy breeches, with very broad accents and<br>rather looked down on by the rest of the gang, but they were<br>tolerated because they knew twice as much about animals as any of<br>the others. One of them, nicknamed Ginger, would even catch a<br>rabbit in his hands occasionally. If he saw one lying in the grass<br>he used to fling himself on it like a spread-eagle. There was a<br>big social distinction between the shopkeepers' sons and the sons<br>of labourers and farm-hands, but the local boys didn't usually pay<br>much attention to it till they were about sixteen. The gang had a<br>secret password and an 'ordeal' which included cutting your finger<br>and eating an earthworm, and they gave themselves out to be<br>frightful desperadoes. Certainly they managed to make a nuisance<br>of themselves, broke windows chased cows, tore the knockers off<br>doors, and stole fruit by the hundredweight. Sometimes in winter<br>they managed to borrow a couple of ferrets and go ratting, when the<br>farmers would let them. They all had catapults and squailers, and<br>they were always saving up to buy a saloon pistol, which in those<br>days cost five shillings, but the savings never amounted to more<br>than about threepence. In summer they used to go fishing and bird-<br>nesting. When Joe was at Mrs Howlett's he used to cut school at<br>least once a week, and even at the Grammar School he managed it<br>about once a fortnight. There was a boy at the Grammar School, an<br>auctioneer's son, who could copy any handwriting and for a penny<br>he'd forge a letter from your mother saying you'd been ill<br>yesterday. Of course I was wild to join the Black Hand, but Joe<br>always choked me off and said they didn't want any blasted kids<br>hanging round.<br><br>It was the thought of going fishing that really appealed to me. At<br>eight years old I hadn't yet been fishing, except with a penny net,<br>with which you can sometimes catch a stickleback. Mother was<br>always terrified of letting us go anywhere near water. She<br>'forbade' fishing, in the way in which parents in those days<br>'forbade' almost everything, and I hadn't yet grasped that grownups<br>can't see round corners. But the thought of fishing sent me wild<br>with excitement. Many a time I'd been past the pool at the Mill<br>Farm and watched the small carp basking on the surface, and<br>sometimes under the willow tree at the corner a great diamond-<br>shaped carp that to my eyes looked enormous--six inches long, I<br>suppose--would suddenly rise to the surface, gulp down a grub, and<br>sink again. I'd spent hours gluing my nose against the window of<br>Wallace's in the High Street, where fishing tackle and guns and<br>bicycles were sold. I used to lie awake on summer mornings<br>thinking of the tales Joe had told me about fishing, how you mixed<br>bread paste, how your float gives a bob and plunges under and you<br>feel the rod bending and the fish tugging at the line. Is it any<br>use talking about it, I wonder--the sort of fairy light that fish<br>and fishing tackle have in a kid's eyes? Some kids feel the same<br>about guns and shooting, some feel it about motor-bikes or<br>aeroplanes or horses. It's not a thing that you can explain or<br>rationalize, it's merely magic. One morning--it was in June and I<br>must have been eight--I knew that Joe was going to cut school and<br>go out fishing, and I made up my mind to follow. In some way Joe<br>guessed what I was thinking about, and he started on me while we<br>were dressing.<br><br>'Now then, young George! Don't you get thinking you're coming with<br>the gang today. You stay back home.'<br><br>'No, I didn't. I didn't think nothing about it.'<br><br>'Yes, you did! You thought you were coming with the gang.'<br><br>'No, I didn't!'<br><br>'Yes, you did!'<br><br>'No, I didn't!'<br><br>'Yes, you did! You stay back home. We don't want any bloody kids<br>along.'<br><br>Joe had just learned the word 'bloody' and was always using it.<br>Father overheard him once and swore that he'd thrash the life out<br>of Joe, but as usual he didn't do so. After breakfast Joe started<br>off on his bike, with his satchel and his Grammar School cap, five<br>minutes early as he always did when he meant to cut school, and<br>when it was time for me to leave for Mother Howlett's I sneaked off<br>and hid in the lane behind the allotments. I knew the gang were<br>going to the pond at the Mill Farm, and I was going to follow them<br>if they murdered me for it. Probably they'd give me a hiding, and<br>probably I wouldn't get home to dinner, and then Mother would know<br>that I'd cut school and I'd get another hiding, but I didn't care.<br>I was just desperate to go fishing with the gang. I was cunning,<br>too. I allowed Joe plenty of time to make a circuit round and get<br>to the Mill Farm by road, and then I followed down the lane and<br>skirted round the meadows on the far side of the hedge, so as to<br>get almost to the pond before the gang saw me. It was a wonderful<br>June morning. The buttercups were up to my knees. There was a<br>breath of wind just stirring the tops of the elms, and the great<br>green clouds of leaves were sort of soft and rich like silk. And<br>it was nine in the morning and I was eight years old, and all round<br>me it was early summer, with great tangled hedges where the wild<br>roses were still in bloom, and bits of soft white cloud drifting<br>overhead, and in the distance the low hills and the dim blue masses<br>of the woods round Upper Binfield. And I didn't give a damn for<br>any of it. All I was thinking of was the green pool and the carp<br>and the gang with their hooks and lines and bread paste. It was as<br>though they were in paradise and I'd got to join them. Presently I<br>managed to sneak up on them--four of them, Joe and Sid Lovegrove<br>and the errand boy and another shopkeeper's son, Harry Barnes I<br>think his name was.<br><br>Joe turned and saw me. 'Christ!' he said. 'It's the kid.' He<br>walked up to me like a tom-cat that's going to start a fight. 'Now<br>then, you! What'd I tell you? You get back 'ome double quick.'<br><br>Both Joe and I were inclined to drop our aitches if we were at all<br>excited. I backed away from him.<br><br>'I'm not going back 'ome.'<br><br>'Yes you are.'<br><br>'Clip his ear, Joe,' said Sid. 'We don't want no kids along.'<br><br>'ARE you going back 'ome?' said Joe.<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'Righto, my boy! Right-HO!'<br><br>Then he started on me. The next minute he was chasing me round,<br>catching me one clip after another. But I didn't run away from the<br>pool, I ran in circles. Presently he'd caught me and got me down,<br>and then he knelt on my upper arms and began screwing my ears,<br>which was his favourite torture and one I couldn't stand. I was<br>blubbing by this time, but still I wouldn't give in and promise to<br>go home. I wanted to stay and go fishing with the gang. And<br>suddenly the others swung round in my favour and told Joe to get up<br>off my chest and let me stay if I wanted to. So I stayed after<br>all.<br><br>The others had some hooks and lines and floats and a lump of bread<br>paste in a rag, and we all cut ourselves willow switches from the<br>tree at the corner of the pool. The farmhouse was only about two<br>hundred yards away, and you had to keep out of sight because old<br>Brewer was very down on fishing. Not that it made any difference<br>to him, he only used the pool for watering his cattle, but he hated<br>boys. The others were still jealous of me and kept telling me to<br>get out of the light and reminding me that I was only a kid and<br>knew nothing about fishing. They said that I was making such a<br>noise I'd scare all the fish away, though actually I was making<br>about half as much noise as anyone else there. Finally they<br>wouldn't let me sit beside them and sent me to another part of the<br>pool where the water was shallower and there wasn't so much shade.<br>They said a kid like me was sure to keep splashing the water and<br>frighten the fish away. It was a rotten part of the pool, a part<br>where no fish would ordinarily come. I knew that. I seemed to<br>know by a kind of instinct the places where a fish would lie.<br>Still, I was fishing at last. I was sitting on the grass bank with<br>the rod in my hands, with the flies buzzing round, and the smell of<br>wild peppermint fit to knock you down, watching the red float on<br>the green water, and I was happy as a tinker although the tear-<br>marks mixed up with dirt were still all over my face.<br><br>Lord knows how long we sat there. The morning stretched out and<br>out, and the sun got higher and higher, and nobody had a bite. It<br>was a hot still day, too clear for fishing. The floats lay on the<br>water with never a quiver. You could see deep down into the water<br>as though you were looking into a kind of dark green glass. Out in<br>the middle of the pool you could see the fish lying just under the<br>surface, sunning themselves, and sometimes in the weeds near the<br>side a newt would come gliding upwards and rest there with his<br>fingers on the weeds and his nose just out of the water. But the<br>fish weren't biting. The others kept shouting that they'd got a<br>nibble, but it was always a lie. And the time stretched out and<br>out and it got hotter and hotter, and the flies ate you alive, and<br>the wild peppermint under the bank smelt like Mother Wheeler's<br>sweet-shop. I was getting hungrier and hungrier, all the more<br>because I didn't know for certain where my dinner was coming from.<br>But I sat as still as a mouse and never took my eyes off the float.<br>The others had given me a lump of bait about the size of a marble,<br>telling me that would have to do for me, but for a long time I<br>didn't even dare to re-bait my hook, because every time I pulled my<br>line up they swore I was making enough noise to frighten every fish<br>within five miles.<br><br>I suppose we must have been there about two hours when suddenly my<br>float gave a quiver. I knew it was a fish. It must have been a<br>fish that was just passing accidentally and saw my bait. There's<br>no mistaking the movement your float gives when it's a real bite.<br>It's quite different from the way it moves when you twitch your<br>line accidentally. The next moment it gave a sharp bob and almost<br>went under. I couldn't hold myself in any longer. I yelled to the<br>others:<br><br>'I've got a bite!'<br><br>'Rats!' yelled Sid Lovegrove instantly.<br><br>But the next moment there wasn't any doubt about it. The float<br>dived straight down, I could still see it under the water, kind of<br>dim red, and I felt the rod tighten in my hand. Christ, that<br>feeling! The line jerking and straining and a fish on the other<br>end of it! The others saw my rod bending, and the next moment<br>they'd all flung their rods down and rushed round to me. I gave a<br>terrific haul and the fish--a great huge silvery fish--came flying<br>up through the air. The same moment all of us gave a yell of<br>agony. The fish had slipped off the hook and fallen into the wild<br>peppermint under the bank. But he'd fallen into shallow water<br>where he couldn't turn over, and for perhaps a second he lay there<br>on his side helpless. Joe flung himself into the water, splashing<br>us all over, and grabbed him in both hands. 'I got 'im!' he<br>yelled. The next moment he'd flung the fish on to the grass and we<br>were all kneeling round it. How we gloated! The poor dying brute<br>flapped up and down and his scales glistened all the colours of the<br>rainbow. It was a huge carp, seven inches long at least, and must<br>have weighed a quarter of a pound. How we shouted to see him! But<br>the next moment it was as though a shadow had fallen across us. We<br>looked up, and there was old Brewer standing over us, with his tall<br>billycock hat--one of those hats they used to wear that were a<br>cross between a top hat and a bowler--and his cowhide gaiters and a<br>thick hazel stick in his hand.<br><br>We suddenly cowered like partridges when there's a hawk overhead.<br>He looked from one to other of us. He had a wicked old mouth with<br>no teeth in it, and since he'd shaved his beard off his chin looked<br>like a nutcracker.<br><br>'What are you boys doing here?' he said.<br><br>There wasn't much doubt about what we were doing. Nobody answered.<br><br>'I'll learn 'ee come fishing in my pool!' he suddenly roared, and<br>the next moment he was on us, whacking out in all directions.<br><br>The Black Hand broke and fled. We left all the rods behind and<br>also the fish. Old Brewer chased us half across the meadow. His<br>legs were stiff and he couldn't move fast, but he got in some good<br>swipes before we were out of his reach. We left him in the middle<br>of the field, yelling after us that he knew all our names and was<br>going to tell our fathers. I'd been at the back and most of the<br>wallops had landed on me. I had some nasty red weals on the calves<br>of my legs when we got to the other side of the hedge.<br><br>I spent the rest of the day with the gang. They hadn't made up<br>their mind whether I was really a member yet, but for the time<br>being they tolerated me. The errand boy, who'd had the morning off<br>on some lying pretext or other, had to go back to the brewery. The<br>rest of us went for a long, meandering, scrounging kind of walk,<br>the sort of walk that boys go for when they're away from home all<br>day, and especially when they're away without permission. It was<br>the first real boy's walk I'd had, quite different from the walks<br>we used to go with Katie Simmons. We had our dinner in a dry ditch<br>on the edge of the town, full of rusty cans and wild fennel. The<br>others gave me bits of their dinner, and Sid Lovegrove had a penny,<br>so someone fetched a Penny Monster which we had between us. It was<br>very hot, and the fennel smelt very strong, and the gas of the<br>Penny Monster made us belch. Afterwards we wandered up the dusty<br>white road to Upper Binfield, the first time I'd been that way, I<br>believe, and into the beech woods with the carpets of dead leaves<br>and the great smooth trunks that soar up into the sky so that the<br>birds in the upper branches look like dots. You could go wherever<br>you liked in the woods in those days. Binfield House, was shut up,<br>they didn't preserve the pheasants any longer, and at the worst<br>you'd only meet a carter with a load of wood. There was a tree<br>that had been sawn down, and the rings of the trunk looked like a<br>target, and we had shots at it with stones. Then the others had<br>shots at birds with their catapults, and Sid Lovegrove swore he'd<br>hit a chaffinch and it had stuck in a fork in the tree. Joe said<br>he was lying, and they argued and almost fought. Then we went down<br>into a chalk hollow full of beds of dead leaves and shouted to hear<br>the echo. Someone shouted a dirty word, and then we said over all<br>the dirty words we knew, and the others jeered at me because I only<br>knew three. Sid Lovegrove said he knew how babies were born and it<br>was just the same as rabbits except that the baby came out of the<br>woman's navel. Harry Barnes started to carve the word ---- on a<br>beech tree, but got fed up with it after the first two letters.<br>Then we went round by the lodge of Binfield House. There was a<br>rumour that somewhere in the grounds there was a pond with enormous<br>fish in it, but no one ever dared go inside because old Hodges, the<br>lodge-keeper who acted as a kind of caretaker, was 'down' on boys.<br>He was digging in his vegetable garden by the lodge when we passed.<br>We cheeked him over the fence until he chased us off, and then we<br>went down to the Walton Road and cheeked the carters, keeping on<br>the other side of the hedge so that they couldn't reach us with<br>their whips. Beside the Walton Road there was a place that had<br>been a quarry and then a rubbish dump, and finally had got<br>overgrown with blackberry bushes. There were great mounds of rusty<br>old tin cans and bicycle frames and saucepans with holes in them<br>and broken bottles with weeds growing all over them, and we spent<br>nearly an hour and got ourselves filthy from head to foot routing<br>out iron fence posts, because Harry Barnes swore that the<br>blacksmith in Lower Binfield would pay sixpence a hundredweight for<br>old iron. Then Joe found a late thrush's nest with half-fledged<br>chicks in it in a blackberry bush. After a lot of argument about<br>what to do with them we took the chicks out, had shots at them with<br>stones, and finally stamped on them. There were four of them, and<br>we each had one to stamp on. It was getting on towards tea-time<br>now. We knew that old Brewer would be as good as his word and<br>there was a hiding ahead of us, but we were getting too hungry to<br>stay out much longer. Finally we trailed home, with one more row<br>on the way, because when we were passing the allotments we saw a<br>rat and chased it with sticks, and old Bennet the station-master,<br>who worked at his allotment every night and was very proud of it,<br>came after us in a tearing rage because we'd trampled on his onion-<br>bed.<br><br>I'd walked ten miles and I wasn't tired. All day I'd trailed after<br>the gang and tried to do everything they did, and they'd called me<br>'the kid' and snubbed me as much as they could, but I'd more or<br>less kept my end up. I had a wonderful feeling inside me, a<br>feeling you can't know about unless you've had it--but if you're a<br>man you'll have had it some time. I knew that I wasn't a kid any<br>longer, I was a boy at last. And it's a wonderful thing to be a<br>boy, to go roaming where grown-ups can't catch you, and to chase<br>rats and kill birds and shy stones and cheek carters and shout<br>dirty words. It's a kind of strong, rank feeling, a feeling of<br>knowing everything and fearing nothing, and it's all bound up with<br>breaking rules and killing things. The white dusty roads, the hot<br>sweaty feeling of one's clothes, the smell of fennel and wild<br>peppermint, the dirty words, the sour stink of the rubbish dump,<br>the taste of fizzy lemonade and the gas that made one belch, the<br>stamping on the young birds, the feel of the fish straining on the<br>line--it was all part of it. Thank God I'm a man, because no woman<br>ever has that feeling.<br><br>Sure enough, old Brewer had sent round and told everybody. Father<br>looked very glum, fetched a strap out of the shop, and said he was<br>going to 'thrash the life out of' Joe. But Joe struggled and<br>yelled and kicked, and in the end Father didn't get in more than a<br>couple of whacks at him. However, he got a caning from the<br>headmaster of the Grammar School next day. I tried to struggle<br>too, but I was small enough for Mother to get me across her knee,<br>and she gave me what-for with the strap. So I'd had three hidings<br>that day, one from Joe, one from old Brewer, and one from Mother.<br>Next day the gang decided that I wasn't really a member yet and<br>that I'd got to go through the 'ordeal' (a word they'd got out of<br>the Red Indian stories) after all. They were very strict in<br>insisting that you had to bite the worm before you swallowed it.<br>Moreover, because I was the youngest and they were jealous of me<br>for being the only one to catch anything, they all made out<br>afterwards that the fish I'd caught wasn't really a big one. In a<br>general way the tendency of fish, when people talk about them, is<br>to get bigger and bigger, but this one got smaller and smaller,<br>until to hear the others talk you'd have thought it was no bigger<br>than a minnow.<br><br>But it didn't matter. I'd been fishing. I'd seen the float dive<br>under the water and felt the fish tugging at the line, and however<br>many lies they told they couldn't take that away from me. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/5.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/7.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
