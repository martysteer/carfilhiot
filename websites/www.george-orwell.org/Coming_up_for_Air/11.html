<h2>Part 2, Chapter 8</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">I wasn't wounded till late in 1916.<br><br>We'd just come out of the trenches and were marching over a bit of<br>road a mile or so back which was supposed to be safe, but which the<br>Germans must have got the range of some time earlier. Suddenly<br>they started putting a few shells over--it was heavy H.E. stuff,<br>and they were only firing about one a minute. There was the usual<br>zwee-e-e-e! and then BOOM! in a field somewhere over to the right.<br>I think it was the third shell that got me. I knew as soon as I<br>heard it coming that it had my name written on it. They say you<br>always know. It didn't say what an ordinary shell says. It said<br>'I'm after you, you b--, YOU, you b--, YOU!'--all this in the space<br>of about three seconds. And the last you was the explosion.<br><br>I felt as if an enormous hand made of air were sweeping me along.<br>And presently I came down with a sort of burst, shattered feeling<br>among a lot of old tin cans, splinters of wood, rusty barbed wire,<br>turds, empty cartridge cases, and other muck in the ditch at the<br>side of the road. When they'd hauled me out and cleaned some of<br>the dirt off me they found that I wasn't very badly hurt. It was<br>only a lot of small shell-splinters that had lodged in one side of<br>my bottom and down the backs of my legs. But luckily I'd broken a<br>rib in falling, which made it just bad enough to get me back to<br>England. I spent that winter in a hospital camp on the downs near<br>Eastbourne.<br><br>Do you remember those war-time hospital camps? The long rows of<br>wooden huts like chicken-houses stuck right on top of those beastly<br>icy downs--the 'south coast', people used to call it, which made me<br>wonder what the north coast could be like--where the wind seems to<br>blow at you from all directions at once. And the droves of blokes<br>in their pale-blue flannel suits and red ties, wandering up and<br>down looking for a place out of the wind and never finding one.<br>Sometimes the kids from the slap-up boys' schools in Eastbourne<br>used to be led round in crocodiles to hand out fags and peppermint<br>creams to the 'wounded Tommies', as they called us. A pink-faced<br>kid of about eight would walk up to a knot of wounded men sitting<br>on the grass, split open a packet of Woodbines and solemnly hand<br>one fag to each man, just like feeding the monkeys at the zoo.<br>Anyone who was strong enough used to wander for miles over the<br>downs in hopes of meeting girls. There were never enough girls to<br>go round. In the valley below the camp there was a bit of a<br>spinney, and long before dusk you'd see a couple glued against<br>every tree, and sometimes, if it happened to be a thick tree, one<br>on each side of it. My chief memory of that time is sitting<br>against a gorse-bush in the freezing wind, with my fingers so cold<br>I couldn't bend them and the taste of a peppermint cream in my<br>mouth. That's a typical soldier's memory. But I was getting away<br>from a Tommy's life, all the same. The C.O. had sent my name in<br>for a commission a little before I was wounded. By this time they<br>were desperate for officers and anyone who wasn't actually<br>illiterate could have a commission if he wanted one. I went<br>straight from the hospital to an officers' training camp near<br>Colchester.<br><br>It's very strange, the things the war did to people. It was less<br>than three years since I'd been a spry young shop-assistant,<br>bending over the counter in my white apron with 'Yes, madam!<br>Certainly, madam! AND the next order, madam?' with a grocer's life<br>ahead of me and about as much notion of becoming an Army officer as<br>of getting a knighthood. And here I was already, swaggering about<br>in a gorblimey hat and a yellow collar and more or less keeping my<br>end up among a crowd of other temporary gents and some who weren't<br>even temporary. And--this is really the point--not feeling it in<br>any way strange. Nothing seemed strange in those days.<br><br>It was like an enormous machine that had got hold of you. You'd no<br>sense of acting of your own free will, and at the same time no<br>notion of trying to resist. If people didn't have some such<br>feeling as that, no war could last three months. The armies would<br>just pack up and go home. Why had I joined the Army? Or the<br>million other idiots who joined up before conscription came in?<br>Partly for a lark and partly because of England my England and<br>Britons never never and all that stuff. But how long did that<br>last? Most of the chaps I knew had forgotten all about it long<br>before they got as far as France. The men in the trenches weren't<br>patriotic, didn't hate the Kaiser, didn't care a damn about gallant<br>little Belgium and the Germans raping nuns on tables (it was always<br>'on tables', as though that made it worse) in the streets of<br>Brussels. On the other hand it didn't occur to them to try and<br>escape. The machine had got hold of you and it could do what it<br>liked with you. It lifted you up and dumped you down among places<br>and things you'd never dreamed of, and if it had dumped you down on<br>the surface of the moon it wouldn't have seemed particularly<br>strange. The day I joined the Army the old life was finished. It<br>was as though it didn't concern me any longer. I wonder if you'd<br>believe that from that day forward I only once went back to Lower<br>Binfield, and that was to Mother's funeral? It sounds incredible<br>now, but it seemed natural enough at the time. Partly, I admit, it<br>was on account of Elsie, whom, of course, I'd stopped writing to<br>after two or three months. No doubt she'd picked up with someone<br>else, but I didn't want to meet her. Otherwise, perhaps, when I<br>got a bit of leave I'd have gone down and seen Mother, who'd had<br>fits when I joined the Army but would have been proud of a son in<br>uniform.<br><br>Father died in 1915. I was in France at the time. I don't<br>exaggerate when I say that Father's death hurts me more now than<br>it did then. At the time it was just a bit of bad news which I<br>accepted almost without interest, in the sort of empty-headed<br>apathetic way in which one accepted everything in the trenches.<br>I remember crawling into the doorway of the dugout to get enough<br>light to read the letter, and I remember Mother's tear-stains on<br>the letter, and the aching feeling in my knees and the smell of<br>mud. Father's life-insurance policy had been mortgaged for most of<br>its value, but there was a little money in the bank and Sarazins'<br>were going to buy up the stock and even pay some tiny amount for<br>the good-will. Anyway, Mother had a bit over two hundred pounds,<br>besides the furniture. She went for the time being to lodge with<br>her cousin, the wife of a small-holder who was doing pretty well<br>out of the war, near Doxley, a few miles the other side of Walton.<br>It was only 'for the time being'. There was a temporary feeling<br>about everything. In the old days, which as a matter of fact were<br>barely a year old, the whole thing would have been an appalling<br>disaster. With Father dead, the shop sold and Mother with two<br>hundred pounds in the world, you'd have seen stretching out in<br>front of you a kind of fifteen-act tragedy, the last act being a<br>pauper's funeral. But now the war and the feeling of not being<br>one's own master overshadowed everything. People hardly thought in<br>terms of things like bankruptcy and the workhouse any longer. This<br>was the case even with Mother, who, God knows, had only very dim<br>notions about the war. Besides, she was already dying, though<br>neither of us knew it.<br><br>She came across to see me in the hospital at Eastbourne. It was<br>over two years since I'd seen her, and her appearance gave me a bit<br>of a shock. She seemed to have faded and somehow to have shrunken.<br>Partly it was because by this time I was grown-up, I'd travelled,<br>and everything looked smaller to me, but there was no question that<br>she'd got thinner, and also yellower. She talked in the old<br>rambling way about Aunt Martha (that was the cousin she was staying<br>with), and the changes in Lower Binfield since the war, and all the<br>boys who'd 'gone' (meaning joined the Army), and her indigestion<br>which was 'aggravating', and poor Father's tombstone and what a<br>lovely corpse he made. It was the old talk, the talk I'd listened<br>to for years, and yet somehow it was like a ghost talking. It<br>didn't concern me any longer. I'd known her as a great splendid<br>protecting kind of creature, a bit like a ship's figure-head and a<br>bit like a broody hen, and after all she was only a little old<br>woman in a black dress. Everything was changing and fading. That<br>was the last time I saw her alive. I got the wire saying she was<br>seriously ill when I was at the training school at Colchester, and<br>put in for a week's urgent leave immediately. But it was too late.<br>She was dead by the time I got to Doxley. What she and everyone<br>else had imagined to be indigestion was some kind of internal<br>growth, and a sudden chill on the stomach put the final touch.<br>The doctor tried to cheer me up by telling me that the growth was<br>'benevolent', which struck me as a queer thing to call it, seeing<br>that it had killed her.<br><br>Well, we buried her next to Father, and that was my last glimpse of<br>Lower Binfield. It had changed a lot, even in three years. Some<br>of the shops were shut, some had different names over them. Nearly<br>all the men I'd known as boys were gone, and some of them were<br>dead. Sid Lovegrove was dead, killed on the Somme. Ginger Watson,<br>the farm lad who'd belonged to the Black Hand years ago, the one<br>who used to catch rabbits alive, was dead in Egypt. One of the<br>chaps who'd worked with me at Grimmett's had lost both legs. Old<br>Lovegrove had shut up his shop and was living in a cottage near<br>Walton on a tiny annuity. Old Grimmett, on the other hand, was<br>doing well out of the war and had turned patriotic and was a member<br>of the local board which tried conscientious objectors. The thing<br>which more than anything else gave the town an empty, forlorn kind<br>of look was that there were practically no horses left. Every<br>horse worth taking had been commandeered long ago. The station fly<br>still existed, but the brute that pulled it wouldn't have been able<br>to stand up if it hadn't been for the shafts. For the hour or so<br>that I was there before the funeral I wandered round the town,<br>saying how d'you do to people and showing off my uniform. Luckily<br>I didn't run into Elsie. I saw all the changes, and yet it was as<br>though I didn't see them. My mind was on other things, chiefly the<br>pleasure of being seen in my second-loot's uniform, with my black<br>armlet (a thing which looks rather smart on khaki) and my new<br>whipcord breeches. I distinctly remember that I was still thinking<br>about those whipcord breeches when we stood at the graveside. And<br>then they chucked some earth on to the coffin and I suddenly<br>realized what it means for your mother to be lying with seven feet<br>of earth on top of her, and something kind of twitched behind my<br>eyes and nose, but even then the whipcord breeches weren't<br>altogether out of my mind.<br><br>Don't think I didn't feel for Mother's death. I did. I wasn't in<br>the trenches any longer, I could feel sorry for a death. But the<br>thing I didn't care a damn about, didn't even grasp to be<br>happening, was the passing-away of the old life I'd known. After<br>the funeral, Aunt Martha, who was rather proud of having a 'real<br>officer' for a nephew and would have made a splash of the funeral<br>if I'd let her, went back to Doxley on the bus and I took the fly<br>down to the station, to get the train to London and then to<br>Colchester. We drove past the shop. No one had taken it since<br>Father died. It was shut up and the window-pane was black with<br>dust, and they'd burned the 'S. Bowling' off the signboard with a<br>plumber's blowflame. Well, there was the house where I'd been a<br>child and a boy and a young man, where I'd crawled about the<br>kitchen floor and smelt the sainfoin and read 'Donovan the<br>Dauntless', where I'd done my homework for the Grammar School,<br>mixed bread paste, mended bicycle punctures, and tried on my first<br>high collar. It had been as permanent to me as the Pyramids, and<br>now it would be just an accident if I ever set foot in it again.<br>Father, Mother, Joe, the errand boys, old Nailer the terrier, Spot,<br>the one that came after Nailer, Jackie the bullfinch, the cats, the<br>mice in the loft--all gone, nothing left but dust. And I didn't<br>care a damn. I was sorry Mother was dead, I was even sorry Father<br>was dead, but all the time my mind was on other things. I was a<br>bit proud of being seen riding in a cab, a thing I hadn't yet got<br>used to, and I was thinking of the sit of my new whipcord breeches,<br>and my nice smooth officer's putties, so different from the gritty<br>stuff the Tommies had to wear, and of the other chaps at Colchester<br>and the sixty quid Mother had left and the beanos we'd have with<br>it. Also I was thanking God that I hadn't happened to run into<br>Elsie.<br><br>The war did extraordinary things to people. And what was more<br>extraordinary than the way it killed people was the way it<br>sometimes didn't kill them. It was like a great flood rushing you<br>along to death, and suddenly it would shoot you up some backwater<br>where you'd find yourself doing incredible and pointless things and<br>drawing extra pay for them. There were labour battalions making<br>roads across the desert that didn't lead anywhere, there were chaps<br>marooned on oceanic islands to look out for German cruisers which<br>had been sunk years earlier, there were Ministries of this and that<br>with armies of clerks and typists which went on existing years<br>after their function had ended, by a kind of inertia. People were<br>shoved into meaningless jobs and then forgotten by the authorities<br>for years on end. This was what happened to myself, or very likely<br>I wouldn't be here. The whole sequence of events is rather<br>interesting.<br><br>A little while after I was gazetted there was a call for officers<br>of the A.S.C. As soon as the O.C. of the training camp heard that<br>I knew something about the grocery trade (I didn't let on that I'd<br>actually been behind the counter) he told me to send my name in.<br>That went through all right, and I was just about to leave for<br>another training-school for A.S.C. officers somewhere in the<br>Midlands when there was a demand for a young officer, with<br>knowledge of the grocery trade, to act as some kind of secretary to<br>Sir Joseph Cheam, who was a big noise in the A.S.C. God knows why<br>they picked me out, but at any rate they did so. I've since<br>thought that they probably mixed my name up with somebody else's.<br>Three days later I was saluting in Sir Joseph's office. He was a<br>lean, upright, rather handsome old boy with grizzled hair and a<br>grave-looking nose which immediately impressed me. He looked the<br>perfect professional soldier, the K.C.M.G., D.S.O. with bar type,<br>and might have been twin brother to the chap in the De Reszke<br>advert, though in private life he was chairman of one of the big<br>chain groceries and famous all over the world for something called<br>the Cheam Wage-Cut System. He stopped writing as I came in and<br>looked me over.<br><br>'You a gentleman?'<br><br>'No, sir.'<br><br>'Good. Then perhaps we'll get some work done.'<br><br>In about three minutes he'd wormed out of me that I had no<br>secretarial experience, didn't know shorthand, couldn't use a<br>typewriter, and had worked in a grocery at twenty-eight shillings a<br>week. However, he said that I'd do, there were too many gentlemen<br>in this damned Army and he'd been looking for somebody who could<br>count beyond ten. I liked him and looked forward to working for<br>him, but just at this moment the mysterious powers that seemed to<br>be running the war drove us apart again. Something called the West<br>Coast Defence Force was being formed, or rather was being talked<br>about, and there was some vague idea of establishing dumps of<br>rations and other stores at various points along the coast. Sir<br>Joseph was supposed to be responsible for the dumps in the south-<br>west corner of England. The day after I joined his office he sent<br>me down to check over the stores at a place called Twelve Mile<br>Dump, on the North Cornish Coast. Or rather my job was to find out<br>whether any stores existed. Nobody seemed certain about this. I'd<br>just got there and discovered that the stores consisted of eleven<br>tins of bully beef when a wire arrived from the War Office telling<br>me to take charge of the stores at Twelve Mile Dump and remain<br>there till further notice. I wired back 'No stores at Twelve Mile<br>Dump.' Too late. Next day came the official letter informing me<br>that I was O.C. Twelve Mile Dump. And that's really the end of the<br>story. I remained O.C. Twelve Mile Dump for the rest of the war.<br><br>God knows what it was all about. It's no use asking me what the<br>West Coast Defence Force was or what it was supposed to do. Even<br>at that time nobody pretended to know. In any case it didn't<br>exist. It was just a scheme that had floated through somebody's<br>mind--following on some vague rumour of a German invasion via<br>Ireland, I suppose--and the food dumps which were supposed to exist<br>all along the coast were also imaginary. The whole thing had<br>existed for about three days, like a sort of bubble, and then had<br>been forgotten, and I'd been forgotten with it. My eleven tins of<br>bully beef had been left behind by some officers who had been there<br>earlier on some other mysterious mission. They'd also left behind<br>a very deaf old man called Private Lidgebird. What Lidgebird was<br>supposed to be doing there I never discovered. I wonder whether<br>you'll believe that I remained guarding those eleven tins of bully<br>beef from half-way through 1917 to the beginning of 1919? Probably<br>you won't, but it's the truth. And at the time even that didn't<br>seem particularly strange. By 1918 one had simply got out of the<br>habit of expecting things to happen in a reasonable manner.<br><br>Once a month they sent me an enormous official form calling upon me<br>to state the number and condition of pick-axes, entrenching tools,<br>coils of barbed wire, blankets, waterproof groundsheets, first-aid<br>outfits, sheets of corrugated iron, and tins of plum and apple jam<br>under my care. I just entered 'nil' against everything and sent<br>the form back. Nothing ever happened. Up in London someone was<br>quietly filing the forms, and sending out more forms, and filing<br>those, and so on. It was the way things were happening. The<br>mysterious higher-ups who were running the war had forgotten my<br>existence. I didn't jog their memory. I was up a backwater that<br>didn't lead anywhere, and after two years in France I wasn't so<br>burning with patriotism that I wanted to get out of it.<br><br>It was a lonely part of the coast where you never saw a soul except<br>a few yokels who'd barely heard there was a war on. A quarter of a<br>mile away, down a little hill, the sea boomed and surged over<br>enormous flats of sand. Nine months of the year it rained, and the<br>other three a raging wind blew off the Atlantic. There was nothing<br>there except Private Lidgebird, myself, two Army huts--one of them<br>a decentish two-roomed hut which I inhabited--and the eleven tins<br>of bully beef. Lidgebird was a surly old devil and I could never<br>get much out of him except the fact that he'd been a market<br>gardener before he joined the Army. It was interesting to see how<br>rapidly he was reverting to type. Even before I got to Twelve Mile<br>Dump he'd dug a patch round one of the huts and started planting<br>spuds, in the autumn he dug another patch till he'd got about half<br>an acre under cultivation, at the beginning of 1918 he started<br>keeping hens which had got to quite a number by the end of the<br>summer, and towards the end of the year he suddenly produced a pig<br>from God knows where. I don't think it crossed his mind to wonder<br>what the devil we were doing there, or what the West Coast Defence<br>Force was and whether it actually existed. It wouldn't surprise me<br>to hear that he's there still, raising pigs and potatoes on the<br>spot where Twelve Mile Dump used to be. I hope he is. Good luck<br>to him.<br><br>Meanwhile I was doing something I'd never before had the chance to<br>do as a full-time job--reading.<br><br>The officers who'd been there before had left a few books behind,<br>mostly sevenpenny editions and nearly all of them the kind of tripe<br>that people were reading in those days. Ian Hay and Sapper and the<br>Craig Kennedy stories and so forth. But at some time or other<br>somebody had been there who knew what books are worth reading and<br>what are not. I myself, at the time, didn't know anything of the<br>kind. The only books I'd ever voluntarily read were detective<br>stories and once in a way a smutty sex book. God knows I don't set<br>up to be a highbrow even now, but if you'd asked me THEN for the<br>name of a 'good' book I'd have answered The Woman Thou Gavest Me,<br>or (in memory of the vicar) Sesame and Lilies. In any case a<br>'good' book was a book one didn't have any intention of reading.<br>But there I was, in a job where there was less than nothing to do,<br>with the sea booming on the beach and the rain streaming down the<br>window-panes--and a whole row of books staring me in the face on<br>the temporary shelf someone had rigged up against the wall of the<br>hut. Naturally I started to read them from end to end, with, at<br>the beginning, about as much attempt to discriminate as a pig<br>working its way through a pail of garbage.<br><br>But in among them there were three or four books that were<br>different from the others. No, you've got it wrong! Don't run<br>away with the idea that I suddenly discovered Marcel Proust or<br>Henry James or somebody. I wouldn't have read them even if I had.<br>These books I'm speaking of weren't in the least highbrow. But now<br>and again it so happens that you strike a book which is exactly at<br>the mental level you've reached at the moment, so much so that it<br>seems to have been written especially for you. One of them was<br>H. G. Wells's The History of Mr Polly, in a cheap shilling edition<br>which was falling to pieces. I wonder if you can imagine the<br>effect it had upon me, to be brought up as I'd been brought up, the<br>son of a shopkeeper in a country town, and then to come across a<br>book like that? Another was Compton Mackenzie's Sinister Street.<br>It had been the scandal of the season a few years back, and I'd<br>even heard vague rumours of it in Lower Binfield. Another was<br>Conrad's Victory, parts of which bored me. But books like that<br>started you thinking. And there was a back number of some magazine<br>with a blue cover which had a short story of D. H. Lawrence's in<br>it. I don't remember the name of it. It was a story about a<br>German conscript who shoves his sergeant-major over the edge of a<br>fortification and then does a bunk and gets caught in his girl's<br>bedroom. It puzzled me a lot. I couldn't make out what it was all<br>about, and yet it left me with a vague feeling that I'd like to<br>read some others like it.<br><br>Well, for several months I had an appetite for books that was<br>almost like physical thirst. It was the first real go-in at<br>reading that I'd had since my Dick Donovan days. At the beginning<br>I had no idea how to set about getting hold of books. I thought<br>the only way was to buy them. That's interesting, I think. It<br>shows you the difference upbringing makes. I suppose the children<br>of the middle classes, the 500 pounds a year middle classes, know<br>all about Mudie's and the Times Book Club when they're in their<br>cradles. A bit later I learned of the existence of lending<br>libraries and took out a subscription at Mudie's and another at a<br>library in Bristol. And what I read during the next year or so!<br>Wells, Conrad, Kipling, Galsworthy, Barry Pain, W. W. Jacobs, Pett<br>Ridge, Oliver Onions, Compton Mackenzie, H. Seton Merriman, Maurice<br>Baring, Stephen McKenna, May Sinclair, Arnold Bennett, Anthony<br>Hope, Elinor Glyn, O. Henry, Stephen Leacock, and even Silas<br>Hocking and Jean Stratton Porter. How many of the names in that<br>list are known to you, I wonder? Half the books that people took<br>seriously in those days are forgotten now. But at the beginning I<br>swallowed them all down like a whale that's got in among a shoal of<br>shrimps. I just revelled in them. After a bit, of course, I grew<br>more highbrow and began to distinguish between tripe and not-tripe.<br>I got hold of Lawrence's Sons and Lovers and sort of half-enjoyed<br>it, and I got a lot of kick out of Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray and<br>Stevenson's New Arabian Nights. Wells was the author who made the<br>biggest impression on me. I read George Moore's Esther Waters and<br>liked it, and I tried several of Hardy's novels and always got<br>stuck about half-way through. I even had a go at Ibsen, who left<br>me with a vague impression that in Norway it's always raining.<br><br>It was queer, really. Even at the time it struck me as queer. I<br>was a second-loot with hardly any Cockney accent left, I could<br>already distinguish between Arnold Bennett and Elinor Glyn, and yet<br>it was only four years since I'd been slicing cheese behind the<br>counter in my white apron and looking forward to the days when I'd<br>be a master-grocer. If I tot up the account, I suppose I must<br>admit that the war did me good as well as harm. At any rate that<br>year of reading novels was the only real education, in the sense of<br>book-learning, that I've ever had. It did certain things to my<br>mind. It gave me an attitude, a kind of questioning attitude,<br>which I probably wouldn't have had if I'd gone through life in a<br>normal sensible way. But--I wonder if you can understand this--the<br>thing that really changed me, really made an impression on me,<br>wasn't so much the books I read as the rotten meaninglessness of<br>the life I was leading.<br><br>It really was unspeakably meaningless, that time in 1918. Here I<br>was, sitting beside the stove in an Army hut, reading novels, and a<br>few hundred miles away in France the guns were roaring and droves<br>of wretched children, wetting their bags with fright, were being<br>driven into the machine-gun barrage like you'd shoot small coke<br>into a furnace. I was one of the lucky ones. The higher-ups had<br>taken their eye off me, and here I was in a snug little bolt-hole,<br>drawing pay for a job that didn't exist. At times I got into a<br>panic and made sure they'd remember about me and dig me out, but it<br>never happened. The official forms, on gritty grey paper, came in<br>once a month, and I filled them up and sent them back, and more<br>forms came in, and I filled them up and sent them back, and so it<br>went on. The whole thing had about as much sense in it as a<br>lunatic's dream. The effect of all this, plus the books I was<br>reading, was to leave me with a feeling of disbelief in everything.<br><br>I wasn't the only one. The war was full of loose ends and<br>forgotten corners. By this time literally millions of people were<br>stuck up backwaters of one kind and another. Whole armies were<br>rotting away on fronts that people had forgotten the names of.<br>There were huge Ministries with hordes of clerks and typists all<br>drawing two pounds a week and upwards for piling up mounds of<br>paper. Moreover they knew perfectly well that all they were doing<br>was to pile up mounds of paper. Nobody believed the atrocity<br>stories and the gallant little Belgium stuff any longer. The<br>soldiers thought the Germans were good fellows and hated the French<br>like poison. Every junior officer looked on the General Staff as<br>mental defectives. A sort of wave of disbelief was moving across<br>England, and it even got as far as Twelve Mile Dump. It would be<br>an exaggeration to say that the war turned people into highbrows,<br>but it did turn them into nihilists for the time being. People who<br>in a normal way would have gone through life with about as much<br>tendency to think for themselves as a suet pudding were turned into<br>Bolshies just by the war. What should I be now if it hadn't been<br>for the war? I don't know, but something different from what I am.<br>If the war didn't happen to kill you it was bound to start you<br>thinking. After that unspeakable idiotic mess you couldn't go on<br>regarding society as something eternal and unquestionable, like a<br>pyramid. You knew it was just a balls-up. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/10.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/12.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
