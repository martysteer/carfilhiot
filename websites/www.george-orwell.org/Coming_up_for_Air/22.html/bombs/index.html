<h2>Part 4, Chapter 6</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">After breakfast I strolled out into the market-place. It was a<br>lovely morning, kind of cool and still, with a pale yellow light<br>like white wine playing over everything. The fresh smell of the<br>morning was mixed up with the smell of my cigar. But there was a<br>zooming noise from behind the houses, and suddenly a fleet of great<br>black bombers came whizzing over. I looked up at them. They<br>seemed to be bang overhead.<br><br>The next moment I heard something. And at the same moment, if<br>you'd happened to be there, you'd have seen an interesting instance<br>of what I believe is called conditioned reflex. Because what I'd<br>heard--there wasn't any question of mistake--was the whistle of a<br>bomb. I hadn't heard such a thing for twenty years, but I didn't<br>need to be told what it was. And without taking any kind of<br>thought I did the right thing. I flung myself on my face.<br><br>After all I'm glad you didn't see me. I don't suppose I looked<br>dignified. I was flattened out on the pavement like a rat when it<br>squeezes under a door. Nobody else had been half as prompt. I'd<br>acted so quickly that in the split second while the bomb was<br>whistling down I even had time to be afraid that it was all a<br>mistake and I'd made a fool of myself for nothing.<br><br>But the next moment--ah!<br><br>BOOM-BRRRRR!<br><br>A noise like the Day of Judgment, and then a noise like a ton of<br>coal falling on to a sheet of tin. That was falling bricks. I<br>seemed to kind of melt into the pavement. 'It's started,' I<br>thought. 'I knew it! Old Hitler didn't wait. Just sent his<br>bombers across without warning.'<br><br>And yet here's a peculiar thing. Even in the echo of that awful,<br>deafening crash, which seemed to freeze me up from top to toe, I<br>had time to think that there's something grand about the bursting<br>of a big projectile. What does it sound like? It's hard to say,<br>because what you hear is mixed up with what you're frightened of.<br>Mainly it gives you a vision of bursting metal. You seem to see<br>great sheets of iron bursting open. But the peculiar thing is the<br>feeling it gives you of being suddenly shoved up against reality.<br>It's like being woken up by somebody shying a bucket of water over<br>you. You're suddenly dragged out of your dreams by a clang of<br>bursting metal, and it's terrible, and it's real.<br><br>There was a sound of screams and yells, and also of car brakes<br>being suddenly jammed on. The second bomb which I was waiting for<br>didn't fall. I raised my head a little. On every side people<br>seemed to be rushing round and screaming. A car was skidding<br>diagonally across the road, I could hear a woman's voice shrieking,<br>'The Germans! The Germans!' To the right I had a vague impression<br>of a man's round white face, rather like a wrinkled paper bag,<br>looking down at me. He was kind of dithering:<br><br>'What is it? What's happened? What are they doing?'<br><br>'It's started,' I said. 'That was a bomb. Lie down.'<br><br>But still the second bomb didn't fall. Another quarter of a minute<br>or so, and I raised my head again. Some of the people were still<br>rushing about, others were standing as if they'd been glued to the<br>ground. From somewhere behind the houses a huge haze of dust had<br>risen up, and through it a black jet of smoke was streaming<br>upwards. And then I saw an extraordinary sight. At the other end<br>of the market-place the High Street rises a little. And down this<br>little hill a herd of pigs was galloping, a sort of huge flood of<br>pig-faces. The next moment, of course, I saw what it was. It<br>wasn't pigs at all, it was only the schoolchildren in their gas-<br>masks. I suppose they were bolting for some cellar where they'd<br>been told to take cover in case of air-raids. At the back of them<br>I could even make out a taller pig who was probably Miss Todgers.<br>But I tell you for a moment they looked exactly like a herd of<br>pigs.<br><br>I picked myself up and walked across the market-place. People were<br>calming down already, and quite a little crowd had begun to flock<br>towards the place where the bomb had dropped.<br><br>Oh, yes, you're right, of course. It wasn't a German aeroplane<br>after all. The war hadn't broken out. It was only an accident.<br>The planes were flying over to do a bit of bombing practice--at any<br>rate they were carrying bombs--and somebody had put his hands on<br>the lever by mistake. I expect he got a good ticking off for it.<br>By the time that the postmaster had rung up London to ask whether<br>there was a war on, and been told that there wasn't, everyone had<br>grasped that it was an accident. But there'd been a space of time,<br>something between a minute and five minutes, when several thousand<br>people believed we were at war. A good job it didn't last any<br>longer. Another quarter of an hour and we'd have been lynching our<br>first spy.<br><br>I followed the crowd. The bomb had dropped in a little side-street<br>off the High Street, the one where Uncle Ezekiel used to have his<br>shop. It wasn't fifty yards from where the shop used to be. As I<br>came round the corner I could hear voices murmuring 'Oo-oo!'--a<br>kind of awed noise, as if they were frightened and getting a big<br>kick out of it. Luckily I got there a few minutes before the<br>ambulance and the fire-engine, and in spite of the fifty people or<br>so that had already collected I saw everything.<br><br>At first sight it looked as if the sky had been raining bricks and<br>vegetables. There were cabbage leaves everywhere. The bomb had<br>blown a greengrocer's shop out of existence. The house to the<br>right of it had part of its roof blown off, and the roof beams were<br>on fire, and all the houses round had been more or less damaged and<br>had their windows smashed. But what everyone was looking at was<br>the house on the left. Its wall, the one that joined the<br>greengrocer's shop, was ripped off as neatly as if someone had done<br>it with a knife. And what was extraordinary was that in the<br>upstairs rooms nothing had been touched. It was just like looking<br>into a doll's house. Chests-of-drawers, bedroom chairs, faded<br>wallpaper, a bed not yet made, and a jerry under the bed--all<br>exactly as it had been lived in, except that one wall was gone.<br>But the lower rooms had caught the force of the explosion. There<br>was a frightful smashed-up mess of bricks, plaster, chair-legs,<br>bits of a varnished dresser, rags of tablecloth, piles of broken<br>plates, and chunks of a scullery sink. A jar of marmalade had<br>rolled across the floor, leaving a long streak of marmalade behind,<br>and running side by side with it there was a ribbon of blood. But<br>in among the broken crockery there was lying a leg. Just a leg,<br>with the trouser still on it and a black boot with a Wood-Milne<br>rubber heel. This was what people were oo-ing and ah-ing at.<br><br>I had a good look at it and took it in. The blood was beginning to<br>get mixed up with the marmalade. When the fire-engine arrived I<br>cleared off to the George to pack my bag.<br><br>This finishes me with Lower Binfield, I thought. I'm going home.<br>But as a matter of fact I didn't shake the dust off my shoes and<br>leave immediately. One never does. When anything like that<br>happens, people always stand about and discuss it for hours. There<br>wasn't much work done in the old part of Lower Binfield that day,<br>everyone was too busy talking about the bomb, what it sounded like<br>and what they thought when they heard it. The barmaid at the<br>George said it fair gave her the shudders. She said she'd never<br>sleep sound in her bed again, and what did you expect, it just<br>showed that with these here <B style="color:black;background-color:#99CCFF">bombs</B> you never knew. A woman had<br>bitten off part of her tongue owing to the jump the explosion gave<br>her. It turned out that whereas at our end of the town everyone<br>had imagined it was a German air-raid, everyone at the other end<br>had taken it for granted that it was an explosion at the stocking<br>factory. Afterwards (I got this out of the newspaper) the Air<br>Ministry sent a chap to inspect the damage, and issued a report<br>saying that the effects of the bomb were 'disappointing'. As a<br>matter of fact it only killed three people, the greengrocer,<br>Perrott his name was, and an old couple who lived next door. The<br>woman wasn't much smashed about, and they identified the old man by<br>his boots, but they never found a trace of Perrott. Not even a<br>trouser-button to read the burial service over.<br><br>In the afternoon I paid my bill and hooked it. I didn't have much<br>more than three quid left after I'd paid the bill. They know how<br>to cut it out of you these dolled-up country hotels, and what with<br>drinks and other odds and ends I'd been shying money about pretty<br>freely. I left my new rod and the rest of the fishing tackle in my<br>bedroom. Let 'em keep it. No use to me. It was merely a quid<br>that I'd chucked down the drain to teach myself a lesson. And I'd<br>learnt the lesson all right. Fat men of forty-five can't go<br>fishing. That kind of thing doesn't happen any longer, it's just<br>a dream, there'll be no more fishing this side of the grave.<br><br>It's funny how things sink into you by degrees. What had I really<br>felt when the bomb exploded? At the actual moment, of course, it<br>scared the wits out of me, and when I saw the smashed-up house and<br>the old man's leg I'd had the kind of mild kick that you get from<br>seeing a street-accident. Disgusting, of course. Quite enough to<br>make me fed-up with this so-called holiday. But it hadn't really<br>made much impression.<br><br>But as I got clear of the outskirts of Lower Binfield and turned<br>the car eastward, it all came back to me. You know how it is when<br>you're in a car alone. There's something either in the hedges<br>flying past you, or in the throb of the engine, that gets your<br>thoughts running in a certain rhythm. You have the same feeling<br>sometimes when you're in the train. It's a feeling of being able<br>to see things in better perspective than usual. All kinds of<br>things that I'd been doubtful about I felt certain about now. To<br>begin with, I'd come to Lower Binfield with a question in my mind.<br>What's ahead of us? Is the game really up? Can we get back to the<br>life we used to live, or is it gone for ever? Well, I'd had my<br>answer. The old life's finished, and to go back to Lower Binfield,<br>you can't put Jonah back into the whale. I KNEW, though I don't<br>expect you to follow my train of thought. And it was a queer thing<br>I'd done coming here. All those years Lower Binfield had been<br>tucked away somewhere or other in my mind, a sort of quiet corner<br>that I could step back into when I felt like it, and finally I'd<br>stepped back into it and found that it didn't exist. I'd chucked a<br>pineapple into my dreams, and lest there should be any mistake the<br>Royal Air Force had followed up with five hundred pounds of T.N.T.<br><br>War is coming. 1941, they say. And there'll be plenty of broken<br>crockery, and little houses ripped open like packing-cases, and the<br>guts of the chartered accountant's clerk plastered over the piano<br>that he's buying on the never-never. But what does that kind of<br>thing matter, anyway? I'll tell you what my stay in Lower Binfield<br>had taught me, and it was this. IT'S ALL GOING TO HAPPEN. All the<br>things you've got at the back of your mind, the things you're<br>terrified of, the things that you tell yourself are just a<br>nightmare or only happen in foreign countries. The <B style="color:black;background-color:#99CCFF">bombs</B>  the<br>food-queues, the rubber truncheons, the barbed wire, the coloured<br>shirts, the slogans, the enormous faces, the machine-guns squirting<br>out of bedroom windows. It's all going to happen. I know it--at<br>any rate, I knew it then. There's no escape. Fight against it if<br>you like, or look the other way and pretend not to notice, or grab<br>your spanner and rush out to do a bit of face-smashing along with<br>the others. But there's no way out. It's just something that's<br>got to happen.<br><br>I trod on the gas, and the old car whizzed up and down the little<br>hills, and the cows and elm trees and fields of wheat rushed past<br>till the engine was pretty nearly red-hot. I felt in much the same<br>mood as I'd felt that day in January when I was coming down the<br>Strand, the day I got my new false teeth. It was as though the<br>power of prophecy had been given me. It seemed to me that I could<br>see the whole of England, and all the people in it, and all the<br>things that'll happen to all of them. Sometimes, of course, even<br>then, I had a doubt or two. The world is very large, that's a<br>thing you notice when you're driving about in a car, and in a way<br>it's reassuring. Think of the enormous stretches of land you pass<br>over when you cross a corner of a single English county. It's like<br>Siberia. And the fields and beech spinneys and farmhouses and<br>churches, and the villages with their little grocers' shops and the<br>parish hall and the ducks walking across the green. Surely it's<br>too big to be changed? Bound to remain more or less the same. And<br>presently I struck into outer London and followed the Uxbridge Road<br>as far as Southall. Miles and miles of ugly houses, with people<br>living dull decent lives inside them. And beyond it London<br>stretching on and on, streets, squares, back-alleys, tenements,<br>blocks of flats, pubs, fried-fish shops, picture-houses, on and on<br>for twenty miles, and all the eight million people with their<br>little private lives which they don't want to have altered. The<br <B style="color:black;background-color:#99CCFF">bombs</B> aren't made that could smash it out of existence. And the<br>chaos of it! The privateness of all those lives! John Smith<br>cutting out the football coupons, Bill Williams swapping stories in<br>the barber's. Mrs Jones coming home with the supper beer. Eight<br>million of them! Surely they'll manage somehow, <B style="color:black;background-color:#99CCFF">bombs</B> or no <B style="color:black;background-color:#99CCFF">bombs</B> <br>to keep on with the life that they've been used to?<br><br>Illusion! Baloney! It doesn't matter how many of them there are,<br>they're all for it. The bad times are coming, and the streamlined<br>men are coming too. What's coming afterwards I don't know, it<br>hardly even interests me. I only know that if there's anything you<br>care a curse about, better say good-bye to it now, because<br>everything you've ever known is going down, down, into the muck,<br>with the machine-guns rattling all the time.<br><br>But when I got back to the suburb my mood suddenly changed.<br><br>It suddenly struck me--and it hadn't even crossed my mind till that<br>moment--that Hilda might really be ill after all.<br><br>That's the effect of environment, you see. In Lower Binfield I'd<br>taken it absolutely for granted that she wasn't ill and was merely<br>shamming in order to get me home. It had seemed natural at the<br>time, I don't know why. But as I drove into West Bletchley and the<br>Hesperides Estate closed round me like a kind of red-brick prison,<br>which is what it is, the ordinary habits of thought came back. I<br>had this kind of Monday morning feeling when everything seems bleak<br>and sensible. I saw what bloody rot it was, this business that I'd<br>wasted the last five days on. Sneaking off to Lower Binfield to<br>try and recover the past, and then, in the car coming home,<br>thinking a lot of prophetic baloney about the future. The future!<br>What's the future got to do with chaps like you and me? Holding<br>down our jobs--that's our future. As for Hilda, even when the<br <B style="color:black;background-color:#99CCFF">bombs</B> are dropping she'll be still thinking about the price of<br>butter.<br><br>And suddenly I saw what a fool I'd been to think she'd do a thing<br>like that. Of course the S.O.S. wasn't a fake! As though she'd<br>have the imagination! It was just the plain cold truth. She<br>wasn't shamming at all, she was really ill. And Gosh! at this<br>moment she might be lying somewhere in ghastly pain, or even dead,<br>for all I knew. The thought sent a most horrible pang of fright<br>through me, a sort of dreadful cold feeling in my guts. I whizzed<br>down Ellesmere Road at nearly forty miles an hour, and instead of<br>taking the car to the lock-up garage as usual I stopped outside the<br>house and jumped out.<br><br>So I'm fond of Hilda after all, you say! I don't know exactly what<br>you mean by fond. Are you fond of your own face? Probably not,<br>but you can't imagine yourself without it. It's part of you.<br>Well, that's how I felt about Hilda. When things are going well I<br>can't stick the sight of her, but the thought that she might be<br>dead or even in pain sent the shivers through me.<br><br>I fumbled with the key, got the door open, and the familiar smell<br>of old mackintoshes hit me.<br><br>'Hilda!' I yelled. 'Hilda!'<br><br>No answer. For a moment I was yelling 'Hilda! Hilda!' into utter<br>silence, and some cold sweat started out on my backbone. Maybe<br>they carted her away to hospital already--maybe there was a corpse<br>lying upstairs in the empty house.<br><br>I started to dash up the stairs, but at the same moment the two<br>kids, in their pyjamas, came out of their rooms on either side of<br>the landing. It was eight or nine o'clock, I suppose--at any rate<br>the light was just beginning to fail. Lorna hung over the<br>banisters.<br><br>'Oo, Daddy! Oo, it's Daddy! Why have you come back today? Mummy<br>said you weren't coming till Friday.'<br><br>'Where's your mother?' I said.<br><br>'Mummy's out. She went out with Mrs Wheeler. Why have you come<br>home today, Daddy?'<br><br>'Then your mother hasn't been ill?'<br><br>'No. Who said she'd been ill? Daddy! Have you been in Birmingham?'<br><br>'Yes. Get back to bed, now. You'll be catching cold.'<br><br>'But where's our presents, Daddy?'<br><br>'What presents?'<br><br>'The presents you've bought us from Birmingham.'<br><br>'You'll see them in the morning,' I said.<br><br>'Oo, Daddy! Can't we see them tonight?'<br><br>'No. Dry up. Get back to bed or I'll wallop the pair of you.'<br><br>So she wasn't ill after all. She HAD been shamming. And really I<br>hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry. I turned back to the<br>front door, which I'd left open, and there, as large as life, was<br>Hilda coming up the garden path.<br><br>I looked at her as she came towards me in the last of the evening<br>light. It was queer to think that less than three minutes earlier<br>I'd been in the devil of a stew, with actual cold sweat on my<br>backbone, at the thought that she might be dead. Well, she wasn't<br>dead, she was just as usual. Old Hilda with her thin shoulders and<br>her anxious face, and the gas bill and the school-fees, and the<br>mackintoshy smell and the office on Monday--all the bedrock facts<br>that you invariably come back to, the eternal verities as old<br>Porteous calls them. I could see that Hilda wasn't in too good a<br>temper. She darted me a little quick look, like she does sometimes<br>when she's got something on her mind, the kind of look some little<br>thin animal, a weasel for instance, might give you. She didn't<br>seem surprised to see me back, however.<br><br>'Oh, so you're back already, are you?' she said.<br><br>It seemed pretty obvious that I was back, and I didn't answer. She<br>didn't make any move to kiss me.<br><br>'There's nothing for your supper,' she went on promptly. That's<br>Hilda all over. Always manages to say something depressing the<br>instant you set foot inside the house. 'I wasn't expecting you.<br>You'll just have to have bread and cheese--but I don't think we've<br>got any cheese.'<br><br>I followed her indoors, into the smell of mackintoshes. We went<br>into the sitting-room. I shut the door and switched on the light.<br>I meant to get my say in first, and I knew it would make things<br>better if I took a strong line from the start.<br><br>'Now', I said, 'what the bloody hell do you mean by playing that<br>trick on me?'<br><br>She'd just laid her bag down on top of the radio, and for a moment<br>she looked genuinely surprised.<br><br>'What trick? What do you mean?'<br><br>'Sending out that S.O.S.!'<br><br>'What S.O.S.? What are you TALKING about, George?'<br><br>'Are you trying to tell me you didn't get them to send out an<br>S.O.S. saying you were seriously ill?'<br><br>'Of course I didn't! How could I? I wasn't ill. What would I do<br>a thing like that for?'<br><br>I began to explain, but almost before I began I saw what had<br>happened. It was all a mistake. I'd only heard the last few words<br>of the S.O.S. and obviously it was some other Hilda Bowling. I<br>suppose there'd be scores of Hilda Bowlings if you looked the name<br>up in the directory. It just was the kind of dull stupid mistake<br>that's always happening. Hilda hadn't even showed that little bit<br>of imagination I'd credited her with. The sole interest in the<br>whole affair had been the five minutes or so when I thought she was<br>dead, and found that I cared after all. But that was over and done<br>with. While I explained she was watching me, and I could see in<br>her eye that there was trouble of some kind coming. And then she<br>began questioning me in what I call her third-degree voice, which<br>isn't, as you might expect, angry and nagging, but quiet and kind<br>of watchful.<br><br>'So you heard this S.O.S. in the hotel at Birmingham?'<br><br>'Yes. Last night, on the National Broadcast.'<br><br>'When did you leave Birmingham, then?'<br><br>'This morning, of course.' (I'd planned out the journey in my<br>mind, just in case there should be any need to lie my way out of<br>it. Left at ten, lunch at Coventry, tea at Bedford--I'd got it all<br>mapped out.)<br><br>'So you thought last night I was seriously ill, and you didn't even<br>leave till this morning?'<br><br>'But I tell you I didn't think you were ill. Haven't I explained?<br>I thought it was just another of your tricks. It sounded a damn<br>sight more likely.'<br><br>'Then I'm rather surprised you left at all!' she said with so much<br>vinegar in her voice that I knew there was something more coming.<br>But she went on more quietly: 'So you left this morning, did you?'<br><br>'Yes. I left about ten. I had lunch at Coventry--'<br><br>'Then how do you account for THIS?' she suddenly shot out at me,<br>and in the same instant she ripped her bag open, took out a piece<br>of paper, and held it out as if it had been a forged cheque, or<br>something.<br><br>I felt as if someone had hit me a sock in the wind. I might have<br>known it! She'd caught me after all. And there was the evidence,<br>the dossier of the case. I didn't even know what it was, except<br>that it was something that proved I'd been off with a woman. All<br>the stuffing went out of me. A moment earlier I'd been kind of<br>bullying her, making out to be angry because I'd been dragged back<br>from Birmingham for nothing, and now she'd suddenly turned the<br>tables on me. You don't have to tell me what I look like at that<br>moment. I know. Guilt written all over me in big letters--I know.<br>And I wasn't even guilty! But it's a matter of habit. I'm used to<br>being in the wrong. For a hundred quid I couldn't have kept the<br>guilt out of my voice as I answered:<br><br>'What do you mean? What's that thing you've got there?'<br><br>'You read it and you'll see what it is.'<br><br>I took it. It was a letter from what seemed to be a firm of<br>solicitors, and it was addressed from the same street as<br>Rowbottom's Hotel, I noticed.<br><br>'Dear Madam,' I read, 'With reference to your letter of the 18th<br>inst., we think there must be some mistake. Rowbottom's Hotel was<br>closed down two years ago and has been converted into a block of<br>offices. No one answering the description of your husband has been<br>here. Possibly--'<br><br>I didn't read any further. Of course I saw it all in a flash. I'd<br>been a little bit too clever and put my foot in it. There was just<br>one faint ray of hope--young Saunders might have forgotten to post<br>the letter I'd addressed from Rowbottom's, in which case it was<br>just possible I could brazen it out. But Hilda soon put the lid on<br>that idea.<br><br>'Well, George, you see what the letter says? The day you left here<br>I wrote to Rowbottom's Hotel--oh, just a little note, asking them<br>whether you'd arrived there. And you see the answer I got! There<br>isn't even any such place as Rowbottom's Hotel. And the same day,<br>the very same post, I got your letter saying you were at the hotel.<br>You got someone to post it for you, I suppose. THAT was your<br>business in Birmingham!'<br><br>'But look here, Hilda! You've got all this wrong. It isn't what<br>you think at all. You don't understand.'<br><br>'Oh, yes, I do, George. I understand PERFECTLY.'<br><br>'But look here, Hilda--'<br><br>Wasn't any use, of course. It was a fair cop. I couldn't even<br>meet her eye. I turned and tried to make for the door.<br><br>'I'll have to take the car round to the garage,' I said.<br><br>'Oh, no George! You don't get out of it like that. You'll stay<br>here and listen to what I've got to say, please.'<br><br>'But, damn it! I've got to switch the lights on, haven't I? It's<br>past lighting-up time. You don't want us to get fined?'<br><br>At that she let me go, and I went out and switched the car lights<br>on, but when I came back she was still standing there like a figure<br>of doom, with the two letters, mine and the solicitor's on the<br>table in front of her. I'd got a little of my nerve back, and I<br>had another try:<br><br>'Listen, Hilda. You've got hold of the wrong end of the stick<br>about this business. I can explain the whole thing.'<br><br>'I'm sure YOU could explain anything, George. The question is<br>whether I'd believe you.'<br><br>'But you're just jumping to conclusions! What made you write to<br>these hotel people, anyway?'<br><br>'It was Mrs Wheeler's idea. And a very good idea too, as it turned<br>out.'<br><br>'Oh, Mrs Wheeler, was it? So you don't mind letting that blasted<br>woman into our private affairs?'<br><br>'She didn't need any letting in. It was she who warned me what you<br>were up to this week. Something seemed to tell her, she said. And<br>she was right, you see. She knows all about you, George. She used<br>to have a husband JUST like you.'<br><br>'But, Hilda--'<br><br>I looked at her. Her face had gone a kind of white under the<br>surface, the way it does when she thinks of me with another woman.<br>A woman. If only it had been true!<br><br>And Gosh! what I could see ahead of me! You know what it's like.<br>The weeks on end of ghastly nagging and sulking, and the catty<br>remarks after you think peace has been signed, and the meals always<br>late, and the kids wanting to know what it's all about. But what<br>really got me down was the kind of mental squalor, the kind of<br>mental atmosphere in which the real reason why I'd gone to Lower<br>Binfield wouldn't even be conceivable. That was what chiefly<br>struck me at the moment. If I spent a week explaining to Hilda WHY<br>I'd been to Lower Binfield, she'd never understand. And who WOULD<br>understand, here in Ellesmere Road? Gosh! did I even understand<br>myself? The whole thing seemed to be fading out of my mind. Why<br>had I gone to Lower Binfield? HAD I gone there? In this<br>atmosphere it just seemed meaningless. Nothing's real in Ellesmere<br>Road except gas bills, school-fees, boiled cabbage, and the office<br>on Monday.<br><br>One more try:<br><br>'But look here, Hilda! I know what you think. But you're<br>absolutely wrong. I swear to you you're wrong.'<br><br>'Oh, no, George. If I was wrong why did you have to tell all those<br>lies?'<br><br>No getting away from that, of course.<br><br>I took a pace or two up and down. The smell of old mackintoshes<br>was very strong. Why had I run away like that? Why had I bothered<br>about the future and the past, seeing that the future and the past<br>don't matter? Whatever motives I might have had, I could hardly<br>remember them now. The old life in Lower Binfield, the war and the<br>after-war, Hitler, Stalin, <B style="color:black;background-color:#99CCFF">bombs</B>  machine-guns, food-queues, rubber<br>truncheons--it was fading out, all fading out. Nothing remained<br>except a vulgar low-down row in a smell of old mackintoshes.<br><br>One last try:<br><br>'Hilda! Just listen to me a minute. Look here, you don't know<br>where I've been all this week, do you?'<br><br>'I don't want to know where you've been. I know WHAT you've been<br>doing. That's quite enough for me.'<br><br>'But dash it--'<br><br>Quite useless, of course. She'd found me guilty and now she was<br>going to tell me what she thought of me. That might take a couple<br>of hours. And after that there was further trouble looming up,<br>because presently it would occur to her to wonder where I'd got the<br>money for this trip, and then she'd discover that I'd been holding<br>out on her about the seventeen quid. Really there was no reason<br>why this row shouldn't go on till three in the morning. No use<br>playing injured innocence any longer. All I wanted was the line of<br>least resistance. And in my mind I ran over the three possibilities,<br>which were:<br><br>A. To tell her what I'd really been doing and somehow make her<br>believe me.<br><br>B. To pull the old gag about losing my memory.<br><br>C. To let her go on thinking it was a woman, and take my medicine.<br><br>But, damn it! I knew which it would have to be.<br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Coming_up_for_Air/21.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center></font></p>
