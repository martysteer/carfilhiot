<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">From a very early age, perhaps the age of five or six, I knew that when I<br>grew up I should be a writer. Between the ages of about seventeen and<br>twenty-four I tried to abandon this idea, but I did so with the<br>consciousness that I was outraging my true nature and that sooner or<br>later I should have to settle down and write books.<br><br>I was the middle child of three, but there was a gap of five years on<br>either side, and I barely saw my father before I was eight. For this and<br>other reasons I was somewhat lonely, and I soon developed disagreeable<br>mannerisms which made me unpopular throughout my schooldays. I had the<br>lonely child's habit of making up stories and holding conversations with<br>imaginary persons, and I think from the very start my literary ambitions<br>were mixed up with the feeling of being isolated and undervalued. I knew<br>that I had a facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts,<br>and I felt that this created a sort of private world in which I could get<br>my own back for my failure in everyday life. Nevertheless the volume of<br>serious--i.e. seriously intended--writing which I produced all through<br>my childhood and boyhood would not amount to half a dozen pages. I wrote<br>my first poem at the age of four or five, my mother taking it down to<br>dictation. I cannot remember anything about it except that it was about a<br>tiger and the tiger had 'chair-like teeth'--a good enough phrase, but I<br>fancy the poem was a plagiarism of Blake's 'Tiger, Tiger'. At eleven,<br>when the war or 1914-18 broke out, I wrote a patriotic poem which was<br>printed in the local newspaper, as was another, two years later, on the<br>death of Kitchener. From time to time, when I was a bit older, I wrote<br>bad and usually unfinished 'nature poems' in the Georgian style. I also<br>attempted a short story which was a ghastly failure. That was the total<br>of the would-be serious work that I actually set down on paper during all<br>those years.<br><br>However, throughout this time I did in a sense engage in literary<br>activities. To begin with there was the made-to-order stuff which I<br>produced quickly, easily and without much pleasure to myself. Apart from<br>school work, I wrote VERS D'OCCASION, semi-comic poems which I could turn<br>out at what now seems to me astonishing speed--at fourteen I wrote a<br>whole rhyming play, in imitation of Aristophanes, in about a week--and<br>helped to edit a school magazines, both printed and in manuscript. These<br>magazines were the most pitiful burlesque stuff that you could imagine,<br>and I took far less trouble with them than I now would with the cheapest<br>journalism. But side by side with all this, for fifteen years or more, I<br>was carrying out a literary exercise of a quite different kind: this was<br>the making up of a continuous 'story' about myself, a sort of diary<br>existing only in the mind. I believe this is a common habit of children<br>and adolescents. As a very small child I used to imagine that I was, say,<br>Robin Hood, and picture myself as the hero of thrilling adventures, but<br>quite soon my 'story' ceased to be narcissistic in a crude way and became<br>more and more a mere description of what I was doing and the things I<br>saw. For minutes at a time this kind of thing would be running through my<br>head: 'He pushed the door open and entered the room. A yellow beam of<br>sunlight, filtering through the muslin curtains, slanted on to the table,<br>where a match-box, half-open, lay beside the inkpot. With his right hand<br>in his pocket he moved across to the window. Down in the street a<br>tortoiseshell cat was chasing a dead leaf', etc. etc. This habit<br>continued until I was about twenty-five, right through my non-literary<br>years. Although I had to search, and did search, for the right words, I<br>seemed to be making this descriptive effort almost against my will, under<br>a kind of compulsion from outside. The 'story' must, I suppose, have<br>reflected the styles of the various writers I admired at different ages,<br>but so far as I remember it always had the same meticulous descriptive<br>quality.<br><br>When I was about sixteen I suddenly discovered the joy of mere words,<br>i.e. the sounds and associations of words. The lines from PARADISE LOST,<br><br>So hee with difficulty and labour hard<br>Moved on: with difficulty and labour hee.<br><br>which do not now seem to me so very wonderful, sent shivers down my<br>backbone; and the spelling 'hee' for 'he' was an added pleasure. As for<br>the need to describe things, I knew all about it already. So it is clear<br>what kind of books I wanted to write, in so far as I could be said to<br>want to write books at that time. I wanted to write enormous naturalistic<br>novels with unhappy endings, full of detailed descriptions and arresting<br>similes, and also full of purple passages in which words were used partly<br>for the sake of their own sound. And in fact my first completed novel,<br>BURMESE DAYS, which I wrote when I was thirty but projected much earlier,<br>is rather that kind of book.<br><br>I give all this background information because I do not think one can<br>assess a writer's motives without knowing something of his early<br>development. His subject matter will be determined by the age he lives in<br>--at least this is true in tumultuous, revolutionary ages like our own--<br>but before he ever begins to write he will have acquired an emotional<br>attitude from which he will never completely escape. It is his job, no<br>doubt, to discipline his temperament and avoid getting stuck at some<br>immature stage, in some perverse mood; but if he escapes from his early<br>influences altogether, he will have killed his impulse to write. Putting<br>aside the need to earn a living, I think there are four great motives for<br>writing, at any rate for writing prose. They exist in different degrees<br>in every writer, and in any one writer the proportions will vary from<br>time to time, according to the atmosphere in which he is living. They<br>are:<br><br>(i) Sheer egoism. Desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be<br>remembered after death, to get your own back on the grown-ups who snubbed<br>you in childhood, etc., etc. It is humbug to pretend this is not a<br>motive, and a strong one. Writers share this characteristic with<br>scientists, artists, politicians, lawyers, soldiers, successful<br>businessmen--in short, with the whole top crust of humanity. The great<br>mass of human beings are not acutely selfish. After the age of about<br>thirty they almost abandon the sense of being individuals at all--and<br>live chiefly for others, or are simply smothered under drudgery. But<br>there is also the minority of gifted, willful people who are determined<br>to live their own lives to the end, and writers belong in this class.<br>Serious writers, I should say, are on the whole more vain and<br>self-centered than journalists, though less interested in money.<br><br>(ii) Aesthetic enthusiasm. Perception of beauty in the external world,<br>or, on the other hand, in words and their right arrangement. Pleasure in<br>the impact of one sound on another, in the firmness of good prose or the<br>rhythm of a good story. Desire to share an experience which one feels is<br>valuable and ought not to be missed. The aesthetic motive is very feeble<br>in a lot of writers, but even a pamphleteer or writer of textbooks will<br>have pet words and phrases which appeal to him for non-utilitarian<br>reasons; or he may feel strongly about typography, width of margins, etc.<br>Above the level of a railway guide, no book is quite free from aesthetic<br>considerations.<br><br>(iii) Historical impulse. Desire to see things as they are, to find out<br>true facts and store them up for the use of posterity.<br><br>(iv) Political purpose.--Using the word 'political' in the widest<br>possible sense. Desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter<br>other peoples' idea of the kind of society that they should strive after.<br>Once again, no book is genuinely free from political bias. The opinion<br>that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political<br>attitude.<br><br>It can be seen how these various impulses must war against one another,<br>and how they must fluctuate from person to person and from time to time.<br>By nature--taking your 'nature' to be the state you have attained when<br>you are first adult--I am a person in whom the first three motives would<br>outweigh the fourth. In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or<br>merely descriptive books, and might have remained almost unaware of my<br>political loyalties. As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of<br>pamphleteer. First I spent five years in an unsuitable profession (the<br>Indian Imperial Police, in Burma), and then I underwent poverty and the<br>sense of failure. This increased my natural hatred of authority and made<br>me for the first time fully aware of the existence of the working<br>classes, and the job in Burma had given me some understanding of the<br>nature of imperialism: but these experiences were not enough to give me<br>an accurate political orientation. Then came Hitler, the Spanish Civil<br>War, etc. By the end of 1935 I had still failed to reach a firm decision.<br>I remember a little poem that I wrote at that date, expressing my<br>dilemma:<br><br>A happy vicar I might have been<br>Two hundred years ago<br>To preach upon eternal doom<br>And watch my walnuts grow;<br><br>But born, alas, in an evil time,<br>I missed that pleasant haven,<br>For the hair has grown on my upper lip<br>And the clergy are all clean-shaven.<br><br>And later still the times were good,<br>We were so easy to please,<br>We rocked our troubled thoughts to sleep<br>On the bosoms of the trees.<br><br>All ignorant we dared to own<br>The joys we now dissemble;<br>The greenfinch on the apple bough<br>Could make my enemies tremble.<br><br>But girl's bellies and apricots,<br>Roach in a shaded stream,<br>Horses, ducks in flight at dawn,<br>All these are a dream.<br><br>It is forbidden to dream again;<br>We maim our joys or hide them:<br>Horses are made of chromium steel<br>And little fat men shall ride them.<br><br>I am the worm who never turned,<br>The eunuch without a harem;<br>Between the priest and the commissar<br>I walk like Eugene Aram;<br><br>And the commissar is telling my fortune<br>While the radio plays,<br>But the priest has promised an Austin Seven,<br>For Duggie always pays.<br><br>I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls,<br>And woke to find it true;<br>I wasn't born for an age like this;<br>Was Smith? Was Jones? Were you?<br><br>The Spanish war and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and<br>thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have<br>written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, AGAINST<br>totalitarianism and FOR democratic socialism, as I understand it. It<br>seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own, to think that one can<br>avoid writing of such subjects. Everyone writes of them in one guise or<br>another. It is simply a question of which side one takes and what<br>approach one follows. And the more one is conscious of one's political<br>bias, the more chance one has of acting politically without sacrificing<br>one's aesthetic and intellectual integrity.<br><br>What I have most wanted to do throughout the past ten years is to make<br>political writing into an art. My starting point is always a feeling of<br>partisanship, a sense of injustice. When I sit down to write a book, I do<br>not say to myself, 'I am going to produce a work of art'. I write it<br>because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I<br>want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing. But I<br>could not do the work of writing a book, or even a long magazine article,<br>if it were not also an aesthetic experience. Anyone who cares to examine<br>my work will see that even when it is downright propaganda it contains<br>much that a full-time politician would consider irrelevant. I am not<br>able, and do not want, completely to abandon the world view that I<br>acquired in childhood. So long as I remain alive and well I shall<br>continue to feel strongly about prose style, to love the surface of the<br>earth, and to take a pleasure in solid objects and scraps of useless<br>information. It is no use trying to suppress that side of myself. The job<br>is to reconcile my ingrained likes and dislikes with the essentially<br>public, non-individual activities that this age forces on all of us.<br><br>It is not easy. It raises problems of construction and of language, and<br>it raises in a new way the problem of truthfulness. Let me give just one<br>example of the cruder kind of difficulty that arises. My book about the<br>Spanish civil war, HOMAGE TO CATALONIA, is of course a frankly political<br>book, but in the main it is written with a certain detachment and regard<br>for form. I did try very hard in it to tell the whole truth without<br>violating my literary instincts. But among other things it contains a<br>long chapter, full of newspaper quotations and the like, defending the<br>Trotskyists who were accused of plotting with Franco. Clearly such a<br>chapter, which after a year or two would lose its interest for any<br>ordinary reader, must ruin the book. A critic whom I respect read me a<br>lecture about it. 'Why did you put in all that stuff?' he said. 'You've<br>turned what might have been a good book into journalism.' What he said<br>was true, but I could not have done otherwise. I happened to know, what<br>very few people in England had been allowed to know, that innocent men<br>were being falsely accused. If I had not been angry about that I should<br>never have written the book.<br><br>In one form or another this problem comes up again. The problem of<br>language is subtler and would take too long to discuss. I will only say<br>that of late years I have tried to write less picturesquely and more<br>exactly. In any case I find that by the time you have perfected any style<br>of writing, you have always outgrown it. ANIMAL FARM was the first book<br>in which I tried, with full consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse<br>political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole. I have not written<br>a novel for seven years, but I hope to write another fairly soon. It is<br>bound to be a failure, every book is a failure, but I do know with some<br>clarity what kind of book I want to write.<br><br>Looking back through the last page or two, I see that I have made it<br>appear as though my motives in writing were wholly public-spirited. I<br>don't want to leave that as the final impression. All writers are vain,<br>selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a<br>mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long<br>bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if<br>one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor<br>understand. For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that<br>makes a baby squall for attention. And yet it is also true that one can<br>write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one's<br>own personality. Good prose is like a windowpane. I cannot say with<br>certainty which of my motives are the strongest, but I know which of them<br>deserve to be followed. And looking back through my work, I see that it<br>is invariably where I lacked a POLITICAL purpose that I wrote lifeless<br>books and was betrayed into purple passages, sentences without meaning,<br>decorative adjectives and humbug generally.<br><br></font></p>
