<h2>Chapter VI</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>All that year the animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in their<br>work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that<br>they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who<br>would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.<br><br>Throughout the spring and summer they worked a sixty-hour week, and in<br>August Napoleon announced that there would be work on Sunday afternoons<br>as well. This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented<br>himself from it would have his rations reduced by half. Even so, it was<br>found necessary to leave certain tasks undone. The harvest was a little<br>less successful than in the previous year, and two fields which should<br>have been sown with roots in the early summer were not sown because the<br>ploughing had not been completed early enough. It was possible to foresee<br>that the coming winter would be a hard one.<br><br>The windmill presented unexpected difficulties. There was a good quarry of<br>limestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been found in one<br>of the outhouses, so that all the materials for building were at hand. But<br>the problem the animals could not at first solve was how to break up the<br>stone into pieces of suitable size. There seemed no way of doing this<br>except with picks and crowbars, which no animal could use, because no<br>animal could stand on his hind legs. Only after weeks of vain effort did<br>the right idea occur to somebody-namely, to utilise the force of gravity.<br>Huge boulders, far too big to be used as they were, were lying all over<br>the bed of the quarry. The animals lashed ropes round these, and then all<br>together, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could lay hold of the<br>rope--even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments--they dragged<br>them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry, where<br>they were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below. Transporting<br>the stone when it was once broken was comparatively simple. The horses<br>carried it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even Muriel<br>and Benjamin yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their<br>share. By late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and<br>then the building began, under the superintendence of the pigs.<br><br>But it was a slow, laborious process. Frequently it took a whole day of<br>exhausting effort to drag a single boulder to the top of the quarry, and<br>sometimes when it was pushed over the edge it failed to break. Nothing<br>could have been achieved without Boxer, whose strength seemed equal to<br>that of all the rest of the animals put together. When the boulder began<br>to slip and the animals cried out in despair at finding themselves dragged<br>down the hill, it was always Boxer who strained himself against the rope<br>and brought the boulder to a stop. To see him toiling up the slope inch by<br>inch, his breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs clawing at the ground,<br>and his great sides matted with sweat, filled everyone with admiration.<br>Clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to overstrain himself, but<br>Boxer would never listen to her. His two slogans, "I will work harder"<br>and "Napoleon is always right," seemed to him a sufficient answer to all<br>problems. He had made arrangements with the cockerel to call him<br>three-quarters of an hour earlier in the mornings instead of half an hour.<br>And in his spare moments, of which there were not many nowadays, he would<br>go alone to the quarry, collect a load of broken stone, and drag it down<br>to the site of the windmill unassisted.<br><br>The animals were not badly off throughout that summer, in spite of the<br>hardness of their work. If they had no more food than they had had in<br>Jones's day, at least they did not have less. The advantage of only having<br>to feed themselves, and not having to support five extravagant human<br>beings as well, was so great that it would have taken a lot of failures to<br>outweigh it. And in many ways the animal method of doing things was more<br>efficient and saved labour. Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be<br>done with a thoroughness impossible to human beings. And again, since no<br>animal now stole, it was unnecessary to fence off pasture from arable<br>land, which saved a lot of labour on the upkeep of hedges and gates.<br>Nevertheless, as the summer wore on, various unforeseen shortages began to<br>make them selves felt. There was need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dog<br>biscuits, and iron for the horses' shoes, none of which could be produced<br>on the farm. Later there would also be need for seeds and artificial<br>manures, besides various tools and, finally, the machinery for the<br>windmill. How these were to be procured, no one was able to imagine.<br><br>One Sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their orders,<br>Napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy. From now onwards<br>Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of<br>course, for any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certain<br>materials which were urgently necessary. The needs of the windmill must<br>override everything else, he said. He was therefore making arrangements to<br>sell a stack of hay and part of the current year's wheat crop, and later<br>on, if more money were needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of<br>eggs, for which there was always a market in Willingdon. The hens, said<br>Napoleon, should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contribution<br>towards the building of the windmill.<br><br>Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness. Never to have<br>any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to make<br>use of money--had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at<br>that first triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled? All the animals<br>remembered passing such resolutions: or at least they thought that they<br>remembered it. The four young pigs who had protested when Napoleon<br>abolished the Meetings raised their voices timidly, but they were promptly<br>silenced by a tremendous growling from the dogs. Then, as usual, the sheep<br>broke into "Four legs good, two legs bad!" and the momentary awkwardness<br>was smoothed over. Finally Napoleon raised his trotter for silence and<br>announced that he had already made all the arrangements. There would be no<br>need for any of the animals to come in contact with human beings, which<br>would clearly be most undesirable. He intended to take the whole burden<br>upon his own shoulders. A Mr. Whymper, a solicitor living in Willingdon,<br>had agreed to act as intermediary between Animal Farm and the outside<br>world, and would visit the farm every Monday morning to receive his<br>instructions. Napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of "Long live<br>Animal Farm!" and after the singing of 'Beasts of England' the animals<br>were dismissed.<br><br>Afterwards Squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals' minds at<br>rest. He assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade and<br>using money had never been passed, or even suggested. It was pure<br>imagination, probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by<br>Snowball. A few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but Squealer asked<br>them shrewdly, "Are you certain that this is not something that you have<br>dreamed, comrades? Have you any record of such a resolution? Is it written<br>down anywhere?" And since it was certainly true that nothing of the kind<br>existed in writing, the animals were satisfied that they had been mistaken.<br><br>Every Monday Mr. Whymper visited the farm as had been arranged. He was a<br>sly-looking little man with side whiskers, a solicitor in a very small way<br>of business, but sharp enough to have realised earlier than anyone else<br>that Animal Farm would need a broker and that the commissions would be<br>worth having. The animals watched his coming and going with a kind of<br>dread, and avoided him as much as possible. Nevertheless, the sight of<br>Napoleon, on all fours, delivering orders to Whymper, who stood on two<br>legs, roused their pride and partly reconciled them to the new<br>arrangement. Their relations with the human race were now not quite the<br>same as they had been before. The human beings did not hate Animal Farm<br>any less now that it was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever.<br>Every human being held it as an article of faith that the farm would go<br>bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a<br>failure. They would meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by<br>means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it<br>did stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will,<br>they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the<br>animals were managing their own affairs. One symptom of this was that they<br>had begun to call Animal Farm by its proper name and ceased to pretend<br>that it was called the Manor Farm. They had also dropped their championship<br>of Jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back and gone to live<br>in another part of the county. Except through Whymper, there was as yet no<br>contact between Animal Farm and the outside world, but there were constant<br>rumours that Napoleon was about to enter into a definite business agreement<br>either with Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood or with Mr. Frederick of<br>Pinchfield--but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously.<br><br>It was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and<br>took up their residence there. Again the animals seemed to remember that a<br>resolution against this had been passed in the early days, and again<br>Squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case. It was<br>absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were the brains of the<br>farm, should have a quiet place to work in. It was also more suited to the<br>dignity of the Leader (for of late he had taken to speaking of Napoleon<br>under the title of "Leader") to live in a house than in a mere sty.<br>Nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the<br>pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room<br>as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds. Boxer passed it off as<br>usual with "Napoleon is always right!", but Clover, who thought she<br>remembered a definite ruling against beds, went to the end of the barn and<br>tried to puzzle out the Seven Commandments which were inscribed there.<br>Finding herself unable to read more than individual letters, she fetched<br>Muriel.<br><br>"Muriel," she said, "read me the Fourth Commandment. Does it not say<br>something about never sleeping in a bed?"<br><br>With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out.<br><br>"It says, 'No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,"' she announced<br>finally.<br><br>Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered that the Fourth Commandment<br>mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so.<br>And Squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two<br>or three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective.<br><br>"You have heard then, comrades," he said, "that we pigs now sleep in the<br>beds of the farmhouse? And why not? You did not suppose, surely, that<br>there was ever a ruling against beds? A bed merely means a place to sleep<br>in. A pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded. The rule was<br>against sheets, which are a human invention. We have removed the sheets<br>from the farmhouse beds, and sleep between blankets. And very comfortable<br>beds they are too! But not more comfortable than we need, I can tell you,<br>comrades, with all the brainwork we have to do nowadays. You would not rob<br>us of our repose, would you, comrades? You would not have us too tired to<br>carry out our duties? Surely none of you wishes to see Jones back?"<br><br>The animals reassured him on this point immediately, and no more was said<br>about the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds. And when, some days<br>afterwards, it was announced that from now on the pigs would get up an<br>hour later in the mornings than the other animals, no complaint was made<br>about that either.<br><br>By the autumn the animals were tired but happy. They had had a hard year,<br>and after the sale of part of the hay and corn, the stores of food for the<br>winter were none too plentiful, but the windmill compensated for<br>everything. It was almost half built now. After the harvest there was a<br>stretch of clear dry weather, and the animals toiled harder than ever,<br>thinking it well worth while to plod to and fro all day with blocks of<br>stone if by doing so they could raise the walls another foot. Boxer would<br>even come out at nights and work for an hour or two on his own by the<br>light of the harvest moon. In their spare moments the animals would walk<br>round and round the half-finished mill, admiring the strength and<br>perpendicularity of its walls and marvelling that they should ever have<br>been able to build anything so imposing. Only old Benjamin refused to grow<br>enthusiastic about the windmill, though, as usual, he would utter nothing<br>beyond the cryptic remark that donkeys live a long time.<br><br>November came, with raging south-west winds. Building had to stop because<br>it was now too wet to mix the cement. Finally there came a night when the<br>gale was so violent that the farm buildings rocked on their foundations<br>and several tiles were blown off the roof of the barn. The hens woke up<br>squawking with terror because they had all dreamed simultaneously of<br>hearing a gun go off in the distance. In the morning the animals came out<br>of their stalls to find that the flagstaff had been blown down and an elm<br>tree at the foot of the orchard had been plucked up like a radish. They<br>had just noticed this when a cry of despair broke from every animal's<br>throat. A terrible sight had met their eyes. The windmill was in ruins.<br><br>With one accord they dashed down to the spot. Napoleon, who seldom moved<br>out of a walk, raced ahead of them all. Yes, there it lay, the fruit of<br>all their struggles, levelled to its foundations, the stones they had<br>broken and carried so laboriously scattered all around. Unable at first to<br>speak, they stood gazing mournfully at the litter of fallen stone. Napoleon<br>paced to and fro in silence, occasionally snuffing at the ground. His tail<br>had grown rigid and twitched sharply from side to side, a sign in him of<br>intense mental activity. Suddenly he halted as though his mind were<br>made up.<br><br>"Comrades," he said quietly, "do you know who is responsible for this? Do<br>you know the enemy who has come in the night and overthrown our windmill?<br>SNOWBALL!" he suddenly roared in a voice of thunder. "Snowball has done<br>this thing! In sheer malignity, thinking to set back our plans and avenge<br>himself for his ignominious expulsion, this traitor has crept here under<br>cover of night and destroyed our work of nearly a year. Comrades, here<br>and now I pronounce the death sentence upon Snowball. 'Animal Hero, Second<br>Class,' and half a bushel of apples to any animal who brings him to<br>justice. A full bushel to anyone who captures him alive!"<br><br>The animals were shocked beyond measure to learn that even Snowball could<br>be guilty of such an action. There was a cry of indignation, and everyone<br>began thinking out ways of catching Snowball if he should ever come back.<br>Almost immediately the footprints of a pig were discovered in the grass at<br>a little distance from the knoll. They could only be traced for a few<br>yards, but appeared to lead to a hole in the hedge. Napoleon snuffed<br>deeply at them and pronounced them to be Snowball's. He gave it as his<br>opinion that Snowball had probably come from the direction of Foxwood Farm.<br><br>"No more delays, comrades!" cried Napoleon when the footprints had been<br>examined. "There is work to be done. This very morning we begin rebuilding<br>the windmill, and we will build all through the winter, rain or shine. We<br>will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily.<br>Remember, comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall<br>be carried out to the day. Forward, comrades! Long live the windmill!
