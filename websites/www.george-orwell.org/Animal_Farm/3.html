<h2>Chapter IV</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>By the late summer the news of what had happened on Animal Farm had spread<br>across half the county. Every day Snowball and Napoleon sent out flights<br>of pigeons whose instructions were to mingle with the animals on<br>neighbouring farms, tell them the story of the Rebellion, and teach them<br>the tune of 'Beasts of England'.<br><br>Most of this time Mr. Jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the Red<br>Lion at Willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of the<br>monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property by<br>a pack of good-for-nothing animals. The other farmers sympathised in<br>principle, but they did not at first give him much help. At heart, each of<br>them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn Jones's<br>misfortune to his own advantage. It was lucky that the owners of the two<br>farms which adjoined Animal Farm were on permanently bad terms. One of<br>them, which was named Foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm,<br>much overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedges<br>in a disgraceful condition. Its owner, Mr. Pilkington, was an easy-going<br>gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting<br>according to the season. The other farm, which was called Pinchfield, was<br>smaller and better kept. Its owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough, shrewd<br>man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard<br>bargains. These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for<br>them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.<br><br>Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on<br>Animal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning<br>too much about it. At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of<br>animals managing a farm for themselves. The whole thing would be over in a<br>fortnight, they said. They put it about that the animals on the Manor Farm<br>(they insisted on calling it the Manor Farm; they would not tolerate the<br>name "Animal Farm") were perpetually fighting among themselves and were<br>also rapidly starving to death. When time passed and the animals had<br>evidently not starved to death, Frederick and Pilkington changed their<br>tune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished on<br>Animal Farm. It was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism,<br>tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in<br>common. This was what came of rebelling against the laws of Nature,<br>Frederick and Pilkington said.<br><br>However, these stories were never fully believed. Rumours of a wonderful<br>farm, where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managed<br>their own affairs, continued to circulate in vague and distorted forms,<br>and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the<br>countryside. Bulls which had always been tractable suddenly turned savage,<br>sheep broke down hedges and devoured the clover, cows kicked the pail<br>over, hunters refused their fences and shot their riders on to the other<br>side. Above all, the tune and even the words of 'Beasts of England' were<br>known everywhere. It had spread with astonishing speed. The human beings<br>could not contain their rage when they heard this song, though they<br>pretended to think it merely ridiculous. They could not understand, they<br>said, how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptible<br>rubbish. Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot.<br>And yet the song was irrepressible. The blackbirds whistled it in the<br>hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the<br>smithies and the tune of the church bells. And when the human beings<br>listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their<br>future doom.<br><br>Early in October, when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it was<br>already threshed, a flight of pigeons came whirling through the air and<br>alighted in the yard of Animal Farm in the wildest excitement. Jones and<br>all his men, with half a dozen others from Foxwood and Pinchfield, had<br>entered the five-barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that led to<br>the farm. They were all carrying sticks, except Jones, who was marching<br>ahead with a gun in his hands. Obviously they were going to attempt the<br>recapture of the farm.<br><br>This had long been expected, and all preparations had been made. Snowball,<br>who had studied an old book of Julius Caesar's campaigns which he had<br>found in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations. He gave<br>his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his<br>post.<br><br>As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched his<br>first attack. All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and<br>fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the<br>men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the<br>hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs.<br>However, this was only a light skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create a<br>little disorder, and the men easily drove the geese off with their sticks.<br>Snowball now launched his second line of attack. Muriel, Benjamin, and all<br>the sheep, with Snowball at the head of them, rushed forward and prodded<br>and butted the men from every side, while Benjamin turned around and<br>lashed at them with his small hoofs. But once again the men, with their<br>sticks and their hobnailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly,<br>at a squeal from Snowball, which was the signal for retreat, all the<br>animals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard.<br><br>The men gave a shout of triumph. They saw, as they imagined, their enemies<br>in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder. This was just what<br>Snowball had intended. As soon as they were well inside the yard, the<br>three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been lying<br>in ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them<br>off. Snowball now gave the signal for the charge. He himself dashed<br>straight for Jones. Jones saw him coming, raised his gun and fired. The<br>pellets scored bloody streaks along Snowball's back, and a sheep dropped<br>dead. Without halting for an instant, Snowball flung his fifteen stone<br>against Jones's legs. Jones was hurled into a pile of dung and his gun<br>flew out of his hands. But the most terrifying spectacle of all was Boxer,<br>rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shod<br>hoofs like a stallion. His very first blow took a stable-lad from Foxwood<br>on the skull and stretched him lifeless in the mud. At the sight, several<br>men dropped their sticks and tried to run. Panic overtook them, and the<br>next moment all the animals together were chasing them round and round the<br>yard. They were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on. There was not an<br>animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own<br>fashion. Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shoulders<br>and sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly. At a moment<br>when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the<br>yard and make a bolt for the main road. And so within five minutes of<br>their invasion they were in ignominious retreat by the same way as they<br>had come, with a flock of geese hissing after them and pecking at their<br>calves all the way.<br><br>All the men were gone except one. Back in the yard Boxer was pawing with<br>his hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to turn<br>him over. The boy did not stir.<br><br>"He is dead," said Boxer sorrowfully. "I had no intention of doing that.<br>I forgot that I was wearing iron shoes. Who will believe that I did not do<br>this on purpose?"<br><br>"No sentimentality, comrade!" cried Snowball from whose wounds the blood<br>was still dripping. "War is war. The only good human being is a dead one."<br><br>"I have no wish to take life, not even human life," repeated Boxer, and<br>his eyes were full of tears.<br><br>"Where is Mollie?" exclaimed somebody.<br><br>Mollie in fact was missing. For a moment there was great alarm; it was<br>feared that the men might have harmed her in some way, or even carried her<br>off with them. In the end, however, she was found hiding in her stall with<br>her head buried among the hay in the manger. She had taken to flight as<br>soon as the gun went off. And when the others came back from looking for<br>her, it was to find that the stable-lad, who in fact was only stunned, had<br>already recovered and made off.<br><br>The animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement, each recounting<br>his own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice. An impromptu<br>celebration of the victory was held immediately. The flag was run up and<br>'Beasts of England' was sung a number of times, then the sheep who had been<br>killed was given a solemn funeral, a hawthorn bush being planted on her<br>grave. At the graveside Snowball made a little speech, emphasising the<br>need for all animals to be ready to die for Animal Farm if need be.<br><br>The animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration, "Animal<br>Hero, First Class," which was conferred there and then on Snowball and<br>Boxer. It consisted of a brass medal (they were really some old<br>horse-brasses which had been found in the harness-room), to be worn on<br>Sundays and holidays. There was also "Animal Hero, Second Class," which<br>was conferred posthumously on the dead sheep.<br><br>There was much discussion as to what the battle should be called. In the<br>end, it was named the Battle of the Cowshed, since that was where the<br>ambush had been sprung. Mr. Jones's gun had been found lying in the mud,<br>and it was known that there was a supply of cartridges in the farmhouse.<br>It was decided to set the gun up at the foot of the Flagstaff, like a<br>piece of artillery, and to fire it twice a year--once on October the<br>twelfth, the anniversary of the Battle of the Cowshed, and once on<br>Midsummer Day, the anniversary of the Rebellion.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/2.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/4.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
