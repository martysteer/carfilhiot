<h2>Chapter V</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>As winter drew on, Mollie became more and more troublesome. She was late<br>for work every morning and excused herself by saying that she had<br>overslept, and she complained of mysterious pains, although her appetite<br>was excellent. On every kind of pretext she would run away from work and<br>go to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own<br>reflection in the water. But there were also rumours of something more<br>serious. One day, as Mollie strolled blithely into the yard, flirting her<br>long tail and chewing at a stalk of hay, Clover took her aside.<br><br>"Mollie," she said, "I have something very serious to say to you. This<br>morning I saw you looking over the hedge that divides Animal Farm from<br>Foxwood. One of Mr. Pilkington's men was standing on the other side of the<br>hedge. And--I was a long way away, but I am almost certain I saw this--he<br>was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose. What<br>does that mean, Mollie?"<br><br>"He didn't! I wasn't! It isn't true!" cried Mollie, beginning to prance<br>about and paw the ground.<br><br>"Mollie! Look me in the face. Do you give me your word of honour that that<br>man was not stroking your nose?"<br><br>"It isn't true!" repeated Mollie, but she could not look Clover in the<br>face, and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the<br>field.<br><br>A thought struck Clover. Without saying anything to the others, she went<br>to Mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. Hidden under<br>the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of<br>different colours.<br><br>Three days later Mollie disappeared. For some weeks nothing was known of<br>her whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on the<br>other side of Willingdon. She was between the shafts of a smart dogcart<br>painted red and black, which was standing outside a public-house. A fat<br>red-faced man in check breeches and gaiters, who looked like a publican,<br>was stroking her nose and feeding her with sugar. Her coat was newly<br>clipped and she wore a scarlet ribbon round her forelock. She appeared to<br>be enjoying herself, so the pigeons said. None of the animals ever<br>mentioned Mollie again.<br><br>In January there came bitterly hard weather. The earth was like iron, and<br>nothing could be done in the fields. Many meetings were held in the big<br>barn, and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the work of the<br>coming season. It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were<br>manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions of<br>farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote.<br>This arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not been for the<br>disputes between Snowball and Napoleon. These two disagreed at every point<br>where disagreement was possible. If one of them suggested sowing a bigger<br>acreage with barley, the other was certain to demand a bigger acreage of<br>oats, and if one of them said that such and such a field was just right<br>for cabbages, the other would declare that it was useless for anything<br>except roots. Each had his own following, and there were some violent<br>debates. At the Meetings Snowball often won over the majority by his<br>brilliant speeches, but Napoleon was better at canvassing support for<br>himself in between times. He was especially successful with the sheep. Of<br>late the sheep had taken to bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad" both<br>in and out of season, and they often interrupted the Meeting with this. It<br>was noticed that they were especially liable to break into "Four legs<br>good, two legs bad" at crucial moments in Snowball's speeches. Snowball<br>had made a close study of some back numbers of the 'Farmer and<br>Stockbreeder' which he had found in the farmhouse, and was full of plans<br>for innovations and improvements. He talked learnedly about field drains,<br>silage, and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated scheme for all<br>the animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different spot<br>every day, to save the labour of cartage. Napoleon produced no schemes of<br>his own, but said quietly that Snowball's would come to nothing, and<br>seemed to be biding his time. But of all their controversies, none was so<br>bitter as the one that took place over the windmill.<br><br>In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small<br>knoll which was the highest point on the farm. After surveying the ground,<br>Snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill, which could<br>be made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power.<br>This would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run a<br>circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, and an electric milking<br>machine. The animals had never heard of anything of this kind before<br>(for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitive<br>machinery), and they listened in astonishment while Snowball conjured up<br>pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while<br>they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with<br>reading and conversation.<br><br>Within a few weeks Snowball's plans for the windmill were fully worked<br>out. The mechanical details came mostly from three books which had<br>belonged to Mr. Jones--'One Thousand Useful Things to Do About the House',<br>'Every Man His Own Bricklayer', and 'Electricity for Beginners'. Snowball<br>used as his study a shed which had once been used for incubators and had a<br>smooth wooden floor, suitable for drawing on. He was closeted there for<br>hours at a time. With his books held open by a stone, and with a piece of<br>chalk gripped between the knuckles of his trotter, he would move rapidly<br>to and fro, drawing in line after line and uttering little whimpers of<br>excitement. Gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass of cranks and<br>cog-wheels, covering more than half the floor, which the other animals<br>found completely unintelligible but very impressive. All of them came to<br>look at Snowball's drawings at least once a day. Even the hens and ducks<br>came, and were at pains not to tread on the chalk marks. Only Napoleon<br>held aloof. He had declared himself against the windmill from the start.<br>One day, however, he arrived unexpectedly to examine the plans. He walked<br>heavily round the shed, looked closely at every detail of the plans and<br>snuffed at them once or twice, then stood for a little while contemplating<br>them out of the corner of his eye; then suddenly he lifted his leg,<br>urinated over the plans, and walked out without uttering a word.<br><br>The whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill. Snowball<br>did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business. Stone would<br>have to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails would have to<br>be made and after that there would be need for dynamos and cables. (How<br>these were to be procured, Snowball did not say.) But he maintained that<br>it could all be done in a year. And thereafter, he declared, so much<br>labour would be saved that the animals would only need to work three days<br>a week. Napoleon, on the other hand, argued that the great need of the<br>moment was to increase food production, and that if they wasted time on<br>the windmill they would all starve to death. The animals formed themselves<br>into two factions under the slogan, "Vote for Snowball and the three-day<br>week" and "Vote for Napoleon and the full manger." Benjamin was the only<br>animal who did not side with either faction. He refused to believe either<br>that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save<br>work. Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always<br>gone on--that is, badly.<br><br>Apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question of the<br>defence of the farm. It was fully realised that though the human beings<br>had been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed they might make another and<br>more determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate Mr. Jones.<br>They had all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeat<br>had spread across the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouring<br>farms more restive than ever. As usual, Snowball and Napoleon were in<br>disagreement. According to Napoleon, what the animals must do was to<br>procure firearms and train themselves in the use of them. According to<br>Snowball, they must send out more and more pigeons and stir up rebellion<br>among the animals on the other farms. The one argued that if they could<br>not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other argued<br>that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend<br>themselves. The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and<br>could not make up their minds which was right; indeed, they always found<br>themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment.<br><br>At last the day came when Snowball's plans were completed. At the Meeting<br>on the following Sunday the question of whether or not to begin work on<br>the windmill was to be put to the vote. When the animals had assembled in<br>the big barn, Snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted by<br>bleating from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the building<br>of the windmill. Then Napoleon stood up to reply. He said very quietly<br>that the windmill was nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it,<br>and promptly sat down again; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and<br>seemed almost indifferent as to the effect he produced. At this Snowball<br>sprang to his feet, and shouting down the sheep, who had begun bleating<br>again, broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill. Until now<br>the animals had been about equally divided in their sympathies, but in a<br>moment Snowball's eloquence had carried them away. In glowing sentences he<br>painted a picture of Animal Farm as it might be when sordid labour was<br>lifted from the animals' backs. His imagination had now run far beyond<br>chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers. Electricity, he said, could operate<br>threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders,<br>besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold<br>water, and an electric heater. By the time he had finished speaking, there<br>was no doubt as to which way the vote would go. But just at this moment<br>Napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at Snowball,<br>uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter<br>before.<br><br>At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogs<br>wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn. They dashed<br>straight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time to<br>escape their snapping jaws. In a moment he was out of the door and they<br>were after him. Too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animals<br>crowded through the door to watch the chase. Snowball was racing across<br>the long pasture that led to the road. He was running as only a pig can<br>run, but the dogs were close on his heels. Suddenly he slipped and it<br>seemed certain that they had him. Then he was up again, running faster<br>than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again. One of them all but<br>closed his jaws on Snowball's tail, but Snowball whisked it free just in<br>time. Then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few inches to spare,<br>slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more.<br><br>Silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn. In a moment<br>the dogs came bounding back. At first no one had been able to imagine<br>where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: they<br>were the puppies whom Napoleon had taken away from their mothers and<br>reared privately. Though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and as<br>fierce-looking as wolves. They kept close to Napoleon. It was noticed that<br>they wagged their tails to him in the same way as the other dogs had been<br>used to do to Mr. Jones.<br><br>Napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raised<br>portion of the floor where Major had previously stood to deliver his<br>speech. He announced that from now on the Sunday-morning Meetings would<br>come to an end. They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time. In future<br>all questions relating to the working of the farm would be settled by a<br>special committee of pigs, presided over by himself. These would meet in<br>private and afterwards communicate their decisions to the others. The<br>animals would still assemble on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing<br>'Beasts of England', and receive their orders for the week; but there would<br>be no more debates.<br><br>In spite of the shock that Snowball's expulsion had given them, the<br>animals were dismayed by this announcement. Several of them would have<br>protested if they could have found the right arguments. Even Boxer was<br>vaguely troubled. He set his ears back, shook his forelock several times,<br>and tried hard to marshal his thoughts; but in the end he could not think<br>of anything to say. Some of the pigs themselves, however, were more<br>articulate. Four young porkers in the front row uttered shrill squeals of<br>disapproval, and all four of them sprang to their feet and began speaking<br>at once. But suddenly the dogs sitting round Napoleon let out deep,<br>menacing growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat down again. Then the<br>sheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of "Four legs good, two legs<br>bad!" which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour and put an end to any<br>chance of discussion.<br><br>Afterwards Squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new arrangement<br>to the others.<br><br>"Comrades," he said, "I trust that every animal here appreciates the<br>sacrifice that Comrade Napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon<br>himself. Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! On the<br>contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility. No one believes more<br>firmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal. He would be only<br>too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. But sometimes you<br>might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be?<br>Suppose you had decided to follow Snowball, with his moonshine of<br>windmills--Snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal?"<br><br>"He fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed," said somebody.<br><br>"Bravery is not enough," said Squealer. "Loyalty and obedience are more<br>important. And as to the Battle of the Cowshed, I believe the time will<br>come when we shall find that Snowball's part in it was much exaggerated.<br>Discipline, comrades, iron discipline! That is the watchword for today.<br>One false step, and our enemies would be upon us. Surely, comrades, you do<br>not want Jones back?"<br><br>Once again this argument was unanswerable. Certainly the animals did not<br>want Jones back; if the holding of debates on Sunday mornings was liable<br>to bring him back, then the debates must stop. Boxer, who had now had time<br>to think things over, voiced the general feeling by saying: "If Comrade<br>Napoleon says it, it must be right." And from then on he adopted the<br>maxim, "Napoleon is always right," in addition to his private motto of "I<br>will work harder."<br><br>By this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing had begun.<br>The shed where Snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been shut<br>up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor. Every<br>Sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in the big barn to<br>receive their orders for the week. The skull of old Major, now clean of<br>flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the<br>foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun. After the hoisting of the flag, the<br>animals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner before<br>entering the barn. Nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done<br>in the past. Napoleon, with Squealer and another pig named Minimus, who<br>had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the front of<br>the raised platform, with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle round<br>them, and the other pigs sitting behind. The rest of the animals sat<br>facing them in the main body of the barn. Napoleon read out the orders for<br>the week in a gruff soldierly style, and after a single singing of 'Beasts<br>of England', all the animals dispersed.<br><br>On the third Sunday after Snowball's expulsion, the animals were somewhat<br>surprised to hear Napoleon announce that the windmill was to be built<br>after all. He did not give any reason for having changed his mind, but<br>merely warned the animals that this extra task would mean very hard work,<br>it might even be necessary to reduce their rations. The plans, however,<br>had all been prepared, down to the last detail. A special committee of<br>pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks. The building of<br>the windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take two<br>years.<br><br>That evening Squealer explained privately to the other animals that<br>Napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill. On the<br>contrary, it was he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the plan<br>which Snowball had drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actually<br>been stolen from among Napoleon's papers. The windmill was, in fact,<br>Napoleon's own creation. Why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken so<br>strongly against it? Here Squealer looked very sly. That, he said, was<br>Comrade Napoleon's cunning. He had SEEMED to oppose the windmill, simply<br>as a manoeuvre to get rid of Snowball, who was a dangerous character and a<br>bad influence. Now that Snowball was out of the way, the plan could go<br>forward without his interference. This, said Squealer, was something<br>called tactics. He repeated a number of times, "Tactics, comrades,<br>tactics!" skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh. The<br>animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke so<br>persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so<br>threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further<br>questions.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/3.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/5.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
