<h2>Chapter VII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>It was a bitter winter. The stormy weather was followed by sleet and snow,<br>and then by a hard frost which did not break till well into February. The<br>animals carried on as best they could with the rebuilding of the windmill,<br>well knowing that the outside world was watching them and that the envious<br>human beings would rejoice and triumph if the mill were not finished<br>on time.<br><br>Out of spite, the human beings pretended not to believe that it was<br>Snowball who had destroyer the windmill: they said that it had fallen down<br>because the walls were too thin. The animals knew that this was not the<br>case. Still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick this<br>time instead of eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting much<br>larger quantities of stone. For a long time the quarry was full of<br>snowdrifts and nothing could be done. Some progress was made in the dry<br>frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals could<br>not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before. They were always<br>cold, and usually hungry as well. Only Boxer and Clover never lost heart.<br>Squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of<br>labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in Boxer's strength<br>and his never-failing cry of "I will work harder!"<br><br>In January food fell short. The corn ration was drastically reduced, and<br>it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up<br>for it. Then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop<br>had been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough.<br>The potatoes had become soft and discoloured, and only a few were edible.<br>For days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and mangels.<br>Starvation seemed to stare them in the face.<br><br>It was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world.<br>Emboldened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings were<br>inventing fresh lies about Animal Farm. Once again it was being put about<br>that all the animals were dying of famine and disease, and that they were<br>continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to cannibalism and<br>infanticide. Napoleon was well aware of the bad results that might follow<br>if the real facts of the food situation were known, and he decided to make<br>use of Mr. Whymper to spread a contrary impression. Hitherto the animals<br>had had little or no contact with Whymper on his weekly visits: now,<br>however, a few selected animals, mostly sheep, were instructed to remark<br>casually in his hearing that rations had been increased. In addition,<br>Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled<br>nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained<br>of the grain and meal. On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through<br>the store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. He was<br>deceived, and continued to report to the outside world that there was no<br>food shortage on Animal Farm.<br><br>Nevertheless, towards the end of January it became obvious that it would<br>be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere. In these days<br>Napoleon rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time in the<br>farmhouse, which was guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs. When he<br>did emerge, it was in a ceremonial manner, with an escort of six dogs who<br>closely surrounded him and growled if anyone came too near. Frequently he<br>did not even appear on Sunday mornings, but issued his orders through one<br>of the other pigs, usually Squealer.<br><br>One Sunday morning Squealer announced that the hens, who had just come in<br>to lay again, must surrender their eggs. Napoleon had accepted, through<br>Whymper, a contract for four hundred eggs a week. The price of these would<br>pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going till summer came on<br>and conditions were easier.<br><br>When the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry. They had been<br>warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary, but had not<br>believed that it would really happen. They were just getting their<br>clutches ready for the spring sitting, and they protested that to take the<br>eggs away now was murder. For the first time since the expulsion of Jones,<br>there was something resembling a rebellion. Led by three young Black<br>Minorca pullets, the hens made a determined effort to thwart Napoleon's<br>wishes. Their method was to fly up to the rafters and there lay their<br>eggs, which smashed to pieces on the floor. Napoleon acted swiftly and<br>ruthlessly. He ordered the hens' rations to be stopped, and decreed that<br>any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be punished<br>by death. The dogs saw to it that these orders were carried out. For five<br>days the hens held out, then they capitulated and went back to their<br>nesting boxes. Nine hens had died in the meantime. Their bodies were<br>buried in the orchard, and it was given out that they had died of<br>coccidiosis. Whymper heard nothing of this affair, and the eggs were duly<br>delivered, a grocer's van driving up to the farm once a week to take them<br>away.<br><br>All this while no more had been seen of Snowball. He was rumoured to be<br>hiding on one of the neighbouring farms, either Foxwood or Pinchfield.<br>Napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the other farmers<br>than before. It happened that there was in the yard a pile of timber which<br>had been stacked there ten years earlier when a beech spinney was cleared.<br>It was well seasoned, and Whymper had advised Napoleon to sell it; both<br>Mr. Pilkington and Mr. Frederick were anxious to buy it. Napoleon was<br>hesitating between the two, unable to make up his mind. It was noticed<br>that whenever he seemed on the point of coming to an agreement with<br>Frederick, Snowball was declared to be in hiding at Foxwood, while, when<br>he inclined toward Pilkington, Snowball was said to be at Pinchfield.<br><br>Suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered. Snowball<br>was secretly frequenting the farm by night! The animals were so disturbed<br>that they could hardly sleep in their stalls. Every night, it was said, he<br>came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of<br>mischief. He stole the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs,<br>he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees. Whenever<br>anything went wrong it became usual to attribute it to Snowball. If a<br>window was broken or a drain was blocked up, someone was certain to say<br>that Snowball had come in the night and done it, and when the key of the<br>store-shed was lost, the whole farm was convinced that Snowball had thrown<br>it down the well. Curiously enough, they went on believing this even after<br>the mislaid key was found under a sack of meal. The cows declared<br>unanimously that Snowball crept into their stalls and milked them in their<br>sleep. The rats, which had been troublesome that winter, were also said to<br>be in league with Snowball.<br><br>Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into Snowball's<br>activities. With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour<br>of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a<br>respectful distance. At every few steps Napoleon stopped and snuffed the<br>ground for traces of Snowball's footsteps, which, he said, he could detect<br>by the smell. He snuffed in every corner, in the barn, in the cow-shed,<br>in the henhouses, in the vegetable garden, and found traces of Snowball<br>almost everywhere. He would put his snout to the ground, give several deep<br>sniffs, ad exclaim in a terrible voice, "Snowball! He has been here! I can<br>smell him distinctly!" and at the word "Snowball" all the dogs let out<br>blood-curdling growls and showed their side teeth.<br><br>The animals were thoroughly frightened. It seemed to them as though<br>Snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about<br>them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers. In the evening Squealer<br>called them together, and with an alarmed expression on his face told<br>them that he had some serious news to report.<br><br>"Comrades!" cried Squealer, making little nervous skips, "a most terrible<br>thing has been discovered. Snowball has sold himself to Frederick of<br>Pinchfield Farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and take our farm<br>away from us! Snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins. But<br>there is worse than that. We had thought that Snowball's rebellion was<br>caused simply by his vanity and ambition. But we were wrong, comrades. Do<br>you know what the real reason was? Snowball was in league with Jones from<br>the very start! He was Jones's secret agent all the time. It has all been<br>proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just<br>discovered. To my mind this explains a great deal, comrades. Did we not<br>see for ourselves how he attempted--fortunately without success--to get us<br>defeated and destroyed at the Battle of the Cowshed?"<br><br>The animals were stupefied. This was a wickedness far outdoing Snowball's<br>destruction of the windmill. But it was some minutes before they could<br>fully take it in. They all remembered, or thought they remembered, how<br>they had seen Snowball charging ahead of them at the Battle of the<br>Cowshed, how he had rallied and encouraged them at every turn, and how he<br>had not paused for an instant even when the pellets from Jones's gun had<br>wounded his back. At first it was a little difficult to see how this<br>fitted in with his being on Jones's side. Even Boxer, who seldom asked<br>questions, was puzzled. He lay down, tucked his fore hoofs beneath him,<br>shut his eyes, and with a hard effort managed to formulate his thoughts.<br><br>"I do not believe that," he said. "Snowball fought bravely at the Battle<br>of the Cowshed. I saw him myself. Did we not give him 'Animal Hero, first<br>Class,' immediately afterwards?"<br><br>"That was our mistake, comrade. For we know now--it is all written down in<br>the secret documents that we have found--that in reality he was trying to<br>lure us to our doom."<br><br>"But he was wounded," said Boxer. "We all saw him running with blood."<br><br>"That was part of the arrangement!" cried Squealer. "Jones's shot only<br>grazed him. I could show you this in his own writing, if you were able to<br>read it. The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the<br>signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. And he very nearly<br>succeeded--I will even say, comrades, he WOULD have succeeded if it had<br>not been for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon. Do you not remember how,<br>just at the moment when Jones and his men had got inside the yard,<br>Snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many animals followed him? And do<br>you not remember, too, that it was just at that moment, when panic was<br>spreading and all seemed lost, that Comrade Napoleon sprang forward with a<br>cry of 'Death to Humanity!' and sank his teeth in Jones's leg? Surely you<br>remember THAT, comrades?" exclaimed Squealer, frisking from side to side.<br><br>Now when Squealer described the scene so graphically, it seemed to the<br>animals that they did remember it. At any rate, they remembered that at<br>the critical moment of the battle Snowball had turned to flee. But Boxer<br>was still a little uneasy.<br><br>"I do not believe that Snowball was a traitor at the beginning," he said<br>finally. "What he has done since is different. But I believe that at the<br>Battle of the Cowshed he was a good comrade."<br><br>"Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," announced Squealer, speaking very slowly<br>and firmly, "has stated categorically--categorically, comrade--that<br>Snowball was Jones's agent from the very beginning--yes, and from long<br>before the Rebellion was ever thought of."<br><br>"Ah, that is different!" said Boxer. "If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must<br>be right."<br><br>"That is the true spirit, comrade!" cried Squealer, but it was noticed he<br>cast a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling eyes. He turned<br>to go, then paused and added impressively: "I warn every animal on this<br>farm to keep his eyes very wide open. For we have reason to think that<br>some of Snowball's secret agents are lurking among us at this moment!"<br><br>Four days later, in the late afternoon, Napoleon ordered all the animals<br>to assemble in the yard. When they were all gathered together, Napoleon<br>emerged from the farmhouse, wearing both his medals (for he had recently<br>awarded himself "Animal Hero, First Class", and "Animal Hero, Second<br>Class"), with his nine huge dogs frisking round him and uttering growls<br>that sent shivers down all the animals' spines. They all cowered silently<br>in their places, seeming to know in advance that some terrible thing was<br>about to happen.<br><br>Napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience; then he uttered a<br>high-pitched whimper. Immediately the dogs bounded forward, seized four of<br>the pigs by the ear and dragged them, squealing with pain and terror, to<br>Napoleon's feet. The pigs' ears were bleeding, the dogs had tasted blood,<br>and for a few moments they appeared to go quite mad. To the amazement of<br>everybody, three of them flung themselves upon Boxer. Boxer saw them<br>coming and put out his great hoof, caught a dog in mid-air, and pinned<br>him to the ground. The dog shrieked for mercy and the other two fled with<br>their tails between their legs. Boxer looked at Napoleon to know whether<br>he should crush the dog to death or let it go. Napoleon appeared to change<br>countenance, and sharply ordered Boxer to let the dog go, whereat Boxer<br>lifted his hoof, and the dog slunk away, bruised and howling.<br><br>Presently the tumult died down. The four pigs waited, trembling, with<br>guilt written on every line of their countenances. Napoleon now called<br>upon them to confess their crimes. They were the same four pigs as had<br>protested when Napoleon abolished the Sunday Meetings. Without any further<br>prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch with<br>Snowball ever since his expulsion, that they had collaborated with him in<br>destroying the windmill, and that they had entered into an agreement with<br>him to hand over Animal Farm to Mr. Frederick. They added that Snowball<br>had privately admitted to them that he had been Jones's secret agent for<br>years past. When they had finished their confession, the dogs promptly<br>tore their throats out, and in a terrible voice Napoleon demanded whether<br>any other animal had anything to confess.<br><br>The three hens who had been the ringleaders in the attempted rebellion<br>over the eggs now came forward and stated that Snowball had appeared to<br>them in a dream and incited them to disobey Napoleon's orders. They, too,<br>were slaughtered. Then a goose came forward and confessed to having<br>secreted six ears of corn during the last year's harvest and eaten them in<br>the night. Then a sheep confessed to having urinated in the drinking<br>pool--urged to do this, so she said, by Snowball--and two other sheep<br>confessed to having murdered an old ram, an especially devoted follower of<br>Napoleon, by chasing him round and round a bonfire when he was suffering<br>from a cough. They were all slain on the spot. And so the tale of<br>confessions and executions went on, until there was a pile of corpses<br>lying before Napoleon's feet and the air was heavy with the smell of<br>blood, which had been unknown there since the expulsion of Jones.<br><br>When it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs and dogs,<br>crept away in a body. They were shaken and miserable. They did not know<br>which was more shocking--the treachery of the animals who had leagued<br>themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just<br>witnessed. In the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed<br>equally terrible, but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now<br>that it was happening among themselves. Since Jones had left the farm,<br>until today, no animal had killed another animal. Not even a rat had been<br>killed. They had made their way on to the little knoll where the<br>half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as<br>though huddling together for warmth--Clover, Muriel, Benjamin, the cows,<br>the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens--everyone, indeed, except<br>the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon ordered the<br>animals to assemble. For some time nobody spoke. Only Boxer remained on<br>his feet. He fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against his<br>sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise. Finally he<br>said:<br><br>"I do not understand it. I would not have believed that such things could<br>happen on our farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves. The<br>solution, as I see it, is to work harder. From now onwards I shall get up<br>a full hour earlier in the mornings."<br><br>And he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry. Having got<br>there, he collected two successive loads of stone and dragged them down to<br>the windmill before retiring for the night.<br><br>The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking. The knoll where they were<br>lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. Most of Animal<br>Farm was within their view--the long pasture stretching down to the main<br>road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields<br>where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm<br>buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys. It was a clear spring<br>evening. The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays<br>of the sun. Never had the farm--and with a kind of surprise they<br>remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own<br>property--appeared to the animals so desirable a place. As Clover looked<br>down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. If she could have spoken her<br>thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed<br>at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the<br>human race. These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had<br>looked forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to<br>rebellion. If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been<br>of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each<br>working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she<br>had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of<br>Major's speech. Instead--she did not know why--they had come to a time<br>when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed<br>everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after<br>confessing to shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or<br>disobedience in her mind. She knew that, even as things were, they were<br>far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before<br>all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings.<br>Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the<br>orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon. But<br>still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped<br>and toiled. It was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced<br>the bullets of Jones's gun. Such were her thoughts, though she lacked the<br>words to express them.<br><br>At last, feeling this to be in some way a substitute for the words she was<br>unable to find, she began to sing 'Beasts of England'. The other animals<br>sitting round her took it up, and they sang it three times over--very<br>tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had never sung it<br>before.<br><br>They had just finished singing it for the third time when Squealer,<br>attended by two dogs, approached them with the air of having something<br>important to say. He announced that, by a special decree of Comrade<br>Napoleon, 'Beasts of England' had been abolished. From now onwards it was<br>forbidden to sing it.<br><br>The animals were taken aback.<br><br>"Why?" cried Muriel.<br><br>"It's no longer needed, comrade," said Squealer stiffly. "'Beasts of<br>England' was the song of the Rebellion. But the Rebellion is now<br>completed. The execution of the traitors this afternoon was the final act.<br>The enemy both external and internal has been defeated. In 'Beasts of<br>England' we expressed our longing for a better society in days to come.<br>But that society has now been established. Clearly this song has no longer<br>any purpose."<br><br>Frightened though they were, some of the animals might possibly have<br>protested, but at this moment the sheep set up their usual bleating of<br>"Four legs good, two legs bad," which went on for several minutes and put<br>an end to the discussion.<br><br>So 'Beasts of England' was heard no more. In its place Minimus, the poet,<br>had composed another song which began:<br><br><br>Animal Farm, Animal Farm,<br>Never through me shalt thou come to harm!<br><br><br>and this was sung every Sunday morning after the hoisting of the flag.<br>But somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the animals to<br>come up to 'Beasts of England'.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/5.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/7.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
