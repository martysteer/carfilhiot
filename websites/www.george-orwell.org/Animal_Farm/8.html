<h2>Chapter IX</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>Boxer's split hoof was a long time in healing. They had started the<br>rebuilding of the windmill the day after the victory celebrations were<br>ended. Boxer refused to take even a day off work, and made it a point of<br>honour not to let it be seen that he was in pain. In the evenings he would<br>admit privately to Clover that the hoof troubled him a great deal. Clover<br>treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by chewing<br>them, and both she and Benjamin urged Boxer to work less hard. "A horse's<br>lungs do not last for ever," she said to him. But Boxer would not listen.<br>He had, he said, only one real ambition left--to see the windmill well<br>under way before he reached the age for retirement.<br><br>At the beginning, when the laws of Animal Farm were first formulated,<br>the retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve, for cows at<br>fourteen, for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and geese at<br>five. Liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon. As yet no animal had<br>actually retired on pension, but of late the subject had been discussed<br>more and more. Now that the small field beyond the orchard had been set<br>aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner of the large pasture was<br>to be fenced off and turned into a grazing-ground for superannuated<br>animals. For a horse, it was said, the pension would be five pounds of<br>corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a carrot or<br>possibly an apple on public holidays. Boxer's twelfth birthday was due in<br>the late summer of the following year.<br><br>Meanwhile life was hard. The winter was as cold as the last one had been,<br>and food was even shorter. Once again all rations were reduced, except<br>those of the pigs and the dogs. A too rigid equality in rations, Squealer<br>explained, would have been contrary to the principles of Animalism. In any<br>case he had no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they were<br>NOT in reality short of food, whatever the appearances might be. For the<br>time being, certainly, it had been found necessary to make a readjustment<br>of rations (Squealer always spoke of it as a "readjustment," never as a<br>"reduction"), but in comparison with the days of Jones, the improvement<br>was enormous. Reading out the figures in a shrill, rapid voice, he proved<br>to them in detail that they had more oats, more hay, more turnips than<br>they had had in Jones's day, that they worked shorter hours, that their<br>drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer, that a<br>larger proportion of their young ones survived infancy, and that they had<br>more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas. The animals<br>believed every word of it. Truth to tell, Jones and all he stood for had<br>almost faded out of their memories. They knew that life nowadays was harsh<br>and bare, that they were often hungry and often cold, and that they were<br>usually working when they were not asleep. But doubtless it had been worse<br>in the old days. They were glad to believe so. Besides, in those days they<br>had been slaves and now they were free, and that made all the difference,<br>as Squealer did not fail to point out.<br><br>There were many more mouths to feed now. In the autumn the four sows had<br>all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between<br>them. The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was the only boar on<br>the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage. It was announced<br>that later, when bricks and timber had been purchased, a schoolroom would<br>be built in the farmhouse garden. For the time being, the young pigs were<br>given their instruction by Napoleon himself in the farmhouse kitchen. They<br>took their exercise in the garden, and were discouraged from playing with<br>the other young animals. About this time, too, it was laid down as a rule<br>that when a pig and any other animal met on the path, the other animal<br>must stand aside: and also that all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have<br>the privilege of wearing green ribbons on their tails on Sundays.<br><br>The farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of money.<br>There were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be purchased,<br>and it would also be necessary to begin saving up again for the machinery<br>for the windmill. Then there were lamp oil and candles for the house,<br>sugar for Napoleon's own table (he forbade this to the other pigs, on the<br>ground that it made them fat), and all the usual replacements such as<br>tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog biscuits. A stump of<br>hay and part of the potato crop were sold off, and the contract for eggs<br>was increased to six hundred a week, so that that year the hens barely<br>hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the same level. Rations,<br>reduced in December, were reduced again in February, and lanterns in the<br>stalls were forbidden to save oil. But the pigs seemed comfortable enough,<br>and in fact were putting on weight if anything. One afternoon in late<br>February a warm, rich, appetising scent, such as the animals had never<br>smelt before, wafted itself across the yard from the little brew-house,<br>which had been disused in Jones's time, and which stood beyond the<br>kitchen. Someone said it was the smell of cooking barley. The animals<br>sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being<br>prepared for their supper. But no warm mash appeared, and on the following<br>Sunday it was announced that from now onwards all barley would be reserved<br>for the pigs. The field beyond the orchard had already been sown with<br>barley. And the news soon leaked out that every pig was now receiving a<br>ration of a pint of beer daily, with half a gallon for Napoleon himself,<br>which was always served to him in the Crown Derby soup tureen.<br><br>But if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by the<br>fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before.<br>There were more songs, more speeches, more processions. Napoleon had<br>commanded that once a week there should be held something called a<br>Spontaneous Demonstration, the object of which was to celebrate the<br>struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm. At the appointed time the animals<br>would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in<br>military formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses, then the cows,<br>then the sheep, and then the poultry. The dogs flanked the procession and<br>at the head of all marched Napoleon's black cockerel. Boxer and Clover<br>always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof and the<br>horn and the caption, "Long live Comrade Napoleon!" Afterwards there were<br>recitations of poems composed in Napoleon's honour, and a speech by<br>Squealer giving particulars of the latest increases in the production of<br>foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was fired from the gun. The sheep were<br>the greatest devotees of the Spontaneous Demonstration, and if anyone<br>complained (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near)<br>that they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the<br>sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of "Four legs<br>good, two legs bad!" But by and large the animals enjoyed these<br>celebrations. They found it comforting to be reminded that, after all,<br>they were truly their own masters and that the work they did was for their<br>own benefit. So that, what with the songs, the processions, Squealer's<br>lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the cockerel,<br>and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their<br>bellies were empty, at least part of the time.<br><br>In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became necessary<br>to elect a President. There was only one candidate, Napoleon, who was<br>elected unanimously. On the same day it was given out that fresh documents<br>had been discovered which revealed further details about Snowball's<br>complicity with Jones. It now appeared that Snowball had not, as the<br>animals had previously imagined, merely attempted to lose the Battle of<br>the Cowshed by means of a stratagem, but had been openly fighting on<br>Jones's side. In fact, it was he who had actually been the leader of the<br>human forces, and had charged into battle with the words "Long live<br>Humanity!" on his lips. The wounds on Snowball's back, which a few of the<br>animals still remembered to have seen, had been inflicted by Napoleon's<br>teeth.<br><br>In the middle of the summer Moses the raven suddenly reappeared on the<br>farm, after an absence of several years. He was quite unchanged, still did<br>no work, and talked in the same strain as ever about Sugarcandy Mountain.<br>He would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, and talk by the hour to<br>anyone who would listen. "Up there, comrades," he would say solemnly,<br>pointing to the sky with his large beak--"up there, just on the other side<br>of that dark cloud that you can see--there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain,<br>that happy country where we poor animals shall rest for ever from our<br>labours!" He even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights,<br>and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and<br>lump sugar growing on the hedges. Many of the animals believed him. Their<br>lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and<br>just that a better world should exist somewhere else? A thing that was<br>difficult to determine was the attitude of the pigs towards Moses. They<br>all declared contemptuously that his stories about Sugarcandy Mountain<br>were lies, and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working,<br>with an allowance of a gill of beer a day.<br><br>After his hoof had healed up, Boxer worked harder than ever. Indeed, all<br>the animals worked like slaves that year. Apart from the regular work of<br>the farm, and the rebuilding of the windmill, there was the schoolhouse<br>for the young pigs, which was started in March. Sometimes the long hours<br>on insufficient food were hard to bear, but Boxer never faltered. In<br>nothing that he said or did was there any sign that his strength was not<br>what it had been. It was only his appearance that was a little altered;<br>his hide was less shiny than it had used to be, and his great haunches<br>seemed to have shrunken. The others said, "Boxer will pick up when the<br>spring grass comes on"; but the spring came and Boxer grew no fatter.<br>Sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry, when he braced<br>his muscles against the weight of some vast boulder, it seemed that<br>nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue. At such times<br>his lips were seen to form the words, "I will work harder"; he had no<br>voice left. Once again Clover and Benjamin warned him to take care of his<br>health, but Boxer paid no attention. His twelfth birthday was approaching.<br>He did not care what happened so long as a good store of stone was<br>accumulated before he went on pension.<br><br>Late one evening in the summer, a sudden rumour ran round the farm that<br>something had happened to Boxer. He had gone out alone to drag a load of<br>stone down to the windmill. And sure enough, the rumour was true. A few<br>minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news; "Boxer has fallen!<br>He is lying on his side and can't get up!"<br><br>About half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where the<br>windmill stood. There lay Boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his neck<br>stretched out, unable even to raise his head. His eyes were glazed, his<br>sides matted with sweat. A thin stream of blood had trickled out of his<br>mouth. Clover dropped to her knees at his side.<br><br>"Boxer!" she cried, "how are you?"<br><br>"It is my lung," said Boxer in a weak voice. "It does not matter. I think<br>you will be able to finish the windmill without me. There is a pretty good<br>store of stone accumulated. I had only another month to go in any case.<br>To tell you the truth, I had been looking forward to my retirement. And<br>perhaps, as Benjamin is growing old too, they will let him retire at the<br>same time and be a companion to me."<br><br>"We must get help at once," said Clover. "Run, somebody, and tell Squealer<br>what has happened."<br><br>All the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse to give<br>Squealer the news. Only Clover remained, and Benjamin who lay down at<br>Boxer's side, and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with his long<br>tail. After about a quarter of an hour Squealer appeared, full of sympathy<br>and concern. He said that Comrade Napoleon had learned with the very<br>deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most loyal workers on<br>the farm, and was already making arrangements to send Boxer to be treated<br>in the hospital at Willingdon. The animals felt a little uneasy at this.<br>Except for Mollie and Snowball, no other animal had ever left the farm,<br>and they did not like to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human<br>beings. However, Squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary<br>surgeon in Willingdon could treat Boxer's case more satisfactorily than<br>could be done on the farm. And about half an hour later, when Boxer had<br>somewhat recovered, he was with difficulty got on to his feet, and managed<br>to limp back to his stall, where Clover and Benjamin had prepared a good<br>bed of straw for him.<br><br>For the next two days Boxer remained in his stall. The pigs had sent out a<br>large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine chest<br>in the bathroom, and Clover administered it to Boxer twice a day after<br>meals. In the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him, while<br>Benjamin kept the flies off him. Boxer professed not to be sorry for what<br>had happened. If he made a good recovery, he might expect to live another<br>three years, and he looked forward to the peaceful days that he would<br>spend in the corner of the big pasture. It would be the first time that he<br>had had leisure to study and improve his mind. He intended, he said, to<br>devote the rest of his life to learning the remaining twenty-two letters<br>of the alphabet.<br><br>However, Benjamin and Clover could only be with Boxer after working hours,<br>and it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away.<br>The animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a<br>pig, when they were astonished to see Benjamin come galloping from the<br>direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice. It was<br>the first time that they had ever seen Benjamin excited--indeed, it was<br>the first time that anyone had ever seen him gallop. "Quick, quick!" he<br>shouted. "Come at once! They're taking Boxer away!" Without waiting for<br>orders from the pig, the animals broke off work and raced back to the farm<br>buildings. Sure enough, there in the yard was a large closed van, drawn by<br>two horses, with lettering on its side and a sly-looking man in a<br>low-crowned bowler hat sitting on the driver's seat. And Boxer's stall was<br>empty.<br><br>The animals crowded round the van. "Good-bye, Boxer!" they chorused,<br>"good-bye!"<br><br>"Fools! Fools!" shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping the<br>earth with his small hoofs. "Fools! Do you not see what is written on the<br>side of that van?"<br><br>That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. Muriel began to spell<br>out the words. But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly<br>silence he read:<br><br>"'Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer<br>in Hides and Bone-Meal. Kennels Supplied.' Do you not understand what that<br>means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!"<br><br>A cry of horror burst from all the animals. At this moment the man on the<br>box whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a smart<br>trot. All the animals followed, crying out at the tops of their voices.<br>Clover forced her way to the front. The van began to gather speed. Clover<br>tried to stir her stout limbs to a gallop, and achieved a canter. "Boxer!"<br>she cried. "Boxer! Boxer! Boxer!" And just at this moment, as though he<br>had heard the uproar outside, Boxer's face, with the white stripe down his<br>nose, appeared at the small window at the back of the van.<br><br>"Boxer!" cried Clover in a terrible voice. "Boxer! Get out! Get out<br>quickly! They're taking you to your death!"<br><br>All the animals took up the cry of "Get out, Boxer, get out!" But the van<br>was already gathering speed and drawing away from them. It was uncertain<br>whether Boxer had understood what Clover had said. But a moment later his<br>face disappeared from the window and there was the sound of a tremendous<br>drumming of hoofs inside the van. He was trying to kick his way out. The<br>time had been when a few kicks from Boxer's hoofs would have smashed the<br>van to matchwood. But alas! his strength had left him; and in a few<br>moments the sound of drumming hoofs grew fainter and died away. In<br>desperation the animals began appealing to the two horses which drew the<br>van to stop. "Comrades, comrades!" they shouted. "Don't take your own<br>brother to his death! "But the stupid brutes, too ignorant to realise<br>what was happening, merely set back their ears and quickened their pace.<br>Boxer's face did not reappear at the window. Too late, someone thought of<br>racing ahead and shutting the five-barred gate; but in another moment the<br>van was through it and rapidly disappearing down the road. Boxer was never<br>seen again.<br><br>Three days later it was announced that he had died in the hospital at<br>Willingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have.<br>Squealer came to announce the news to the others. He had, he said, been<br>present during Boxer's last hours.<br><br>"It was the most affecting sight I have ever seen!" said Squealer, lifting<br>his trotter and wiping away a tear. "I was at his bedside at the very<br>last. And at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear<br>that his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was<br>finished. 'Forward, comrades!' he whispered. 'Forward in the name of the<br>Rebellion. Long live Animal Farm! Long live Comrade Napoleon! Napoleon is<br>always right.' Those were his very last words, comrades."<br><br>Here Squealer's demeanour suddenly changed. He fell silent for a moment,<br>and his little eyes darted suspicious glances from side to side before he<br>proceeded.<br><br>It had come to his knowledge, he said, that a foolish and wicked rumour<br>had been circulated at the time of Boxer's removal. Some of the animals<br>had noticed that the van which took Boxer away was marked "Horse<br>Slaughterer," and had actually jumped to the conclusion that Boxer was<br>being sent to the knacker's. It was almost unbelievable, said Squealer,<br>that any animal could be so stupid. Surely, he cried indignantly, whisking<br>his tail and skipping from side to side, surely they knew their beloved<br>Leader, Comrade Napoleon, better than that? But the explanation was really<br>very simple. The van had previously been the property of the knacker, and<br>had been bought by the veterinary surgeon, who had not yet painted the old<br>name out. That was how the mistake had arisen.<br><br>The animals were enormously relieved to hear this. And when Squealer went<br>on to give further graphic details of Boxer's death-bed, the admirable<br>care he had received, and the expensive medicines for which Napoleon had<br>paid without a thought as to the cost, their last doubts disappeared and<br>the sorrow that they felt for their comrade's death was tempered by the<br>thought that at least he had died happy.<br><br>Napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following Sunday morning<br>and pronounced a short oration in Boxer's honour. It had not been<br>possible, he said, to bring back their lamented comrade's remains for<br>interment on the farm, but he had ordered a large wreath to be made from<br>the laurels in the farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on Boxer's<br>grave. And in a few days' time the pigs intended to hold a memorial<br>banquet in Boxer's honour. Napoleon ended his speech with a reminder of<br>Boxer's two favourite maxims, "I will work harder" and "Comrade Napoleon<br>is always right"--maxims, he said, which every animal would do well to<br>adopt as his own.<br><br>On the day appointed for the banquet, a grocer's van drove up from<br>Willingdon and delivered a large wooden crate at the farmhouse. That night<br>there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what<br>sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock with a<br>tremendous crash of glass. No one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on<br>the following day, and the word went round that from somewhere or other<br>the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/7.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/9.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
