<h2>Chapter III</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>How they toiled and sweated to get the hay in! But their efforts were<br>rewarded, for the harvest was an even bigger success than they had hoped.<br><br>Sometimes the work was hard; the implements had been designed for human<br>beings and not for animals, and it was a great drawback that no animal was<br>able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs. But the pigs<br>were so clever that they could think of a way round every difficulty. As<br>for the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in fact understood<br>the business of mowing and raking far better than Jones and his men had<br>ever done. The pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the<br>others. With their superior knowledge it was natural that they should<br>assume the leadership. Boxer and Clover would harness themselves to the<br>cutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins were needed in these days, of<br>course) and tramp steadily round and round the field with a pig walking<br>behind and calling out "Gee up, comrade!" or "Whoa back, comrade!" as the<br>case might be. And every animal down to the humblest worked at turning the<br>hay and gathering it. Even the ducks and hens toiled to and fro all day in<br>the sun, carrying tiny wisps of hay in their beaks. In the end they<br>finished the harvest in two days' less time than it had usually taken<br>Jones and his men. Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had<br>ever seen. There was no wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with their<br>sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk. And not an animal on the<br>farm had stolen so much as a mouthful.<br><br>All through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork. The<br>animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be. Every<br>mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly<br>their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out<br>to them by a grudging master. With the worthless parasitical human beings<br>gone, there was more for everyone to eat. There was more leisure too,<br>inexperienced though the animals were. They met with many difficulties--for<br>instance, later in the year, when they harvested the corn, they had to<br>tread it out in the ancient style and blow away the chaff with their<br>breath, since the farm possessed no threshing machine--but the pigs with<br>their cleverness and Boxer with his tremendous muscles always pulled them<br>through. Boxer was the admiration of everybody. He had been a hard worker<br>even in Jones's time, but now he seemed more like three horses than one;<br>there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on his<br>mighty shoulders. From morning to night he was pushing and pulling, always<br>at the spot where the work was hardest. He had made an arrangement with<br>one of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour earlier than<br>anyone else, and would put in some volunteer labour at whatever seemed to<br>be most needed, before the regular day's work began. His answer to every<br>problem, every setback, was "I will work <B style="color:black;background-color:#66FFCC">harder</B> "--which he had adopted as<br>his personal motto.<br><br>But everyone worked according to his capacity The hens and ducks, for<br>instance, saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up the<br>stray grains. Nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, the<br>quarrelling and biting and jealousy which had been normal features of life<br>in the old days had almost disappeared. Nobody shirked--or almost nobody.<br>Mollie, it was true, was not good at getting up in the mornings, and had a<br>way of leaving work early on the ground that there was a stone in her<br>hoof. And the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar. It was soon<br>noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found.<br>She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or in<br>the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened. But she<br>always made such excellent excuses, and purred so affectionately, that it<br>was impossible not to believe in her good intentions. Old Benjamin, the<br>donkey, seemed quite unchanged since the Rebellion. He did his work in the<br>same slow obstinate way as he had done it in Jones's time, never shirking<br>and never volunteering for extra work either. About the Rebellion and its<br>results he would express no opinion. When asked whether he was not happier<br>now that Jones was gone, he would say only "Donkeys live a long time. None<br>of you has ever seen a dead donkey," and the others had to be content with<br>this cryptic answer.<br><br>On Sundays there was no work. Breakfast was an hour later than usual, and<br>after breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every week without<br>fail. First came the hoisting of the flag. Snowball had found in the<br>harness-room an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones's and had painted on it<br>a hoof and a horn in white. This was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse<br>garden every Sunday morning. The flag was green, Snowball explained, to<br>represent the green fields of England, while the hoof and horn signified<br>the future Republic of the Animals which would arise when the human race<br>had been finally overthrown. After the hoisting of the flag all the<br>animals trooped into the big barn for a general assembly which was known<br>as the Meeting. Here the work of the coming week was planned out and<br>resolutions were put forward and debated. It was always the pigs who put<br>forward the resolutions. The other animals understood how to vote, but<br>could never think of any resolutions of their own. Snowball and Napoleon<br>were by far the most active in the debates. But it was noticed that these<br>two were never in agreement: whatever suggestion either of them made, the<br>other could be counted on to oppose it. Even when it was resolved--a thing<br>no one could object to in itself--to set aside the small paddock behind<br>the orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work, there was a<br>stormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal. The<br>Meeting always ended with the singing of 'Beasts of England', and the<br>afternoon was given up to recreation.<br><br>The pigs had set aside the harness-room as a headquarters for themselves.<br>Here, in the evenings, they studied blacksmithing, carpentering, and other<br>necessary arts from books which they had brought out of the farmhouse.<br>Snowball also busied himself with organising the other animals into what<br>he called Animal Committees. He was indefatigable at this. He formed the<br>Egg Production Committee for the hens, the Clean Tails League for the<br>cows, the Wild Comrades' Re-education Committee (the object of this was to<br>tame the rats and rabbits), the Whiter Wool Movement for the sheep, and<br>various others, besides instituting classes in reading and writing. On the<br>whole, these projects were a failure. The attempt to tame the wild<br>creatures, for instance, broke down almost immediately. They continued to<br>behave very much as before, and when treated with generosity, simply took<br>advantage of it. The cat joined the Re-education Committee and was very<br>active in it for some days. She was seen one day sitting on a roof and<br>talking to some sparrows who were just out of her reach. She was telling<br>them that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow who chose<br>could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept their distance.<br><br>The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success. By the<br>autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree.<br><br>As for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly. The dogs<br>learned to read fairly well, but were not interested in reading anything<br>except the Seven Commandments. Muriel, the goat, could read somewhat<br>better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in the<br>evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap.<br>Benjamin could read as well as any pig, but never exercised his faculty.<br>So far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading. Clover learnt<br>the whole alphabet, but could not put words together. Boxer could not get<br>beyond the letter D. He would trace out A, B, C, D, in the dust with his<br>great hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his ears<br>back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might to<br>remember what came next and never succeeding. On several occasions,<br>indeed, he did learn E, F, G, H, but by the time he knew them, it was<br>always discovered that he had forgotten A, B, C, and D. Finally he decided<br>to be content with the first four letters, and used to write them out once<br>or twice every day to refresh his memory. Mollie refused to learn any but<br>the six letters which spelt her own name. She would form these very neatly<br>out of pieces of twig, and would then decorate them with a flower or two<br>and walk round them admiring them.<br><br>None of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter A.<br>It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, and<br>ducks, were unable to learn the Seven Commandments by heart. After much<br>thought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in effect be<br>reduced to a single maxim, namely: "Four legs good, two legs bad." This,<br>he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism. Whoever had<br>thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences. The birds at<br>first objected, since it seemed to them that they also had two legs, but<br>Snowball proved to them that this was not so.<br><br>"A bird's wing, comrades," he said, "is an organ of propulsion and not of<br>manipulation. It should therefore be regarded as a leg. The distinguishing<br>mark of man is the HAND, the instrument with which he does all his<br>mischief."<br><br>The birds did not understand Snowball's long words, but they accepted his<br>explanation, and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the new<br>maxim by heart. FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD, was inscribed on the end<br>wall of the barn, above the Seven Commandments and in bigger letters When<br>they had once got it by heart, the sheep developed a great liking for this<br>maxim, and often as they lay in the field they would all start bleating<br>"Four legs good, two legs bad! Four legs good, two legs bad!" and keep it<br>up for hours on end, never growing tired of it.<br><br>Napoleon took no interest in Snowball's committees. He said that the<br>education of the young was more important than anything that could be done<br>for those who were already grown up. It happened that Jessie and Bluebell<br>had both whelped soon after the hay harvest, giving birth between them to<br>nine sturdy puppies. As soon as they were weaned, Napoleon took them away<br>from their mothers, saying that he would make himself responsible for<br>their education. He took them up into a loft which could only be reached<br>by a ladder from the harness-room, and there kept them in such seclusion<br>that the rest of the farm soon forgot their existence.<br><br>The mystery of where the milk went to was soon cleared up. It was mixed<br>every day into the pigs' mash. The early apples were now ripening, and the<br>grass of the orchard was littered with windfalls. The animals had assumed<br>as a matter of course that these would be shared out equally; one day,<br>however, the order went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected<br>and brought to the harness-room for the use of the pigs. At this some of<br>the other animals murmured, but it was no use. All the pigs were in full<br>agreement on this point, even Snowball and Napoleon. Squealer was sent to<br>make the necessary explanations to the others.<br><br>"Comrades!" he cried. "You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing<br>this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually dislike<br>milk and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking these<br>things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proved by<br>Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the<br>well-being of a pig. We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and<br>organisation of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over<br>your welfare. It is for YOUR sake that we drink that milk and eat those<br>apples. Do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty? Jones<br>would come back! Yes, Jones would come back! Surely, comrades," cried<br>Squealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and whisking his<br>tail, "surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back?"<br><br>Now if there was one thing that the animals were completely certain of, it<br>was that they did not want Jones back. When it was put to them in this<br>light, they had no more to say. The importance of keeping the pigs in good<br>health was all too obvious. So it was agreed without further argument that<br>the milk and the windfall apples (and also the main crop of apples when<br>they ripened) should be reserved for the pigs alone.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/1.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/3.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
