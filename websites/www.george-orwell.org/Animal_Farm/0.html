<h2>Chapter I</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but<br>was too drunk to remember to shut the pop-holes. With the ring of light<br>from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard,<br>kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer<br>from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where<br>Mrs. Jones was already snoring.<br><br>As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a<br>fluttering all through the farm buildings. Word had gone round during the<br>day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange dream<br>on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals.<br>It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as<br>Mr. Jones was safely out of the way. Old Major (so he was always called,<br>though the name under which he had been exhibited was Willingdon Beauty)<br>was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose<br>an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say.<br><br>At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was<br>already ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a<br>beam. He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he<br>was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in<br>spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut. Before long the<br>other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their<br>different fashions. First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and<br>Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately in<br>front of the platform. The hens perched themselves on the window-sills,<br>the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down<br>behind the pigs and began to chew the cud. The two cart-horses, Boxer and<br>Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast<br>hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal<br>concealed in the straw. Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching<br>middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal.<br>Boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as<br>any two ordinary horses put together. A white stripe down his nose gave<br>him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate<br>intelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness of<br>character and tremendous powers of work. After the horses came Muriel,<br>the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey. Benjamin was the oldest animal<br>on the farm, and the worst tempered. He seldom talked, and when he did, it<br>was usually to make some cynical remark--for instance, he would say that<br>God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner<br>have had no tail and no flies. Alone among the animals on the farm he<br>never laughed. If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at.<br>Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer; the<br>two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small paddock<br>beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.<br><br>The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had<br>lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from<br>side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on. Clover<br>made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklings<br>nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep. At the last moment<br>Mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew Mr. Jones's trap, came<br>mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar. She took a place near the<br>front and began flirting her white mane, hoping to draw attention to the<br>red ribbons it was plaited with. Last of all came the cat, who looked<br>round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in<br>between Boxer and Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout Major's<br>speech without listening to a word of what he was saying.<br><br>All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven, who slept<br>on a perch behind the back door. When Major saw that they had all made<br>themselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throat<br>and began:<br><br>"Comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that I had last<br>night. But I will come to the dream later. I have something else to say<br>first. I do not think, comrades, that I shall be with you for many months<br>longer, and before I die, I feel it my duty to pass on to you such wisdom<br>as I have acquired. I have had a long life, I have had much time for<br>thought as I lay alone in my stall, and I think I may say that I<br>understand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal now<br>living. It is about this that I wish to speak to you.<br><br>"Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it:<br>our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given<br>just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us<br>who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength;<br>and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are<br>slaughtered with hideous cruelty. No animal in England knows the meaning<br>of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. No animal in England is<br>free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth.<br><br>"But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this land<br>of ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell<br>upon it? No, comrades, a thousand times no! The soil of England is<br>fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance<br>to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it. This<br>single farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of<br>sheep--and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that are now<br>almost beyond our imagining. Why then do we continue in this miserable<br>condition? Because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolen<br>from us by human beings. There, comrades, is the answer to all our<br>problems. It is summed up in a single word--Man. Man is the only real<br>enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and<br>overwork is abolished for ever.<br><br>"Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not<br>give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he<br>cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the<br>animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that<br>will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself. Our<br>labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there is not one of<br>us that owns more than his bare skin. You cows that I see before me, how<br>many thousands of gallons of milk have you given during this last year?<br>And what has happened to that milk which should have been breeding up<br>sturdy calves? Every drop of it has gone down the throats of our enemies.<br>And you hens, how many eggs have you laid in this last year, and how many<br>of those eggs ever hatched into chickens? The rest have all gone to market<br>to bring in money for Jones and his men. And you, Clover, where are those<br>four foals you bore, who should have been the support and pleasure of your<br>old age? Each was sold at a year old--you will never see one of them<br>again. In return for your four confinements and all your labour in the<br>fields, what have you ever had except your bare rations and a stall?<br><br>"And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their<br>natural span. For myself I do not grumble, for I am one of the lucky ones.<br>I am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children. Such is the<br>natural life of a pig. But no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end.<br>You young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one of you will<br>scream your lives out at the block within a year. To that horror we all<br>must come--cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone. Even the horses and the dogs<br>have no better fate. You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles of<br>yours lose their power, Jones will sell you to the knacker, who will cut<br>your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds. As for the dogs, when<br>they grow old and toothless, Jones ties a brick round their necks and<br>drowns them in the nearest pond.<br><br>"Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life<br>of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings? Only get rid of Man, and<br>the produce of our labour would be our own. Almost overnight we could<br>become rich and free. What then must we do? Why, work night and day, body<br>and soul, for the overthrow of the human race! That is my message to you,<br>comrades: Rebellion! I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it might<br>be in a week or in a hundred years, but I know, as surely as I see this<br>straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be done. Fix your<br>eyes on that, comrades, throughout the short remainder of your lives! And<br>above all, pass on this message of mine to those who come after you, so<br>that future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious.<br><br>"And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No argument<br>must lead you astray. Never listen when they tell you that Man and the<br>animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is the<br>prosperity of the others. It is all lies. Man serves the interests of no<br>creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity,<br>perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All animals are<br>comrades."<br><br>At this moment there was a tremendous uproar. While Major was speaking<br>four large rats had crept out of their holes and were sitting on their<br>hindquarters, listening to him. The dogs had suddenly caught sight of<br>them, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the rats saved<br>their lives. Major raised his trotter for silence.<br><br>"Comrades," he said, "here is a point that must be settled. The wild<br>creatures, such as rats and rabbits--are they our friends or our enemies?<br>Let us put it to the vote. I propose this question to the meeting: Are<br>rats comrades?"<br><br>The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majority<br>that rats were comrades. There were only four dissentients, the three dogs<br>and the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on both sides.<br>Major continued:<br><br>"I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your duty of<br>enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs is an<br>enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. And<br>remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemble<br>him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices. No animal<br>must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink<br>alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. All the<br>habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over<br>his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No<br>animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.<br><br>"And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I cannot<br>describe that dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it will be when<br>Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I had long<br>forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the<br>other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and<br>the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had<br>long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me<br>in my dream. And what is more, the words of the song also came back-words,<br>I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been<br>lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that song now, comrades.<br>I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, you<br>can sing it better for yourselves. It is called 'Beasts of England'."<br><br>Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his voice<br>was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something<br>between 'Clementine' and 'La Cucaracha'. The words ran:<br><br>Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,<br>Beasts of every land and clime,<br>Hearken to my joyful tidings<br>Of the golden future time.<br><br>Soon or late the day is coming,<br>Tyrant Man shall be o'erthrown,<br>And the fruitful fields of England<br>Shall be trod by beasts alone.<br><br>Rings shall vanish from our noses,<br>And the harness from our back,<br>Bit and spur shall rust forever,<br>Cruel whips no more shall crack.<br><br>Riches more than mind can picture,<br>Wheat and barley, oats and hay,<br>Clover, beans, and mangel-wurzels<br>Shall be ours upon that day.<br><br>Bright will shine the fields of England,<br>Purer shall its waters be,<br>Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes<br>On the day that sets us free.<br><br>For that day we all must labour,<br>Though we die before it break;<br>Cows and horses, geese and turkeys,<br>All must toil for freedom's sake.<br><br>Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,<br>Beasts of every land and clime,<br>Hearken well and spread my tidings<br>Of the golden future time.<br><br><br>The singing of this song threw the animals into the wildest excitement.<br>Almost before Major had reached the end, they had begun singing it for<br>themselves. Even the stupidest of them had already picked up the tune and<br>a few of the words, and as for the clever ones, such as the pigs and dogs,<br>they had the entire song by heart within a few minutes. And then, after a<br>few preliminary tries, the whole farm burst out into 'Beasts of England' in<br>tremendous unison. The cows lowed it, the dogs whined it, the sheep<br>bleated it, the horses whinnied it, the ducks quacked it. They were so<br>delighted with the song that they sang it right through five times in<br>succession, and might have continued singing it all night if they had not<br>been interrupted.<br><br>Unfortunately, the uproar awoke Mr. Jones, who sprang out of bed, making<br>sure that there was a fox in the yard. He seized the gun which always<br>stood in a corner of his bedroom, and let fly a charge of number 6 shot<br>into the darkness. The pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn<br>and the meeting broke up hurriedly. Everyone fled to his own<br>sleeping-place. The birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settled<br>down in the straw, and the whole farm was asleep in a moment.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/1.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
