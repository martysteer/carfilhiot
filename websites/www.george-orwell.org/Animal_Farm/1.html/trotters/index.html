<h2>Chapter II</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>Three nights later old Major died peacefully in his sleep. His body was<br>buried at the foot of the orchard.<br><br>This was early in March. During the next three months there was much<br>secret activity. Major's speech had given to the more intelligent animals<br>on the farm a completely new outlook on life. They did not know when the<br>Rebellion predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason for<br>thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly<br>that it was their duty to prepare for it. The work of teaching and<br>organising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generally<br>recognised as being the cleverest of the animals. Pre-eminent among the<br>pigs were two young boars named Snowball and Napoleon, whom Mr. Jones was<br>breeding up for sale. Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking<br>Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but<br>with a reputation for getting his own way. Snowball was a more vivacious<br>pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not<br>considered to have the same depth of character. All the other male pigs on<br>the farm were porkers. The best known among them was a small fat pig named<br>Squealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a<br>shrill voice. He was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some<br>difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking<br>his tail which was somehow very persuasive. The others said of Squealer<br>that he could turn black into white.<br><br>These three had elaborated old Major's teachings into a complete system of<br>thought, to which they gave the name of Animalism. Several nights a week,<br>after Mr. Jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in the barn and<br>expounded the principles of Animalism to the others. At the beginning they<br>met with much stupidity and apathy. Some of the animals talked of the duty<br>of loyalty to Mr. Jones, whom they referred to as "Master," or made<br>elementary remarks such as "Mr. Jones feeds us. If he were gone, we should<br>starve to death." Others asked such questions as "Why should we care what<br>happens after we are dead?" or "If this Rebellion is to happen anyway,<br>what difference does it make whether we work for it or not?", and the pigs<br>had great difficulty in making them see that this was contrary to the<br>spirit of Animalism. The stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie,<br>the white mare. The very first question she asked Snowball was: "Will<br>there still be sugar after the Rebellion?"<br><br>"No," said Snowball firmly. "We have no means of making sugar on this<br>farm. Besides, you do not need sugar. You will have all the oats and hay<br>you want."<br><br>"And shall I still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane?" asked Mollie.<br><br>"Comrade," said Snowball, "those ribbons that you are so devoted to are<br>the badge of slavery. Can you not understand that liberty is worth more<br>than ribbons?"<br><br>Mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced.<br><br>The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by<br>Moses, the tame raven. Moses, who was Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy<br>and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker. He claimed to know of<br>the existence of a mysterious country called Sugarcandy Mountain, to which<br>all animals went when they died. It was situated somewhere up in the sky,<br>a little distance beyond the clouds, Moses said. In Sugarcandy Mountain it<br>was Sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and<br>lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges. The animals hated Moses<br>because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in<br>Sugarcandy Mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them<br>that there was no such place.<br><br>Their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover.<br>These two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves,<br>but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they absorbed<br>everything that they were told, and passed it on to the other animals by<br>simple arguments. They were unfailing in their attendance at the secret<br>meetings in the barn, and led the singing of 'Beasts of England', with which<br>the meetings always ended.<br><br>Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and more<br>easily than anyone had expected. In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard<br>master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days.<br>He had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit, and had<br>taken to drinking more than was good for him. For whole days at a time he<br>would lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers,<br>drinking, and occasionally feeding Moses on crusts of bread soaked in<br>beer. His men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the<br>buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were<br>underfed.<br><br>June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On Midsummer's Eve,<br>which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and got so drunk at<br>the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday. The men had<br>milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting,<br>without bothering to feed the animals. When Mr. Jones got back he<br>immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the News of the<br>World over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still<br>unfed. At last they could stand it no longer. One of the cows broke in the<br>door of the store-shed with her horn and all the animals began to help<br>themselves from the bins. It was just then that Mr. Jones woke up. The<br>next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in their<br>hands, lashing out in all directions. This was more than the hungry<br>animals could bear. With one accord, though nothing of the kind had been<br>planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors. Jones and<br>his men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides.<br>The situation was quite out of their control. They had never seen animals<br>behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they<br>were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them<br>almost out of their wits. After only a moment or two they gave up trying<br>to defend themselves and took to their heels. A minute later all five of<br>them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road,<br>with the animals pursuing them in triumph.<br><br>Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening,<br>hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of<br>the farm by another way. Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her,<br>croaking loudly. Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on<br>to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. And so, almost<br>before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully<br>carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.<br><br>For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good<br>fortune. Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the<br>boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being<br>was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to<br>wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign. The harness-room at the<br>end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the<br>dog-chains, the cruel knives with which Mr. Jones had been used to<br>castrate the pigs and lambs, were all flung down the well. The reins, the<br>halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags, were thrown on to the<br>rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. So were the whips. All the<br>animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames.<br>Snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses'<br>manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.<br><br>"Ribbons," he said, "should be considered as clothes, which are the mark<br>of a human being. All animals should go naked."<br><br>When Boxer heard this he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in<br>summer to keep the flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the fire with<br>the rest.<br><br>In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded<br>them of Mr. Jones. Napoleon then led them back to the store-shed and<br>served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for<br>each dog. Then they sang 'Beasts of England' from end to end seven times<br>running, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as they<br>had never slept before.<br><br>But they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the glorious<br>thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together. A<br>little way down the pasture there was a knoll that commanded a view of<br>most of the farm. The animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round them<br>in the clear morning light. Yes, it was theirs--everything that they could<br>see was theirs! In the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round and<br>round, they hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement.<br>They rolled in the dew, they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass,<br>they kicked up clods of the black earth and snuffed its rich scent. Then<br>they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with<br>speechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool,<br>the spinney. It was as though they had never seen these things before, and<br>even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own.<br><br>Then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outside<br>the door of the farmhouse. That was theirs too, but they were frightened<br>to go inside. After a moment, however, Snowball and Napoleon butted the<br>door open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file,<br>walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything. They tiptoed<br>from room to room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind<br>of awe at the unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their feather<br>mattresses, the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa, the Brussels carpet,<br>the lithograph of Queen Victoria over the drawing-room mantelpiece. They<br>were lust coming down the stairs when Mollie was discovered to be missing.<br>Going back, the others found that she had remained behind in the best<br>bedroom. She had taken a piece of blue ribbon from Mrs. Jones's<br>dressing-table, and was holding it against her shoulder and admiring<br>herself in the glass in a very foolish manner. The others reproached her<br>sharply, and they went outside. Some hams hanging in the kitchen were<br>taken out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the scullery was stove in<br>with a kick from Boxer's hoof, otherwise nothing in the house was touched.<br>A unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should be<br>preserved as a museum. All were agreed that no animal must ever live there.<br><br>The animals had their breakfast, and then Snowball and Napoleon called<br>them together again.<br><br>"Comrades," said Snowball, "it is half-past six and we have a long day<br>before us. Today we begin the hay harvest. But there is another matter<br>that must be attended to first."<br><br>The pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had taught<br>themselves to read and write from an old spelling book which had belonged<br>to Mr. Jones's children and which had been thrown on the rubbish heap.<br>Napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the way down to<br>the five-barred gate that gave on to the main road. Then Snowball (for it<br>was Snowball who was best at writing) took a brush between the two<br>knuckles of his trotter, painted out MANOR FARM from the top bar of the<br>gate and in its place painted ANIMAL FARM. This was to be the name of the<br>farm from now onwards. After this they went back to the farm buildings,<br>where Snowball and Napoleon sent for a ladder which they caused to be set<br>against the end wall of the big barn. They explained that by their studies<br>of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles<br>of Animalism to Seven Commandments. These Seven Commandments would now be<br>inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the<br>animals on Animal Farm must live for ever after. With some difficulty<br>(for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) Snowball<br>climbed up and set to work, with Squealer a few rungs below him holding<br>the paint-pot. The Commandments were written on the tarred wall in great<br>white letters that could be read thirty yards away. They ran thus:<br><br><br>THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS<br><br>1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.<br>2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.<br>3. No animal shall wear clothes.<br>4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.<br>5. No animal shall drink alcohol.<br>6. No animal shall kill any other animal.<br>7. All animals are equal.<br><br><br>It was very neatly written, and except that "friend" was written "freind"<br>and one of the "S's" was the wrong way round, the spelling was correct all<br>the way through. Snowball read it aloud for the benefit of the others. All<br>the animals nodded in complete agreement, and the cleverer ones at once<br>began to learn the Commandments by heart.<br><br>"Now, comrades," cried Snowball, throwing down the paint-brush, "to the<br>hayfield! Let us make it a point of honour to get in the harvest more<br>quickly than Jones and his men could do."<br><br>But at this moment the three cows, who had seemed uneasy for some time<br>past, set up a loud lowing. They had not been milked for twenty-four<br>hours, and their udders were almost bursting. After a little thought, the<br>pigs sent for buckets and milked the cows fairly successfully, their<br <B style="color:black;background-color:#99CCCC">trotters</B> being well adapted to this task. Soon there were five buckets of<br>frothing creamy milk at which many of the animals looked with considerable<br>interest.<br><br>"What is going to happen to all that milk?" said someone.<br><br>"Jones used sometimes to mix some of it in our mash," said one of the hens.<br><br>"Never mind the milk, comrades!" cried Napoleon, placing himself in front<br>of the buckets. "That will be attended to. The harvest is more important.<br>Comrade Snowball will lead the way. I shall follow in a few minutes.<br>Forward, comrades! The hay is waiting."<br><br>So the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and when<br>they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/0.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/2.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
