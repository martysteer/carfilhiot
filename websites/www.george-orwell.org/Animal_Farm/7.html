<h2>Chapter VIII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>A few days later, when the terror caused by the executions had died down,<br>some of the animals remembered--or thought they remembered--that the Sixth<br>Commandment decreed "No animal shall kill any other animal." And though no<br>one cared to mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the dogs, it was<br>felt that the killings which had taken place did not square with this.<br>Clover asked Benjamin to read her the Sixth Commandment, and when<br>Benjamin, as usual, said that he refused to meddle in such matters, she<br>fetched Muriel. Muriel read the Commandment for her. It ran: "No animal<br>shall kill any other animal WITHOUT CAUSE." Somehow or other, the last two<br>words had slipped out of the animals' memory. But they saw now that the<br>Commandment had not been violated; for clearly there was good reason for<br>killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with Snowball.<br><br>Throughout the year the animals worked even harder than they had worked in<br>the previous year. To rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as thick as<br>before, and to finish it by the appointed date, together with the regular<br>work of the farm, was a tremendous labour. There were times when it seemed<br>to the animals that they worked longer hours and fed no better than they<br>had done in Jones's day. On Sunday mornings Squealer, holding down a long<br>strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures<br>proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by<br>two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, or five hundred per cent,<br>as the case might be. The animals saw no reason to disbelieve him,<br>especially as they could no longer remember very clearly what conditions<br>had been like before the Rebellion. All the same, there were days when<br>they felt that they would sooner have had less figures and more food.<br><br>All orders were now issued through Squealer or one of the other pigs.<br>Napoleon himself was not seen in public as often as once in a fortnight.<br>When he did appear, he was attended not only by his retinue of dogs but by<br>a black cockerel who marched in front of him and acted as a kind of<br>trumpeter, letting out a loud "cock-a-doodle-doo" before Napoleon spoke.<br>Even in the farmhouse, it was said, Napoleon inhabited separate apartments<br>from the others. He took his meals alone, with two dogs to wait upon him,<br>and always ate from the Crown Derby dinner service which had been in the<br>glass cupboard in the drawing-room. It was also announced that the gun<br>would be fired every year on Napoleon's birthday, as well as on the other<br>two anniversaries.<br><br>Napoleon was now never spoken of simply as "Napoleon." He was always<br>referred to in formal style as "our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," and this<br>pigs liked to invent for him such titles as Father of All Animals, Terror<br>of Mankind, Protector of the Sheep-fold, Ducklings' Friend, and the like.<br>In his speeches, Squealer would talk with the tears rolling down his<br>cheeks of Napoleon's wisdom the goodness of his heart, and the deep love<br>he bore to all animals everywhere, even and especially the unhappy animals<br>who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms. It had become<br>usual to give Napoleon the credit for every successful achievement and<br>every stroke of good fortune. You would often hear one hen remark to<br>another, "Under the guidance of our Leader, Comrade Napoleon, I have laid<br>five eggs in six days"; or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would<br>exclaim, "Thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, how excellent this<br>water tastes!" The general feeling on the farm was well expressed in a<br>poem entitled Comrade Napoleon, which was composed by Minimus and which<br>ran as follows:<br><br><br>Friend of fatherless!<br>Fountain of happiness!<br>Lord of the swill-bucket! Oh, how my soul is on<br>Fire when I gaze at thy<br>Calm and commanding eye,<br>Like the sun in the sky,<br>Comrade Napoleon!<br><br>Thou are the giver of<br>All that thy creatures love,<br>Full belly twice a day, clean straw to roll upon;<br>Every beast great or small<br>Sleeps at peace in his stall,<br>Thou watchest over all,<br>Comrade Napoleon!<br><br>Had I a sucking-pig,<br>Ere he had grown as big<br>Even as a pint bottle or as a rolling-pin,<br>He should have learned to be<br>Faithful and true to thee,<br>Yes, his first squeak should be<br>"Comrade Napoleon!"<br><br><br>Napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to be inscribed on the wall<br>of the big barn, at the opposite end from the Seven Commandments. It was<br>surmounted by a portrait of Napoleon, in profile, executed by Squealer in<br>white paint.<br><br>Meanwhile, through the agency of Whymper, Napoleon was engaged in<br>complicated negotiations with Frederick and Pilkington. The pile of timber<br>was still unsold. Of the two, Frederick was the more anxious to get hold<br>of it, but he would not offer a reasonable price. At the same time there<br>were renewed rumours that Frederick and his men were plotting to attack<br>Animal Farm and to destroy the windmill, the building of which had aroused<br>furious jealousy in him. Snowball was known to be still skulking on<br>Pinchfield Farm. In the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to<br>hear that three hens had come forward and confessed that, inspired by<br>Snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder Napoleon. They were<br>executed immediately, and fresh precautions for Napoleon's safety were<br>taken. Four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at each corner, and a young<br>pig named Pinkeye was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate<br>it, lest it should be poisoned.<br><br>At about the same time it was given out that Napoleon had arranged to sell<br>the pile of timber to Mr. Pilkington; he was also going to enter into a<br>regular agreement for the exchange of certain products between Animal Farm<br>and Foxwood. The relations between Napoleon and Pilkington, though they<br>were only conducted through Whymper, were now almost friendly. The animals<br>distrusted Pilkington, as a human being, but greatly preferred him to<br>Frederick, whom they both feared and hated. As the summer wore on, and the<br>windmill neared completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack<br>grew stronger and stronger. Frederick, it was said, intended to bring<br>against them twenty men all armed with guns, and he had already bribed the<br>magistrates and police, so that if he could once get hold of the<br>title-deeds of Animal Farm they would ask no questions. Moreover, terrible<br>stories were leaking out from Pinchfield about the cruelties that<br>Frederick practised upon his animals. He had flogged an old horse to<br>death, he starved his cows, he had killed a dog by throwing it into the<br>furnace, he amused himself in the evenings by making cocks fight with<br>splinters of razor-blade tied to their spurs. The animals' blood boiled<br>with rage when they heard of these things beingdone to their comrades,<br>and sometimes they clamoured to be allowed to go out in a body and attack<br>Pinchfield Farm, drive out the humans, and set the animals free. But<br>Squealer counselled them to avoid rash actions and trust in Comrade<br>Napoleon's strategy.<br><br>Nevertheless, feeling against Frederick continued to run high. One Sunday<br>morning Napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at<br>any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to Frederick; he<br>considered it beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings with<br>scoundrels of that description. The pigeons who were still sent out to<br>spread tidings of the Rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere on<br>Foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of "Death to<br>Humanity" in favour of "Death to Frederick." In the late summer yet<br>another of Snowball's machinations was laid bare. The wheat crop was full<br>of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits<br>Snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn. A gander who had been<br>privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to Squealer and immediately<br>committed suicide by swallowing deadly nightshade berries. The animals<br>now also learned that Snowball had never--as many of them had believed<br>hitherto--received the order of "Animal Hero, First Class." This was<br>merely a legend which had been spread some time after the Battle of the<br>Cowshed by Snowball himself. So far from being decorated, he had been<br>censured for showing cowardice in the battle. Once again some of the<br>animals heard this with a certain bewilderment, but Squealer was soon able<br>to convince them that their memories had been at fault.<br><br>In the autumn, by a tremendous, exhausting effort--for the harvest had to<br>be gathered at almost the same time--the windmill was finished. The<br>machinery had still to be installed, and Whymper was negotiating the<br>purchase of it, but the structure was completed. In the teeth of every<br>difficulty, in spite of inexperience, of primitive implements, of bad luck<br>and of Snowball's treachery, the work had been finished punctually to the<br>very day! Tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round their<br>masterpiece, which appeared even more beautiful in their eyes than when it<br>had been built the first time. Moreover, the walls were twice as thick as<br>before. Nothing short of explosives would lay them low this time! And when<br>they thought of how they had laboured, what discouragements they had<br>overcome, and the enormous difference that would be made in their lives<br>when the sails were turning and the dynamos running--when they thought of<br>all this, their tiredness forsook them and they gambolled round and round<br>the windmill, uttering cries of triumph. Napoleon himself, attended by his<br>dogs and his cockerel, came down to inspect the completed work; he<br>personally congratulated the animals on their achievement, and announced<br>that the mill would be named Napoleon Mill.<br><br>Two days later the animals were called together for a special meeting in<br>the barn. They were struck dumb with surprise when Napoleon announced that<br>he had sold the pile of timber to Frederick. Tomorrow Frederick's wagons<br>would arrive and begin carting it away. Throughout the whole period of his<br>seeming friendship with Pilkington, Napoleon had really been in secret<br>agreement with Frederick.<br><br>All relations with Foxwood had been broken off; insulting messages had<br>been sent to Pilkington. The pigeons had been told to avoid Pinchfield<br>Farm and to alter their slogan from "Death to Frederick" to "Death to<br>Pilkington." At the same time Napoleon assured the animals that the<br>stories of an impending attack on Animal Farm were completely untrue, and<br>that the tales about Frederick's cruelty to his own animals had been<br>greatly exaggerated. All these rumours had probably originated with<br>Snowball and his agents. It now appeared that Snowball was not, after all,<br>hiding on Pinchfield Farm, and in fact had never been there in his life:<br>he was living--in considerable luxury, so it was said--at Foxwood, and had<br>in reality been a pensioner of Pilkington for years past.<br><br>The pigs were in ecstasies over Napoleon's cunning. By seeming to be<br>friendly with Pilkington he had forced Frederick to raise his price by<br>twelve pounds. But the superior quality of Napoleon's mind, said Squealer,<br>was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even Frederick.<br>Frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque,<br>which, it seemed, was a piece of paper with a promise to pay written upon<br>it. But Napoleon was too clever for him. He had demanded payment in real<br>five-pound notes, which were to be handed over before the timber was<br>removed. Already Frederick had paid up; and the sum he had paid was just<br>enough to buy the machinery for the windmill.<br><br>Meanwhile the timber was being carted away at high speed. When it was all<br>gone, another special meeting was held in the barn for the animals to<br>inspect Frederick's bank-notes. Smiling beatifically, and wearing both his<br>decorations, Napoleon reposed on a bed of straw on the platform, with the<br>money at his side, neatly piled on a china dish from the farmhouse<br>kitchen. The animals filed slowly past, and each gazed his fill. And Boxer<br>put out his nose to sniff at the bank-notes, and the flimsy white things<br>stirred and rustled in his breath.<br><br>Three days later there was a terrible hullabaloo. Whymper, his face deadly<br>pale, came racing up the path on his bicycle, flung it down in the yard<br>and rushed straight into the farmhouse. The next moment a choking roar of<br>rage sounded from Napoleon's apartments. The news of what had happened<br>sped round the farm like wildfire. The banknotes were forgeries! Frederick<br>had got the timber for nothing!<br><br>Napoleon called the animals together immediately and in a terrible voice<br>pronounced the death sentence upon Frederick. When captured, he said,<br>Frederick should be boiled alive. At the same time he warned them that<br>after this treacherous deed the worst was to be expected. Frederick and<br>his men might make their long-expected attack at any moment. Sentinels<br>were placed at all the approaches to the farm. In addition, four pigeons<br>were sent to Foxwood with a conciliatory message, which it was hoped might<br>re-establish good relations with Pilkington.<br><br>The very next morning the attack came. The animals were at breakfast when<br>the look-outs came racing in with the news that Frederick and his<br>followers had already come through the five-barred gate. Boldly enough the<br>animals sallied forth to meet them, but this time they did not have the<br>easy victory that they had had in the Battle of the Cowshed. There were<br>fifteen men, with half a dozen guns between them, and they opened fire as<br>soon as they got within fifty yards. The animals could not face the<br>terrible explosions and the stinging pellets, and in spite of the efforts<br>of Napoleon and Boxer to rally them, they were soon driven back. A number<br>of them were already wounded. They took refuge in the farm buildings and<br>peeped cautiously out from chinks and knot-holes. The whole of the big<br>pasture, including the windmill, was in the hands of the enemy. For the<br>moment even Napoleon seemed at a loss. He paced up and down without a<br>word, his tail rigid and twitching. Wistful glances were sent in the<br>direction of Foxwood. If Pilkington and his men would help them, the day<br>might yet be won. But at this moment the four pigeons, who had been sent<br>out on the day before, returned, one of them bearing a scrap of paper from<br>Pilkington. On it was pencilled the words: "Serves you right."<br><br>Meanwhile Frederick and his men had halted about the windmill. The animals<br>watched them, and a murmur of dismay went round. Two of the men had<br>produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer. They were going to knock the<br>windmill down.<br><br>"Impossible!" cried Napoleon. "We have built the walls far too thick for<br>that. They could not knock it down in a week. Courage, comrades!"<br><br>But Benjamin was watching the movements of the men intently. The two with<br>the hammer and the crowbar were drilling a hole near the base of the<br>windmill. Slowly, and with an air almost of amusement, Benjamin nodded his<br>long muzzle.<br><br>"I thought so," he said. "Do you not see what they are doing? In another<br>moment they are going to pack blasting powder into that hole."<br><br>Terrified, the animals waited. It was impossible now to venture out of the<br>shelter of the buildings. After a few minutes the men were seen to be<br>running in all directions. Then there was a deafening roar. The pigeons<br>swirled into the air, and all the animals, except Napoleon, flung<br>themselves flat on their bellies and hid their faces. When they got up<br>again, a huge cloud of black smoke was hanging where the windmill had<br>been. Slowly the breeze drifted it away. The windmill had ceased to exist!<br><br>At this sight the animals' courage returned to them. The fear and despair<br>they had felt a moment earlier were drowned in their rage against this<br>vile, contemptible act. A mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without<br>waiting for further orders they charged forth in a body and made straight<br>for the enemy. This time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept<br>over them like hail. It was a savage, bitter battle. The men fired again<br>and again, and, when the animals got to close quarters, lashed out with<br>their sticks and their heavy boots. A cow, three sheep, and two geese were<br>killed, and nearly everyone was wounded. Even Napoleon, who was directing<br>operations from the rear, had the tip of his tail chipped by a pellet. But<br>the men did not go unscathed either. Three of them had their heads broken<br>by blows from Boxer's hoofs; another was gored in the belly by a cow's<br>horn; another had his trousers nearly torn off by Jessie and Bluebell. And<br>when the nine dogs of Napoleon's own bodyguard, whom he had instructed to<br>make a detour under cover of the hedge, suddenly appeared on the men's<br>flank, baying ferociously, panic overtook them. They saw that they were in<br>danger of being surrounded. Frederick shouted to his men to get out while<br>the going was good, and the next moment the cowardly enemy was running for<br>dear life. The animals chased them right down to the bottom of the field,<br>and got in some last kicks at them as they forced their way through the<br>thorn hedge.<br><br>They had won, but they were weary and bleeding. Slowly they began to limp<br>back towards the farm. The sight of their dead comrades stretched upon the<br>grass moved some of them to tears. And for a little while they halted in<br>sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill had once stood. Yes, it<br>was gone; almost the last trace of their labour was gone! Even the<br>foundations were partially destroyed. And in rebuilding it they could not<br>this time, as before, make use of the fallen stones. This time the stones<br>had vanished too. The force of the explosion had flung them to distances<br>of hundreds of yards. It was as though the windmill had never been.<br><br>As they approached the farm Squealer, who had unaccountably been absent<br>during the fighting, came skipping towards them, whisking his tail and<br>beaming with satisfaction. And the animals heard, from the direction of<br>the farm buildings, the solemn booming of a gun.<br><br>"What is that gun firing for?" said Boxer.<br><br>"To celebrate our victory!" cried Squealer.<br><br>"What victory?" said Boxer. His knees were bleeding, he had lost a shoe<br>and split his hoof, and a dozen pellets had lodged themselves in his hind<br>leg.<br><br>"What victory, comrade? Have we not driven the enemy off our soil--the<br>sacred soil of Animal Farm?"<br><br>"But they have destroyed the windmill. And we had worked on it for two<br>years!"<br><br>"What matter? We will build another windmill. We will build six windmills<br>if we feel like it. You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that<br>we have done. The enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we<br>stand upon. And now--thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon--we have<br>won every inch of it back again!"<br><br>"Then we have won back what we had before," said Boxer.<br><br>"That is our victory," said Squealer.<br><br>They limped into the yard. The pellets under the skin of Boxer's leg<br>smarted painfully. He saw ahead of him the heavy labour of rebuilding the<br>windmill from the foundations, and already in imagination he braced<br>himself for the task. But for the first time it occurred to him that he<br>was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite<br>what they had once been.<br><br>But when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun firing<br>again--seven times it was fired in all--and heard the speech that Napoleon<br>made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to them after all<br>that they had won a great victory. The animals slain in the battle were<br>given a solemn funeral. Boxer and Clover pulled the wagon which served as<br>a hearse, and Napoleon himself walked at the head of the procession. Two<br>whole days were given over to celebrations. There were songs, speeches,<br>and more firing of the gun, and a special gift of an apple was bestowed on<br>every animal, with two ounces of corn for each bird and three biscuits for<br>each dog. It was announced that the battle would be called the Battle of<br>the Windmill, and that Napoleon had created a new decoration, the Order<br>of the Green Banner, which he had conferred upon himself. In the general<br>rejoicings the unfortunate affair of the banknotes was forgotten.<br><br>It was a few days later than this that the pigs came upon a case of whisky<br>in the cellars of the farmhouse. It had been overlooked at the time when<br>the house was first occupied. That night there came from the farmhouse the<br>sound of loud singing, in which, to everyone's surprise, the strains of<br>'Beasts of England' were mixed up. At about half past nine Napoleon,<br>wearing an old bowler hat of Mr. Jones's, was distinctly seen to emerge<br>from the back door, gallop rapidly round the yard, and disappear indoors<br>again. But in the morning a deep silence hung over the farmhouse. Not a<br>pig appeared to be stirring. It was nearly nine o'clock when Squealer made<br>his appearance, walking slowly and dejectedly, his eyes dull, his tail<br>hanging limply behind him, and with every appearance of being seriously<br>ill. He called the animals together and told them that he had a terrible<br>piece of news to impart. Comrade Napoleon was dying!<br><br>A cry of lamentation went up. Straw was laid down outside the doors of the<br>farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe. With tears in their eyes they<br>asked one another what they should do if their Leader were taken away from<br>them. A rumour went round that Snowball had after all contrived to<br>introduce poison into Napoleon's food. At eleven o'clock Squealer came<br>out to make another announcement. As his last act upon earth, Comrade<br>Napoleon had pronounced a solemn decree: the drinking of alcohol was to be<br>punished by death.<br><br>By the evening, however, Napoleon appeared to be somewhat better, and the<br>following morning Squealer was able to tell them that he was well on the<br>way to recovery. By the evening of that day Napoleon was back at work, and<br>on the next day it was learned that he had instructed Whymper to purchase<br>in Willingdon some booklets on brewing and distilling. A week later<br>Napoleon gave orders that the small paddock beyond the orchard, which it<br>had previously been intended to set aside as a grazing-ground for animals<br>who were past work, was to be ploughed up. It was given out that the<br>pasture was exhausted and needed re-seeding; but it soon became known that<br>Napoleon intended to sow it with barley.<br><br>About this time there occurred a strange incident which hardly anyone was<br>able to understand. One night at about twelve o'clock there was a loud<br>crash in the yard, and the animals rushed out of their stalls. It was a<br>moonlit night. At the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the<br>Seven Commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two pieces.<br>Squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near at hand<br>there lay a lantern, a paint-brush, and an overturned pot of white paint.<br>The dogs immediately made a ring round Squealer, and escorted him back to<br>the farmhouse as soon as he was able to walk. None of the animals could<br>form any idea as to what this meant, except old Benjamin, who nodded his<br>muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed to understand, but would say nothing.<br><br>But a few days later Muriel, reading over the Seven Commandments to<br>herself, noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals had<br>remembered wrong. They had thought the Fifth Commandment was "No animal<br>shall drink alcohol," but there were two words that they had forgotten.<br>Actually the Commandment read: "No animal shall drink alcohol TO EXCESS."<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/6.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/8.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
