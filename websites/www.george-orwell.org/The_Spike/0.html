<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">It was late-afternoon. Forty-nine of us, forty-eight men and one woman,<br>lay on the green waiting for the spike to open. We were too tired to talk<br>much. We just sprawled about exhaustedly, with home-made cigarettes<br>sticking out of our scrubby faces. Overhead the chestnut branches were<br>covered with blossom. and beyond that great woolly clouds floated almost<br>motionless in a clear sky. Littered on the grass, we seemed dingy, urban<br>riff-raff. We defiled the scene, like sardine-tins and paper bags on the<br>seashore.<br><br>What talk there was ran on the Tramp Major of this spike. He was a devil,<br>everyone agreed, a tartar, a tyrant, a bawling. blasphemous, uncharitable<br>dog. You couldn't call your soul your own when he was about, and many a<br>tramp had he kicked out in the middle of the night for giving a back<br>answer. When You, came to be searched. he fair held you upside down and<br>shook you. If you were caught with tobacco there was bell to. Pay, and if<br>you went in with money (which is against the law) God help you.<br><br>I had eightpence on me. 'For the love of Christ, mate,' the old hands<br>advised me, 'don't you take it in. You'd get seven days for going into<br>the spike with eightpence!'<br><br>So I buried my money in a hole under the hedge, marking the spot with a<br>lump of flint. Then  we set about smuggling our matches and tobacco, for<br>it is forbidden to take these into nearly all spikes. and one is supposed<br>to surrender them at the gate. We hid them in our socks, except for the<br>twenty or so per cent who had no socks, and had to carry the tobacco in<br>their boots, even under their very toes. We stuffed our ankles with<br>contraband until anyone seeing us might have imagined an outbreak of<br>elephantiasis. But is an unwritten law that even the sternest Tramp<br>Majors do not search below the knee, and in the end only one man was<br>caught. This was Scotty, a little hairy tramp with a bastard accent sired<br>by cockney out of Glasgow. His tin of cigarette ends fell out of his sock<br>at the wrong moment, and was impounded.<br><br>At six. the sates swung open and we shuffled in. An official at the gate<br>entered our names and other particulars in the regis. ter and took our<br>bundles away from us. The woman was sent off to the workhouse, and we<br>others into the spike. It was a gloomy, chilly, limewashed place,<br>consisting only of a bathroom and dining-room and about a hundred narrow<br>stone cells. The terrible Tramp Major met us at the door and herded us<br>into the bathroom to be stripped and searched. He was a gruff, soldierly<br>man of forty. who gave the tramps no more ceremony than sheep at the<br>dipping-pond, shoving them this way and that and shouting oaths in their<br>faces. But when he came to myself. he looked hard at me, and said:<br><br>'You are a gentleman?'<br><br>'I suppose so,' I said.<br><br>He gave me another long look. 'Well, that's bloody bad luck, guv'nor,' he<br>said, 'that's bloody bad luck, that is.' And thereafter he took it into<br>his head to treat me with compassion, even with a kind of respect.<br><br>It was a disgusting sight, that bathroom. All the indecent secrets of our<br>underwear were exposed; the grime, the rents and patches, the bits of<br>string doing duty for buttons, the layers upon layers of fragmentary<br>garments. some of them mere collections of holes, held together by dirt.<br>The room became a press m of steaming nudity, the sweaty odours of the<br>tramps competing with the sickly, sub-faecal stench native to the spike.<br>Some of the men refused the bath, and washed only their 'toe-rags', the<br>horrid, greasy little clouts which tramps bind round their feet. Each of<br>us had three minutes in which to bathe himself. Six greasy, slippery<br>roller towels had to serve for the lot of us.<br><br>When we had bathed our own clothes were taken away from us, and we were<br>dressed in the workhouse shirts, grey cotton things like nightshirts,<br>reaching to the middle of the thigh. Then we were sent into the<br>diningroom, where supper was set out on the deal tables. It was the<br>invariable spike meal, always the same, whether breakfast, dinner or<br>supper--half a pound of bread, a bit of margarine, and a pint of<br>so-called tea. It took us five minutes to gulp down the cheap, noxious<br>food. Then the Tramp Major served us with three cotton blankets each, and<br>drove us off to our cells for the night. The doors were locked on the<br>outside a little before seven in the evening, and would stay locked for<br>the next twelve hours.<br><br>The cells measured eight feet by five, and, had no lighting apparatus<br>except a tiny. barred window high up in the wall, and a spyhole in the<br>door. There were no bugs, and we had bedsteads and straw palliasses, rare<br>luxuries both. In many spikes one sleeps on a wooden shelf, and in some<br>on the bare floor, with a rolled-up coat for pillow. With a cell to<br>myself, and a bed, I was hoping for a sound night's rest. But I did not<br>get it, for there is always something wrong in the spike, and the<br>peculiar shortcoming here, as I discovered immediately, was the cold. May<br>had begun, and in honour of the season--a little sacrifice to the gods<br>of spring, perhaps--the authorities had cut off the steam from the hot<br>pipes. The cotton blankets were almost useless. One spent the night in<br>turning from side to side, falling asleep for ten minutes and waking half<br>frozen, and watching for dawn.<br><br>As always happens in the spike, I had at last managed to fan comfortably<br>asleep when it was time to get up. The Tramp. Major came marching down<br>the passage with his heavy tread, unlocking the doors and yelling to us<br>to show a leg. Promptly the passage was full of squalid shirt-clad<br>figures rushing for the bathroom, for there was Only One tub full of<br>water between us all in the morning, and it was first come first served.<br>When I arrived twenty tramps had already washed their faces. I gave one<br>glance at the black scum on top of the water, and decided to go dirty for<br>the day.<br><br>We hurried into our clothes, and then went to the diningroom to bolt our<br>breakfast. The bread was much worse than usual, because the<br>military-minded idiot of a Tramp Major had cut it into slices overnight,<br>so that it was as hard as ship's bisciut. But we were glad of our tea<br>after the cold, restless night. I do not know what tramps would do<br>without tea, or rather the stuff they miscall tea. It is their food,<br>their medicine, their panacea for all evils. Without the half goon or so<br>of it that they suck down a day, I truly believe they could not face<br>their existence.<br><br>After breakfast we had to undress again for the medical inspection, which<br>is a precaution against smallpox. It was three quarters of an hour before<br>the doctor arrived, and one had time now to look about him and see what<br>manner of men we were. it, was an instructive sight. We stood shivering<br>naked to the waist in two long ranks in the passage. The filtered light,<br>bluish and cold, lighted us up with unmerciful clarity. No one can<br>imagine, unless he has seen such a thing, what pot-bellied, degenerate<br>curs we looked. Shock heads, hairy, crumpled faces, hollow chests, flat<br>feet, sagging muscles--every kind of malformation and physical<br>rottenness were there. All were flabby and discoloured, as all tramps are<br>under their deceptive sunburn. Two or three figures wen there stay<br>ineradicably in my mind. Old 'Daddy', aged seventy-four, with his truss,<br>and his red, watering eyes, a herring-gutted starveling with sparse beard<br>and sunken cheeks, looking like the corpse of Lazarus in some primitive<br>picture: an imbecile, wandering hither and thither with vague giggles,<br>coyly pleased because his trousers constantly slipped down and left him<br>nude. But few of us were greatly better than these; there were not ten<br>decently built men among us, and half, I believe, should have been in<br>hospital.<br><br>This being Sunday, we were to be kept in the spike over the week-end. As<br>soon as the doctor had gone we were herded back to the dining-room, and its<br>door shut upon us. It was a lime-washed, stone-floored room, unspeakably<br>dreary with  its furniture of deal boards and benches, and its prison<br>smell. The windows were so high up that one could not look outside, and<br>the sole ornament was a set of Rules threatening dire penalties to any<br>casual who misconducted himself. We packed the room so tight that one<br>could not move an elbow without jostling somebody. Already, at eight<br>o'clock in the morning, we were bored with our captivity. There was<br>nothing to talk about except the petty gossip of the road, the good and<br>bad spikes, the charitable and uncharitable counties, the iniquities of<br>the police and the Salvation Army. Tramps hardly ever get away from these<br>subjects; they talk, as it were, nothing but shop. They have nothing<br>worthy to be called conversation, bemuse emptiness of belly leaves no<br>speculation in their souls. The world is too much with them. Their next<br>meal is never quite secure, and so they cannot think of anything except<br>the next meal.<br><br>Two hours dragged by. Old Daddy, witless with age, sat silent, his back<br>bent like a bow and his inflamed eyes dripping slowly on to the floor.<br>George, a dirty old tramp notorious for the queer habit of sleeping in<br>his hat. grumbled about a parcel of tommy that he had lost on the toad.<br>Bill the moocher, the best built man of us all, a Herculean sturdy beggar<br>who smelt of beer even after twelve hours in the spike, told tales of<br>mooching, of pints stood him in the boozers, and of a parson who had<br>peached to the police and got him seven days. William and, Fred, two<br>young. ex-fishermen from Norfolk, sang a sad song about Unhappy Bella,<br>who was betrayed and died in the snow. The imbecile drivelled, about an<br>imaginary toff, who had once given him two hundred and fifty-seven golden<br>sovereigns. So the time passed, with dun talk and dull obscenities.<br>Everyone was smoking, except Scotty, whose tobacco had been seized, and<br>he was so miserable in his smokeless state that I stood him the makings<br>of a cigarette. We smoked furtively, hiding our cigarettes like<br>schoolboys when we heard the Tramp Major's step, for smoking though<br>connived at, was officially forbidden.<br><br>Most of the tramps spent ten consecutive hours in this dreary room. It is<br>hard to imagine how they put up with 11. I have come to think that<br>boredom is the worst of all a tramp's evils, worse than hunger and<br>discomfort, worse even than the constant feeling of being socially<br>disgraced. It is a silly piece of cruelty to confine an ignorant man all<br>day with nothing to do; it is like chaining a dog in a barrel. only an<br>educated man, who has consolations within himself, can endure<br>confinement. Tramps, unlettered types as nearly all of them are, face<br>their poverty with blank, resourceless minds. Fixed for ten hours on a<br>comfortless bench, they know no way of occupying themselves, and if they<br>think at all it is to whimper about hard luck and pine for work. They<br>have not the stuff in them to endure the horrors of idleness. And so,<br>since so much of their lives is spent in doing nothing, they suffer<br>agonies from boredom.<br><br>I was much luckier than the others, because at ten o'clock the Tramp<br>Major picked me out for the most coveted of all jobs in the spike, the<br>job of helping in the workhouse kitchen. There was not really any work to<br>be done there, and I was able to make off and hide in a shed used for<br>storing potatoes, together with some workhouse paupers who were skulking<br>to avoid the Sunday-morning service. There was a stove burning there, and<br>comfortable packing cases to sit on, and back numbers of the FAMILY<br>HERALD, and even a copy of RAFFLES from the workhouse library. It was<br>paradise after the spike.<br><br>Also, I had my dinner from the workhouse table, and it was one of the<br>biggest meals I have ever eaten. A tramp does not see such a meal twice<br>in the year, in the spike or out of it. The paupers told me that they<br>always gorged to the bursting point on Sundays, and went hungry six days<br>of the week. When the meal was over the cook set me to do the washing-up,<br>and told me to throw away. the food that remained. The wastage was<br>astonishing; great dishes of beef, and bucketfuls of broad and<br>vegetables, were pitched away. like rubbish, and then defiled with<br>tea-leaves. I filled five dustbins to overflowing with good food. And<br>while I did so my follow tramps were sitting two hundred yards away in<br>the spike, their bellies half filled with the spike dinner of the<br>everlasting bread and tea, and perhaps two cold boiled potatoes each in<br>honour of Sunday. It appeared that the food was thrown away from<br>deliberate policy, rather than that it should be given to the tramps.<br><br>At three I left the workhouse kitchen and went back to the spike. The,<br>boredom in that crowded, comfortless room was now unbearable. Even<br>smoking had ceased, for a tramp's only tobacco is picked-up cigarette<br>ends, and, like a browsing beast, he starves if he is long away from the<br>pavement-pasture. To occupy the time I talked with a rather superior<br>tramp, a young carpenter who wore a collar and tie, and was on the road,<br>he said. for lack of a set of tools. He kept a little aloof from the<br>other tramps, and held himself more like a free man than a casual. He had<br>literary tastes, too, and carried one of Scott's novels on all his<br>wanderings. He told me he never entered a spike unless driven there by<br>hunger, sleeping under hedges and behind ricks in preference. Along the<br>south coast he had begged by day and slept in bathing-machines for weeks<br>at a time.<br><br>We talked of life on the road. He criticized the system which makes a<br>tramp spend fourteen hours a day in the spike, and the other ten in<br>walking and dodging the police. He spoke of his own case--six months at<br>the public charge for want of three pounds' worth of tools. It was<br>idiotic, he said.<br><br>Then I told him about the wastage of food in the workhouse kitchen, and<br>what I thought of it. And at that he changed his tune immediately. I saw<br>that I had awakened the pew-renter who sleeps in every English workman.<br>Though he had been famished. along with the rest, he at once saw reasons<br>why the food should have been thrown away rather than given to the tramps.<br>He admonished me quite severely.<br><br>'They have to do it,' he said. 'If they made these places too pleasant<br>you'd have all the scum of the country flocking into them. It's only the<br>bad food as keeps all that scum away. These tramps are too lazy to work,<br>that's all that's wrong with them. You don't want to go encouraging of<br>them. They're scum.'<br><br>I produced arguments to prove him wrong, but he would not listen. He kept<br>repeating:<br><br>'You don't want to have any pity on these tramps--scum, they are. You<br>don't want to judge them by the same standards as men like you and me.<br>They're scum, just scum.'<br><br>It was interesting to see how subtly he disassociated himself from his<br>fellow tramps. He has been on the road six months. but in the sight of<br>God, he seemed to imply, he was not a tramp. His body might be in the<br>spike, but his spirit soared far away, in the pure aether of the middle<br>classes.<br><br>The clock's hands crept round with excruciating slowness. We were too<br>bored even to talk now, the only sound was of oaths and reverberating<br>yawns. One would force his eyes away from the clock for what seemed an<br>age, and then look back again to see that the hands had advanced three<br>minutes. Ennui clogged our souls like cold mutton fat. Our bones ached<br>because of it. The clock's hands stood at four, and supper was not<br>till six, and there was nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting<br>moon.<br><br>At last six o'clock did come, and the Tramp Major and his assistant<br>arrived with supper. The yawning tramps brisked up like lions at<br>feeding-time. But the meal was a dismal disappointment. The bread, bad<br>enough in the morning, was now positively uneatable; it was so hard that<br>even the strongest jaws could make little impression on it. The older men<br>went almost supperless, and not a man could finish. his portion, hungry<br>though most of us were. When we had finished, the blankets were served<br>out immediately, and we were hustled off once more to the bare, chilly<br>cells.<br><br>Thirteen hours went by. At seven we were awakened, and rushed forth to<br>squabble over the water in the bathroom, and bolt our ration of bread and<br>tea. Our time in the spike was up, but we could riot go until the doctor<br>had examined us again, for the authorities have a terror of smallpox and<br>its distribution by tramps. The doctor kept us waiting two hours this<br>time, and it was ten o'clock before we finally escaped.<br><br>At last it was time to go, and we were let out into the yard. How bright<br>everything looked, and how sweet the winds did blow, after the gloomy,<br>reeking spike! The Tramp Major handed each man his bundle of confiscated<br>possessions, and a hunk of bread and cheese for midday dinner, and then<br>we took the road, hastening to get out of sight of the spike and its<br>discipline, This was our interim of freedom. After a day and two nights<br>of wasted time we had eight hours or so to take our recreation, to scour<br>the roads for cigarette ends, to beg, and to look for work. Also, we had<br>to make our ten, fifteen, or it might be twenty miles to the next spike,<br>where the game would begin anew.<br><br>I disinterred my eightpence and took the road with Nobby, a respectable,<br>downhearted tramp who carried a spare pair of boots and visited all the<br>Labour Exchanges. Our late companions were scattering north, south, cast<br>and west, like bugs into a mattress. Only the imbecile loitered at the<br>spike gates, until the Tramp Major had to chase him away.<br><br>Nobby and I set out for Croydon. It was a quiet road, there were no cars<br>passing, the blossom covered the chestnut trees like great wax candles.<br>Everything was so quiet and smelt so clean, it was hard to realize that<br>only a few minutes ago we had been packed with that band of prisoners in<br>a stench of drains and soft soap. The others had all disappeared; we two<br>seemed to be the only tramps on the road.<br><br>Then I heard a hurried step behind me, and felt a tap on my arm. It was<br>little Scotty, who had run panting after us. He pulled a rusty tin box<br>from his pocket. He wore a friendly smile, like a man who is repaying an<br>obligation.<br><br>'Here y'are, mate,' he said cordially. 'I owe you some fag ends. You<br>stood me a smoke yesterday. The Tramp Major give me back my box of fag<br>ends when we come out this morning. One good turn deserves another--here<br>y'are.'<br><br>And he put four sodden, debauched. loathly cigarette ends into my hand.<br><br></font></p>
