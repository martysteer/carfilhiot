<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">When I worked in a second-hand bookshop--so easily pictured, if you<br>don't work in one, as a kind of paradise where charming old gentlemen<br>browse eternally among calf-bound folios--the thing that chiefly struck<br>me was the rarity of really bookish people. Our shop had an exceptionally<br>interesting stock, yet I doubt whether ten per cent of our customers knew<br>a good book from a bad one. First edition snobs were much commoner than<br>lovers of literature, but oriental students haggling over cheap textbooks<br>were commoner still, and vague-minded women looking for birthday presents<br>for their nephews were commonest of all.<br><br>Many of the people who came to us were of the kind who would be a<br>nuisance anywhere but have special opportunities in a bookshop. For<br>example, the dear old lady who 'wants a book for an invalid' (a very<br>common demand, that), and the other dear old lady who read such a nice<br>book in 1897 and wonders whether you can find her a copy. Unfortunately<br>she doesn't remember the title or the author's name or what the book was<br>about, but she does remember that it had a red cover. But apart from<br>these there are two well-known types of pest by whom every second-hand<br>bookshop is haunted. One is the decayed person smelling of old<br>breadcrusts who comes every day, sometimes several times a day, and tries<br>to sell you worthless books. The other is the person who orders large<br>quantities of books for which he has not the smallest intention of<br>paying. In our shop we sold nothing on credit, but we would put books<br>aside, or order them if necessary, for people who arranged to fetch them<br>away later. Scarcely half the people who ordered books from us ever came<br>back. It used to puzzle me at first. What made them do it? They would<br>come in and demand some rare and expensive book, would make us promise<br>over and over again to keep it for them, and then would vanish never to<br>return. But many of them, of course, were unmistakable paranoiacs. They<br>used to talk in a grandiose manner about themselves and tell the most<br>ingenious stories to explain how they had happened to come out of doors<br>without any money--stories which, in many cases, I am sure they<br>themselves believed. In a town like London there are always plenty of not<br>quite certifiable lunatics walking the streets, and they tend to<br>gravitate towards bookshops, because a bookshop is one of the few places<br>where you can hang about for a long time without spending any money. In<br>the end one gets to know these people almost at a glance. For all their<br>big talk there is something moth-eaten and aimless about them. Very<br>often, when we were dealing with an obvious paranoiac, we would put aside<br>the books he asked for and then put them back on the shelves the moment<br>he had gone. None of them, I noticed, ever attempted to take books away<br>without paying for them; merely to order them was enough--it gave them,<br>I suppose, the illusion that they were spending real money.<br><br>Like most second-hand bookshops we had various sidelines. We sold<br>second-hand typewriters, for instance, and also stamps--used stamps, I<br>mean. Stamp-collectors are a strange, silent, fish-like breed, of all<br>ages, but only of the male sex; women, apparently, fail to see the<br>peculiar charm of gumming bits of coloured paper into albums. We also<br>sold sixpenny horoscopes compiled by somebody who claimed to have<br>foretold the Japanese earthquake. They were in sealed envelopes and I<br>never opened one of them myself, but the people who bought them often<br>came back and told us how 'true' their horoscopes had been. (Doubtless<br>any horoscope seems 'true' if it tells you that you are highly attractive<br>to the opposite sex and your worst fault is generosity.) We did a good<br>deal of business in children's books, chiefly 'remainders'. Modern books<br>for children are rather horrible things, especially when you see them in<br>the mass. Personally I would sooner give a child a copy of Petrenius<br>Arbiter than PETER PAN, but even Barrie seems manly and wholesome<br>compared with some of his later imitators. At Christmas time we spent a<br>feverish ten days struggling with Christmas cards and calendars, which<br>are tiresome things to sell but good business while the season lasts. It<br>used to interest me to see the brutal cynicism with which Christian<br>sentiment is exploited. The touts from the Christmas card firms used to<br>come round with their catalogues as early as June. A phrase from one of<br>their invoices sticks in my memory. It was: '2 doz. Infant Jesus with<br>rabbits'.<br><br>But our principal sideline was a lending library--the usual 'twopenny<br>no-deposit' library of five or six hundred volumes, all fiction. How the<br>book thieves must love those libraries! It is the easiest crime in the<br>world to borrow a book at one shop for twopence, remove the label and<br>sell it at another shop for a shilling. Nevertheless booksellers<br>generally find that it pays them better to have a certain number of books<br>stolen (we used to lose about a dozen a month) than to frighten customers<br>away by demanding a deposit.<br><br>Our shop stood exactly on the frontier between Hampstead and Camden Town,<br>and we were frequented by all types from baronets to bus-conductors.<br>Probably our library subscribers were a fair cross-section of London's<br>reading public. It is therefore worth noting that of all the authors in<br>our library the one who 'went out' the best was--Priestley? Hemingway?<br>Walpole? Wodehouse? No, Ethel M. Dell, with Warwick Deeping a good second<br>and Jeffrey Farnol, I should say, third. Dell's novels, of course, are<br>read solely by women, but by women of all kinds and ages and not, as one<br>might expect, merely by wistful spinsters and the fat wives of<br>tobacconists. It is not true that men don't read novels, but it is true<br>that there are whole branches of fiction that they avoid. Roughly<br>speaking, what one might call the AVERAGE novel--the ordinary, good-bad,<br>Galsworthy-and-water stuff which is the norm of the English novel--seems<br>to exist only for women. Men read either the novels it is possible to<br>respect, or detective stories. But their consumption of detective stories<br>is terrific. One of our subscribers to my knowledge read four or five<br>detective stories every week for over a year, besides others which he got<br>from another library. What chiefly surprised me was that he never read<br>the same book twice. Apparently the whole of that frightful torrent of<br>trash (the pages read every year would, I calculated, cover nearly three<br>quarters of an acre) was stored for ever in his memory. He took no notice<br>of titles or author's names, but he could tell by merely glancing into a<br>book whether be had 'had it already'.<br><br>In a lending library you see people's real tastes, not their pretended<br>ones, and one thing that strikes you is how completely the 'classical'<br>English novelists have dropped out of favour. It is simply useless to put<br>Dickens, Thackeray, Jane Austen, Trollope, etc. into the ordinary lending<br>library; nobody takes them out. At the mere sight of a nineteenth-century<br>novel people say, 'Oh, but that's OLD!' and shy away immediately. Yet it<br>is always fairly easy to SELL Dickens, just as it is always easy to sell<br>Shakespeare. Dickens is one of those authors whom people are 'always<br>meaning to' read, and, like the Bible, he is widely known at second hand.<br>People know by hearsay that Bill Sikes was a burglar and that Mr Micawber<br>had a bald head, just as they know by hearsay that Moses was found in a<br>basket of bulrushes and saw the 'back parts' of the Lord. Another thing<br>that is very noticeable is the growing unpopularity of American books.<br>And another--the publishers get into a stew about this every two or<br>three years--is the unpopularity of short stories. The kind of person<br>who asks the librarian to choose a book for him nearly always starts by<br>saying 'I don't want short stories', or 'I do not desire little stories',<br>as a German customer of ours used to put it. If you ask them why, they<br>sometimes explain that it is too much fag to get used to a new set of<br>characters with every story; they like to 'get into' a novel which<br>demands no further thought after the first chapter. I believe, though,<br>that the writers are more to blame here than the readers. Most modern<br>short stories, English and American, are utterly lifeless and worthless,<br>far more so than most novels. The short stories which are stories are<br>popular enough, VIDE D. H. Lawrence, whose short stories are as popular<br>as his novels.<br><br>Would I like to be a bookseller DE MÉTIER? On the whole--in spite of my<br>employer's kindness to me, and some happy days I spent in the shop--no.<br><br>Given a good pitch and the right amount of capital, any educated person<br>ought to be able to make a small secure living out of a bookshop. Unless<br>one goes in for 'rare' books it is not a difficult trade to learn, and<br>you start at a great advantage if you know anything about the insides of<br>books. (Most booksellers don't. You can get their measure by having a<br>look at the trade papers where they advertise their wants. If you don't<br>see an ad. for Boswell's DECLINE AND FALL you are pretty sure to see one<br>for THE MILL ON THE FLOSS by T. S. Eliot.) Also it is a humane trade<br>which is not capable of being vulgarized beyond a certain point. The<br>combines can never squeeze the small independent bookseller out of<br>existence as they have squeezed the grocer and the milkman. But the hours<br>of work are very long--I was only a part-time employee, but my employer<br>put in a seventy-hour week, apart from constant expeditions out of hours<br>to buy books--and it is an unhealthy life. As a rule a bookshop is<br>horribly cold in winter, because if it is too warm the windows get misted<br>over, and a bookseller lives on his windows. And books give off more and<br>nastier dust than any other class of objects yet invented, and the top of<br>a book is the place where every bluebottle prefers to die.<br><br>But the real reason why I should not like to be in the book trade for<br>life is that while I was in it I lost my love of books. A bookseller has<br>to tell lies about books, and that gives him a distaste for them; still<br>worse is the fact that he is constantly dusting them and hauling them to<br>and fro. There was a time when I really did love books--loved the sight<br>and smell and feel of them, I mean, at least if they were fifty or more<br>years old. Nothing pleased me quite so much as to buy a job lot of them<br>for a shilling at a country auction. There is a peculiar flavour about<br>the battered unexpected books you pick up in that kind of collection:<br>minor eighteenth-century poets, out-of-date gazeteers, odd volumes of<br>forgotten novels, bound numbers of ladies' magazines of the sixties. For<br>casual reading--in your bath, for instance, or late at night when you<br>are too tired to go to bed, or in the odd quarter of an hour before lunch<br>--there is nothing to touch a back number of the Girl's Own Paper. But as<br>soon as I went to work in the bookshop I stopped buying books. Seen in<br>the mass, five or ten thousand at a time, books were boring and even<br>slightly sickening. Nowadays I do buy one occasionally, but only if it is<br>a book that I want to read and can't borrow, and I never buy junk. The<br>sweet smell of decaying paper appeals to me no longer. It is too closely<br>associated in my mind with paranoiac customers and dead bluebottles.<br><br></font></p>
