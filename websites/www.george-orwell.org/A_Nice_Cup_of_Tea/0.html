<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">If you look up 'tea' in the first cookery book that comes to hand you<br>will probably find that it is unmentioned; or at most you will find a few<br>lines of sketchy instructions which give no ruling on several ofthe most<br>important points.<br><br>This is curious, not only because tea is one of the main stays<br>ofcivilization in this country, as well as in Eire, Australia and New<br>Zealand, but because the best manner of making it is the subject<br>ofviolent disputes.<br><br>When I look through my own recipe for the perfect cup of tea, I findno<br>fewer than eleven outstanding points. On perhaps two of them there would<br>be pretty general agreement, but at least four others areacutely<br>controversial. Here are my own eleven rules, every one ofwhich I regard<br>as golden:<br><br>First of all, one should use Indian or Ceylonese tea. China teahas<br>virtues which are not to be despised nowadays--it is economical, and one<br>can drink it without milk--but there is not much stimulation in it. One<br>does not feel wiser, braver or more optimistic after drinking it. Anyone<br>who has used that comforting phrase 'a nice cup oftea' invariably means<br>Indian tea. Secondly, tea should be made in small quantities--that is,<br>in a teapot. Tea out of an urn is always tasteless, while army tea, made<br>ina cauldron, tastes of grease and whitewash. The teapot should be madeof<br>china or earthenware. Silver or Britanniaware teapots produceinferior tea<br>and enamel pots are worse; though curiously enough apewter teapot (a<br>rarity nowadays) is not so bad. Thirdly, the pot should be warmed<br>beforehand. This is better done by placing it on the hob than by the<br>usual method of swilling it outwith hot water. Fourthly, the tea should<br>be strong. For a pot holding a quart, ifyou are going to fill it nearly<br>to the brim, six heaped teaspoonswould be about right. In a time of<br>rationing, this is not an idea thatcan be realized on every day of the<br>week, but I maintain that onestrong cup of tea is better than twenty weak<br>ones. All true tea loversnot only like their tea strong, but like it a<br>little stronger witheach year that passes--a fact which is recognized in<br>the extra rationissued to old-age pensioners. Fifthly, the tea should be<br>put straight into the pot. No strainers, muslin bags or other devices to<br>imprison the tea. In some countries teapots are fitted with little<br>dangling baskets under the spout to catch the stray leaves, which are<br>supposed to be harmful. Actually one can swallow tea-leaves in<br>considerable quantities without ill effect, and if the tea is not loose<br>in the potit never infuses properly. Sixthly, one should take the teapot<br>to the kettle and not the other way about. The water should be actually<br>boiling at the moment of impact, which means that one should keep it on<br>the flame while one pours. Some people add that one should only use water<br>that has been freshly brought to the boil, but I have never noticed that<br>it makes any difference. Seventhly, after making the tea, one should stir<br>it, or better, give the pot a good shake, afterwards allowing the leaves<br>to settle. Eighthly, one should drink out of a good breakfast cup--that<br>is, the cylindrical type of cup, not the flat, shallow type. The<br>breakfastcup holds more, and with the other kind one's tea is always half<br>cold--before one has well started on it. Ninthly, one should pour the<br>cream off the milk before using itfor tea. Milk that is too creamy always<br>gives tea a sickly taste. Tenthly, one should pour tea into the cup first.<br>This is one ofthe most controversial points of all; indeed in every family<br>in Britain there are probably two schools of thought on the subject. The<br>milk-first school can bring forward some fairly strong arguments, but I<br>maintain that my own argument is unanswerable. This is that, by putting<br>the tea in first and stirring as one pours, one can exactlyregulate the<br>amount of milk whereas one is liable to put in too muchmilk if one does<br>it the other way round.<br><br>Lastly, tea--unless one is drinking it in the Russian style--should be<br>drunk WITHOUT SUGAR. I know very well that I am in aminority here.<br>But still, how can you call yourself a true tea-lover ifyou destroy<br>the flavour of your tea by putting sugar in it? It would be equally<br>reasonable to put in pepper or salt. Tea is meant to bebitter,<br>just as beer is meant to be bitter. If you sweeten it, you areno longer<br>tasting the tea, you are merely tasting the sugar; you couldmake a very<br>similar drink by dissolving sugar in plain hot water.<br><br>Some people would answer that they don't like tea in itself, that they<br>only drink it in order to be warmed and stimulated, and they need sugar<br>to take the taste away. To those misguided people I would say: Try<br>drinking tea without sugar for, say, a fortnight and it is very unlikely<br>that you will ever want to ruin your tea by sweetening it again.<br><br>These are not the only controversial points to arise in connexion with<br>tea drinking, but they are sufficient to show how subtilized the whole<br>business has become. There is also the mysterious social etiquette<br>surrounding the teapot (why is it considered vulgar to drink out of your<br>saucer, for instance?) and much might be written about the subsidiary<br>uses of tealeaves, such as telling fortunes, predicting the arrival of<br>visitors, feeding rabbits, healing burns and sweeping thecarpet. It is<br>worth paying attention to such details as warming the pot and using water<br>that is really boiling, so as to make quite sureof wringing out of one's<br>ration the twenty good, strong cups of thattwo ounces, properly handled,<br>ought to represent.<br><br></font></p>
