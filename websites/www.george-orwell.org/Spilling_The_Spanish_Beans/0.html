<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The Spanish war has probably produced a richer crop of lies than any<br>event since the Great War of 1914-18, but I honestly doubt, in spite of<br>all those hecatombs of nuns who have been raped and crucified before the<br>eyes of DAILY MAIL reporters, whether it is the pro-Fascist newspapers<br>that have done the most harm. It is the left-wing papers, the NEWS<br>CHRONICLE and the DAILY WORKER, with their far subtler methods of<br>distortion, that have prevented the British public from grasping the real<br>nature of the struggle.<br><br>The fact which these papers have so carefully obscured is that the<br>Spanish Government (including the semi-autonomous Catalan Government) is<br>far more afraid of the revolution than of the Fascists. It is now almost<br>certain that the war will end with some kind of compromise, and there is<br>even reason to doubt whether the Government, which let Bilbao fail<br>without raising a finger, wishes to be too victorious; but there is no<br>doubt whatever about the thoroughness with which it is crushing its own<br>revolutionaries. For some time past a reign of terror--forcible<br>suppression of political parties, a stifling censorship of the press,<br>ceaseless espionage and mass imprisonment without trial--has been in<br>progress. When I left Barcelona in late June the jails were bulging;<br>indeed, the regular jails had long since overflowed and the prisoners<br>were being huddled into empty shops and any other temporary dump that<br>could be found for them. But the point to notice is that the people who<br>are in prison now are not Fascists but revolutionaries; they are there<br>not because their opinions are too much to the Right, but because they<br>are too much to the Left. And the people responsible for putting them<br>there are those dreadful revolutionaries at whose very name Garvin quakes<br>in his galoshes--the Communists.<br><br>Meanwhile the war against Franco continues, but, except for the poor<br>devils in the front-line trenches, nobody in Government Spain thinks of<br>it as the real war. The real struggle is between revolution and<br>counter-revolution; between the workers who are vainly trying to hold on<br>to a little of what they won in 1936, and the Liberal-Communist bloc who<br>are so successfully taking it away from them. It is unfortunate that so<br>few people in England have yet caught up with the fact that Communism is<br>now a counter-revolutionary force; that Communists everywhere are in<br>alliance with bourgeois reformism and using the whole of their powerful<br>machinery to crush or discredit any party that shows signs of<br>revolutionary tendencies. Hence the grotesque spectacle of Communists<br>assailed as wicked 'Reds' by right-wing intellectuals who are in<br>essential agreement with them. Mr Wyndham Lewis, for instance, ought to<br>love the Communists, at least temporarily. In Spain the Communist-Liberal<br>alliance has been almost completely victorious. Of all that the Spanish<br>workers won for themselves in 1936 nothing solid remains, except for a<br>few collective farms and a certain amount of land seized by the peasants<br>last year; and presumably even the peasants will be sacrificed later,<br>when there is no longer any need to placate them. To see how the present<br>situation arose, one has got to look back to the origins of the civil<br>war.<br><br>Franco's bid for power differed from those of Hitler and Mussolini in<br>that it was a military insurrection, comparable to a foreign invasion,<br>and therefore had not much mass backing, though Franco has since been<br>trying to acquire one. Its chief supporters, apart from certain sections<br>of Big Business, were the land-owning aristocracy and the huge, parasitic<br>Church. Obviously a rising of this kind will array against it various<br>forces which are not in agreement on any other point. The peasant and the<br>worker hate feudalism and clericalism; but so does the 'liberal'<br>bourgeois, who is not in the least opposed to a more modern version of<br>Fascism, at least so long as it isn't called Fascism. The 'liberal'<br>bourgeois is genuinely liberal up to the point where his own interests<br>stop. He stands for the degree of progress implied in the phrase 'la<br>carrière ouverte aux talents'. For clearly he has no chance to develop in<br>a feudal society where the worker and the peasant are too poor to buy<br>goods, where industry is burdened with huge taxes to pay for bishops'<br>vestments, and where every lucrative job is given as a matter of course<br>to the friend of the catamite of the duke's illegitimate son. Hence, in<br>the face of such a blatant reactionary as Franco, you get for a while a<br>situation in which the worker and the bourgeois, in reality deadly<br>enemies, are fighting side by side. This uneasy alliance is known as the<br>Popular Front (or, in the Communist press, to give it a spuriously<br>democratic appeal, People's Front). It is a combination with about as<br>much vitality, and about as much right to exist, as a pig with two heads<br>or some other Barnum and Bailey monstrosity.<br><br>In any serious emergency the contradiction implied in the Popular Front<br>is bound to make itself felt. For even when the worker and the bourgeois<br>are both fighting against Fascism, they are not fighting for the same<br>things; the bourgeois is fighting for bourgeois democracy, i.e.<br>capitalism, the worker, in so far as he understands the issue, for<br>Socialism. And in the early days of the revolution the Spanish workers<br>understood the issue very well. In the areas where Fascism was defeated<br>they did not content themselves with driving the rebellious troops out of<br>the towns; they also took the opportunity of seizing land and factories<br>and setting up the rough beginnings of a workers' government by means of<br>local committees, workers' militias, police forces, and so forth. They<br>made the mistake, however (possibly because most of the active<br>revolutionaries were Anarchists with a mistrust of all parliaments), of<br>leaving the Republican Government in nominal control. And, in spite of<br>various changes in personnel, every subsequent Government had been of<br>approximately the same bourgeois-reformist character. At the beginning<br>this seemed not to matter, because the Government, especially in<br>Catalonia, was almost powerless and the bourgeoisie had to lie low or<br>even (this was still happening when I reached Spain in December) to<br>disguise themselves as workers. Later, as power slipped from the hands of<br>the Anarchists into the hands of the Communists and right-wing<br>Socialists, the Government was able to reassert itself, the bourgeoisie<br>came out of hiding and the old division of society into rich and poor<br>reappeared, not much modified. Henceforward every move, except a few<br>dictated by military emergency, was directed towards undoing the work of<br>the first few months of revolution. Out of the many illustrations I could<br>choose, I will cite only one, the breaking-up of the old workers'<br>militias, which were organized on a genuinely democratic system, with<br>officers and men receiving the same pay and mingling on terms of complete<br>equality, and the substitution of the Popular Army (once again, in<br>Communist jargon, 'People's Army'), modelled as far as possible on an<br>ordinary bourgeois army, with a privileged officer-caste, immense<br>differences of pay, etc. etc. Needless to say, this is given out as a<br>military necessity, and almost certainly it does make for military<br>efficiency, at least for a short period. But the undoubted purpose of the<br>change was to strike a blow at equalitarianism. In every department the<br>same policy has been followed, with the result that only a year after the<br>outbreak of war and revolution you get what is in effect an ordinary<br>bourgeois State, with, in addition, a reign of terror to preserve the<br>status quo.<br><br>This process would probably have gone less far if the struggle could have<br>taken place without foreign interference. But the military weakness of<br>the Government made this impossible. In the face of France's foreign<br>mercenaries they were obliged to turn to Russia for help, and though the<br>quantity of arms sup--plied by Russia has been greatly exaggerated (in my<br>first three months in Spain I saw only one Russian weapon, a solitary<br>machine-gun), the mere fact of their arrival brought the Communists into<br>power. To begin with, the Russian aeroplanes and guns, and the good<br>military qualities of the international Brigades (not necessarily<br>Communist but under Communist control), immensely raised the Communist<br>prestige. But, more important, since Russia and Mexico were the only<br>countries openly supplying arms, the Russians were able not only to get<br>money for their weapons, but to extort terms as well. Put in their<br>crudest form, the terms were: 'Crush the revolution or you get no more<br>arms.' The reason usually given for the Russian attitude is that if<br>Russia appeared to be abetting the revolution, the Franco-Soviet pact<br>(and the hoped-for alliance with Great Britain) would be imperilled; it<br>may be, also, that the spectacle of a genuine revolution in Spain would<br>rouse unwanted echoes in Russia. The Communists, of course, deny that any<br>direct pressure has been exerted by the Russian Government. But this,<br>even if true, is hardly relevant, for the Communist Parties of all<br>countries can be taken as carrying out Russian policy; and it is certain<br>that the Spanish Communist Party, plus the right-wing Socialists whom<br>they control, plus the Communist press of the whole world, have used all<br>their immense and ever-increasing influence upon the side of<br>counter-revolution.<br><br><br><br>In the first half of this article I suggested that the real struggle in<br>Spain, on the Government side, has been between revolution and<br>counter-revolution; that the Government, though anxious enough to avoid<br>being beaten by Franco, has been even more anxious to undo the<br>revolutionary changes with which the outbreak of war was accompanied.<br><br>Any Communist would reject this suggestion as mistaken or wilfully<br>dishonest. He would tell you that it is nonsense to talk of the Spanish<br>Government crushing the revolution, because the revolution never<br>happened; and that our job at present is to defeat Fascism and defend<br>democracy. And in this connexion it is most important to see just how the<br>Communist anti-revolutionary propaganda works. It is a mistake to think<br>that this has no relevance in England, where the Communist Party is small<br>and comparatively weak. We shall see its relevance quickly enough if<br>England enters into an alliance with the U.S.S.R.; or perhaps even<br>earlier, for the influence of the Communist Party is bound to increase--<br>visibly is increasing--as more and more of the capitalist class realize<br>that latter-day Communism is playing their game.<br><br>Broadly speaking, Communist propaganda depends upon terrifying people<br>with the (quite real) horrors of Fascism. It also involves pretending--<br>not in so many words, but by implication--that Fascism has nothing to do<br>with capitalism. Fascism is just a kind of meaningless wickedness, an<br>aberration, 'mass sadism', the sort of thing that would happen if you<br>suddenly let loose an asylumful of homicidal maniacs. Present Fascism in<br>this form, and you can mobilize public opinion against it, at any rate<br>for a while, without provoking any revolutionary movement. You can oppose<br>Fascism by bourgeois 'democracy, meaning capitalism. But meanwhile you<br>have got to get rid of the troublesome person who points out that Fascism<br>and bourgeois 'democracy' are Tweedledum and Tweedledee. You do it at the<br>beginning by calling him an impracticable visionary. You tell him that he<br>is confusing the issue, that he is splitting the anti-Fascist forces,<br>that this is not the moment for revolutionary phrase-mongering, that for<br>the moment we have got to fight against Fascism without inquiring too<br>closely what we are fighting for. Later, if he still refuses to shut up,<br>you change your tune and call him a traitor. More exactly, you call him a<br>Trotskyist.<br><br>And what is a Trotskyist? This terrible word--in Spain at this moment<br>you can be thrown into jail and kept there indefinitely, without trial,<br>on the mere rumour that you are a Trotskyist--is only beginning to be<br>bandied to and fro in England. We shall be hearing more of it later. The<br>word 'Trotskyist' (or 'Trotsky-Fascist') is generally used to mean a<br>disguised Fascist who poses as an ultra-revolutionary in order to split<br>the left-wing forces. But it derives its peculiar power from the fact<br>that it means three separate things. It can mean one who, like Trotsky,<br>wished for world revolution; or a member of the actual organization of<br>which Trotsky is head (the only legitimate use of the word); or the<br>disguised Fascist already mentioned. The three meanings can be telescoped<br>one into the other at will. Meaning No. I may or may not carry with it<br>meaning No. 2, and meaning No. 2 almost invariably carries with it<br>meaning No. 3. Thus: 'XY has been heard to speak favourably of world<br>revolution; therefore he is a Trotskyist; therefore he is a Fascist.' In<br>Spain, to some extent even in England, ANYONE professing revolutionary<br>Socialism (i.e. professing the things the Communist Party professed until<br>a few years ago) is under suspicion of being a Trotskyist in the pay of<br>Franco or Hitler.<br><br>The accusation is a very subtle one, because in any given case, unless<br>one happened to know the contrary, it might be true. A Fascist spy<br>probably WOULD disguise himself as a revolutionary. In Spain, everyone<br>whose opinions are to the Left of those of the Communist Party is sooner<br>or later discovered to be a Trotskyist or, at least, a traitor. At the<br>beginning of the war the POUM, an opposition Communist party roughly<br>corresponding to the English ILP., was an accepted party and supplied a<br>minister to the Catalan Government, later it was expelled from the<br>Government; then it was denounced as Trotskyist; then it was suppressed,<br>every member that the police could lay their hands on being flung into<br>jail.<br><br>Until a few months ago the Anarcho-Syndicalists were described as<br>'working loyally' beside the Communists. Then the Anarcho-Syndicalists<br>were levered out of the Government; then it appeared that they were not<br>working so loyally; now they are in the process of becoming traitors.<br>After that will come the turn of the left-wing Socialists. Caballero, the<br>left-wing Socialist ex-premier, until May 1937 the idol of the Communist<br>press, is already in outer darkness, a Trotskyist and 'enemy of the<br>people'. And so the game continues. The logical end is a régime in which<br>every opposition party and newspaper is suppressed and every dissentient<br>of any importance is in jail. Of course, such a régime will be Fascism.<br>It will not be the same as the fascism Franco would impose, it will even<br>be better than Franco's fascism to the extent of being worth fighting<br>for, but it will be Fascism. Only, being operated by Communists and<br>Liberals, it will be called something different.<br><br>Meanwhile, can the war be won? The Communist influence has been against<br>revolutionary chaos and has therefore, apart from the Russian aid, tended<br>to produce greater military efficiency. If the Anarchists saved the<br>Government from August to October 1936, the Communists have saved it from<br>October onwards. But in organizing the defence they have succeeded in<br>killing enthusiasm (inside Spain, not outside). They made a militarized<br>conscript army possible, but they also made it necessary. It is<br>significant that as early as January of this year voluntary recruiting<br>had practically ceased. A revolutionary army can sometimes win by<br>enthusiasm, but a conscript army has got to win with weapons, and it is<br>unlikely that the Government will ever have a large preponderance of arms<br>unless France intervenes or unless Germany and Italy decide to make off<br>with the Spanish colonies and leave Franco in the lurch. On the whole, a<br>deadlock seems the likeliest thing.<br><br>And does the Government seriously intend to win? It does not intend to<br>lose, that is certain. On the other hand, an outright victory, with<br>Franco in flight and the Germans and Italians driven into the sea, would<br>raise difficult problems, some of them too obvious to need mentioning.<br>There is no real evidence and one can only judge by the event, but I<br>suspect that what the Government is playing for is a compromise that<br>would leave the war situation essentially in being. All prophecies are<br>wrong, therefore this one will be wrong, but I will take a chance and say<br>that though the war may end quite soon or may drag on for years, it will<br>end with Spain divided up, either by actual frontiers or into economic<br>zones. Of course, such a compromise might be claimed as a victory by<br>either side, or by both.<br><br>All that I have said in this article would seem entirely commonplace in<br>Spain, or even in France. Yet in England, in spite of the intense<br>interest the Spanish war has aroused, there are very few people who have<br>even heard of the enormous struggle that is going on behind the<br>Government lines. Of course, this is no accident. There has been a quite<br>deliberate conspiracy (I could give detailed instances) to prevent the<br>Spanish situation from being understood. People who ought to know better<br>have lent themselves to the deception on the ground that if you tell the<br>truth about Spain it will be used as Fascist propaganda.<br><br>It is easy to see where such cowardice leads. If the British public had<br>been given a truthful account of the Spanish war they would have had an<br>opportunity of learning what Fascism is and how it can be combated. As it<br>is, the News Chronicle version of Fascism as a kind of homicidal mania<br>peculiar to Colonel Blimps bombinating in the economic void has been<br>established more firmly than ever. And thus we are one step nearer to the<br>great war 'against Fascism' (cf. 1914, 'against militarism') which will<br>allow Fascism, British variety, to be slipped over our necks during the<br>first week.<br><br></font></p>
