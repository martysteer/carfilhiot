<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Since Charles Reade's books are published in cheap editions one can<br>assume that he still has his following, but it is unusual to meet anyone<br>who has voluntarily read him. In most people his name seems to evoke, at<br>most, a vague memory of 'doing' THE CLOISTER AND THE HEARTH as a school<br>holiday task. It is his bad luck to be remembered by this particular<br>book, rather as Mark Twain, thanks to the films, is chiefly remembered by<br>A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT. Reade wrote several dull<br>books, and THE CLOISTER AND THE HEARTH is one of them. But he also wrote<br>three novels which I personally would back to outlive the entire works of<br>Meredith and George Eliot, besides some brilliant long-short stories such<br>as A JACK OF ALL TRADES and THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A THIEF.<br><br>What is the attraction of Reade? At bottom it is the same charm as one<br>finds in R. Austin Freeman's detective stories or Lieutenant-Commander<br>Gould's collections of curiosities--the charm of useless knowledge.<br>Reade was a man of what one might call penny-encyclopaedic learning. He<br>possessed vast stocks of disconnected information which a lively<br>narrative gift allowed him to cram into books which would at any rate<br>pass as novels. If you have the sort of mind that takes a pleasure in<br>dates, lists, catalogues, concrete details, descriptions of processes,<br>junk-shop windows and back numbers of the EXCHANGE AND MART, the sort of<br>mind that likes knowing exactly how a medieval catapult worked or just<br>what objects a prison cell of the eighteen-forties contained, then you<br>can hardly help enjoying Reade. He himself, of course, did not see his<br>work in quite this light. He prided himself on his accuracy and compiled<br>his books largely from newspaper cuttings, but the strange facts which he<br>collected were subsidiary to what he would have regarded as his<br>'purpose'. For he was a social reformer in a fragmentary way, and made<br>vigorous attacks on such diverse evils as blood-letting, the treadmill,<br>private asylums, clerical celibacy and tight-lacing.<br><br>My own favourite has always been FOUL PLAY, which as it happens is not an<br>attack on anything in particular. Like most nineteenth-century novels<br>FOUL PLAY is too complicated to be summarized, but its central story is<br>that of a young clergyman, Robert Penfold, who is unjustly convicted of<br>forgery, is transported to Australia, absconds in disguise, and is<br>wrecked on a desert island together with the heroine. Here, of course,<br>Reade is in his element. Of all men who ever lived, he was the best<br>fitted to write a desert-island story. Some desert-island stories, of<br>course, are worse than others, but none is altogether bad when it sticks<br>to the actual concrete details of the struggle to keep alive. A list of<br>the objects in a shipwrecked man's possession is probably the surest<br>winner in fiction, surer even than a trial scene. Nearly thirty years<br>after reading the book I can still remember more or less exactly what<br>things the three heroes of Ballantyne's CORAL ISLAND possessed between<br>them. (A telescope, six yards of whipcord, a penknife, a brass ring and a<br>piece of hoop iron.) Even a dismal book like ROBINSON CRUSOE, so<br>unreadable as a whole that few people even know that the second part<br>exists, becomes interesting when it describes Crusoe's efforts to make a<br>table, glaze earthenware and grow a patch of wheat. Reade, however, was<br>an expert on desert islands, or at any rate he was very well up in the<br>geography textbooks of the time. Moreover he was the kind of man who<br>would have been at home on a desert island himself. He would never, like<br>Crusoe, have been stumped by such an easy problem as that of leavening<br>bread and, unlike Ballantyne, he knew that civilized men cannot make fire<br>by rubbing sticks together.<br><br>The hero of FOUL PLAY, like most of Reade's heroes, is a kind of<br>superman. He is hero, saint, scholar, gentleman, athlete, pugilist,<br>navigator, physiologist, botanist, blacksmith and carpenter all rolled<br>into one, the sort of compendium of all the talents that Reade honestly<br>imagined to be the normal product of an English university. Needless to<br>say, it is only a month or two before this wonderful clergyman has got<br>the desert island running like a West End hotel. Even before reaching the<br>island, when the last survivors of the wrecked ship are dying of thirst<br>in an open boat, he has shown his ingenuity by constructing a distilling<br>apparatus with a jar, a hot-water bottle and a piece of tubing. But his<br>best stroke of all is the way in which he contrives to leave the island.<br>He himself, with a price on his head, would be glad enough to remain, but<br>the heroine, Helen Rollestone, who has no idea that he is a convict, is<br>naturally anxious to escape. She asks Robert to turn his 'great mind' to<br>this problem. The first difficulty, of course, is to discover exactly<br>where the island is. Luckily, however, Helen is still wearing her watch,<br>which is still keeping Sydney time. By fixing a stick in the ground and<br>watching its shadow Robert notes the exact moment of noon, after which it<br>is a simple matter to work out the longitude--for naturally a man of his<br>calibre would know the longitude of Sydney. It is equally natural that he<br>can determine the latitude within a degree or two by the nature of the<br>vegetation. But the next difficulty is to send a message to the outside<br>world. After some thought Robert writes a series of messages on pieces of<br>parchment made from seals' bladders, with ink obtained from cochineal<br>insects. He has noticed that migrant birds often use the island as a<br>stopping-place, and he fixes on ducks as the likeliest messengers,<br>because every duck is liable to be shot sooner or later. By a stratagem<br>often used in India he captures a number of ducks, ties a message to each<br>of their legs and lets them go. Finally, of course, one of the ducks<br>takes refuge on a ship, and the couple are rescued, but even then the<br>story is barely half finished. There follow enormous ramifications, plots<br>and counterplots, intrigues, triumphs and disasters, ending with the<br>vindication of Robert, and wedding bells.<br><br>In any of Reade's three best books, FOUL PLAY, HARD CASH and IT IS NEVER<br>TOO LATE TO MEND, it is not fair to say that the sole interest is in the<br>technical detail. His power of descriptive writing, especially of<br>describing violent action, is also very striking, and on a serial-story<br>level he is a wonderful contriver of plots. Simply as a novelist it is<br>impossible to take him seriously, because he has no sense whatever of<br>character or of probability, but he himself had the advantage of<br>believing in even the absurdest details of his own stories. He wrote of<br>life as he saw it, and many Victorians saw it in the same way: that is,<br>as a series of tremendous melodramas, with virtue triumphant every time.<br>Of all the nineteenth-century novelists who have remained readable, he is<br>perhaps the only one who is completely in tune with his own age. For all<br>his unconventionality, his 'purpose', his eagerness to expose abuses, he<br>never makes a fundamental criticism. Save for a few surface evils he sees<br>nothing wrong in an acquisitive society, with its equation of money and<br>virtue, its pious millionaires and erastian clergymen. Perhaps nothing<br>gives one his measure better than the fact that in introducing Robert<br>Penfold, at the beginning of FOUL PLAY, he mentions that he is a scholar<br>and a cricketer and only thirdly and almost casually adds that he is a<br>priest.<br><br>That is not to say that Reade's social conscience was not sound so far as<br>it went, and in several minor ways he probably helped to educate public<br>opinion. His attack on the prison system in IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND<br>is relevant to this day, or was so till very recently, and in his medical<br>theories he is said to have been a long way ahead of his time. What he<br>lacked was any notion that the early railway age, with the special scheme<br>of values appropriate to it, was not going to last for ever. This is a<br>little surprising when one remembers that he was the brother of Winwood<br>Reade. However hastily and unbalanced Winwood Reade's MARTYRDOM OF MAN<br>may seem now, it is a book that shows an astonishing width of vision, and<br>it is probably the unacknowledged grandparent of the 'outlines' so<br>popular today. Charles Reade might have written an 'outline' of<br>phrenology, cabinet-making or the habits of whales, but not of human<br>history. He was simply a middle-class gentleman with a little more<br>conscience than most, a scholar who happened to prefer popular science to<br>the classics. Just for that reason he is one of the best 'escape'<br>novelists we have. FOUL PLAY and HARD CASH would be good books to send to<br>a soldier enduring the miseries of trench warfare, for instance. There<br>are no problems in them, no genuine 'messages', merely the fascination of<br>a gifted mind functioning within very narrow limits, and offering as<br>complete a detachment from real life as a game of chess or a jigsaw<br>puzzle.<br><br></font></p>
