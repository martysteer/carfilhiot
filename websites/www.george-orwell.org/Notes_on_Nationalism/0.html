<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Somewhere or other Byron makes use of the French word LONGEUR, and<br>remarks in passing that though in England we happen not to have the WORD,<br>we have the THING in considerable profusion. In the same way, there is a<br>habit of mind which is now so widespread that it affects our thinking on<br>nearly every subject, but which has not yet been given a name. As the<br>nearest existing equivalent I have chosen the word 'nationalism', but it<br>will be seen in a moment that I am not using it in quite the ordinary<br>sense, if only because the emotion I am speaking about does not always<br>attach itself to what is called a nation--that is, a single race or a<br>geographical area. It can attach itself to a church or a class, or it may<br>work in a merely negative sense, AGAINST something or other and without<br>the need for any positive object of loyalty.<br><br>By 'nationalism' I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human<br>beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions<br>or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled 'good' or<br>'bad'.[See note, below] But secondly--and this is much more important--I mean<br>the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing<br>it beyond good and evil and recognising no other duty than that of<br>advancing its interests. Nationalism is not to be confused with<br>patriotism. Both words are normally used in so vague a way that any<br>definition is liable to be challenged, but one must draw a distinction<br>between them, since two different and even opposing ideas are involved.<br>By 'patriotism' I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular<br>way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no<br>wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive,<br>both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is<br>inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every<br>nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, NOT for himself<br>but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own<br>individuality.<br><br><br>[Note: Nations, and even vaguer entities such as Catholic Church or the<br>proleteriat, are commonly thought of as individuals and often referred to<br>as 'she'. Patently absurd remarks such as 'Germany is naturally<br>treacherous' are to be found in any newspaper one opens and reckless<br>generalization about national character ('The Spaniard is a natural<br>aristocrat' or 'Every Englishman is a hypocrite') are uttered by almost<br>everyone. Intermittently these generalizations are seen to be unfounded,<br>but the habit of making them persists, and people of professedly<br>international outlook, e.g., Tolstoy or Bernard Shaw, are often guilty of<br>them. (Author's footnote)]<br><br><br>So long as it is applied merely to the more notorious and identifiable<br>nationalist movements in Germany, Japan, and other countries, all this is<br>obvious enough. Confronted with a phenomenon like Nazism, which we can<br>observe from the outside, nearly all of us would say much the same things<br>about it. But here I must repeat what I said above, that I am only using<br>the word 'nationalism' for lack of a better. Nationalism, in the extended<br>sense in which I am using the word, includes such movements and<br>tendencies as Communism, political Catholicism, Zionism, Antisemitism,<br>Trotskyism and Pacifism. It does not necessarily mean loyalty to a<br>government or a country, still less to ONE'S OWN country, and it is not<br>even strictly necessary that the units in which it deals should actually<br>exist. To name a few obvious examples, Jewry, Islam, Christendom, the<br>Proletariat and the White Race are all of them objects of passionate<br>nationalistic feeling: but their existence can be seriously questioned,<br>and there is no definition of any one of them that would be universally<br>accepted.<br><br>It is also worth emphasising once again that nationalist feeling can be<br>purely negative. There are, for example, Trotskyists who have become<br>simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding loyalty<br>to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature<br>of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist<br>is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He<br>may be a positive or a negative nationalist--that is, he may use his<br>mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating--but at any rate his<br>thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He<br>sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and<br>decline of great power units, and every event that happens seems to him a<br>demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is<br>on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism<br>with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the<br>principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary,<br>having picked his side, he persuades himself that it IS the strongest,<br>and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly<br>against him. Nationalism is power-hunger tempered by self-deception.<br>Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty, but he is<br>also--since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself--<br>unshakeably certain of being in the right.<br><br>Now that I have given this lengthy definition, I think it will be<br>admitted that the habit of mind I am talking about is widespread among<br>the English intelligentsia, and more widespread there than among the mass<br>of the people. For those who feel deeply about contemporary politics,<br>certain topics have become so infected by considerations of prestige that<br>a genuinely rational approach to them is almost impossible. Out of the<br>hundreds of examples that one might choose, take this question: Which of<br>the three great allies, the U.S.S.R., Britain and the USA, has<br>contributed most to the defeat of Germany? In theory, it should be<br>possible to give a reasoned and perhaps even a conclusive answer to this<br>question. In practice, however, the necessary calculations cannot be<br>made, because anyone likely to bother his head about such a question<br>would inevitably see it in terms of competitive prestige. He would<br>therefore START by deciding in favour of Russia, Britain or America as<br>the case might be, and only AFTER this would begin searching for<br>arguments that seemed to support his case. And there are whole strings of<br>kindred questions to which you can only get an honest answer from someone<br>who is indifferent to the whole subject involved, and whose opinion on it<br>is probably worthless in any case. Hence, partly, the remarkable failure<br>in our time of political and military prediction. It is curious to<br>reflect that out of al the 'experts' of all the schools, there was not a<br>single one who was able to foresee so likely an event as the Russo-German<br>Pact of 1939.[Note 1, below] And when news of the Pact broke, the most wildly<br>divergent explanations were of it were given, and predictions were made<br>which were falsified almost immediately, being based in nearly every case<br>not on a study of probabilities but on a desire to make the U.S.S.R. seem<br>good or bad, strong or weak. Political or military commentators, like<br>astrologers, can survive almost any mistake, because their more devoted<br>followers do not look to them for an appraisal of the facts but for the<br>stimulation of nationalistic loyalties.[Note 2, below] And aesthetic judgements,<br>especially literary judgements, are often corrupted in the same way as<br>political ones. It would be difficult for an Indian Nationalist to enjoy<br>reading Kipling or for a Conservative to see merit in Mayakovsky, and<br>there is always a temptation to claim that any book whose tendency one<br>disagrees with must be a bad book from a LITERARY point of view. People<br>of strongly nationalistic outlook often perform this sleight of hand<br>without being conscious of dishonesty.<br><br><br>[Note 1: A few writers of conservative tendency, such as Peter Drucker,<br>foretold an agreement between Germany and Russia, but they expected an<br>actual alliance or amalgamation which would be permanent. No Marxist or<br>other left-wing writer, of whatever colour, came anywhere near<br>foretelling the Pact.(Author's footnote)]<br><br><br>[Note 2: The military commentators of the popular press can mostly be<br>classified as pro-Russian or anti-Russianm pro-blimp or anti-blimp. Such<br>errors as believing the Mrginot Line impregnable, or predicting that<br>Russia would conquer Germany in three months, have failed to shake their<br>reputation, because they were always saying what their own particular<br>audience wanted to hear. The two military critics most favoured by the<br>intelligentsia are Captain Liddell Hart and Major-General Fuller, the<br>first of whom teachs that the defence is stronger that the attack, and<br>the second that the attack is stronger that the defence. This<br>contradiction has not prevented both of them from being accepted as<br>authorities by the sme public. The secret reason for their vogue in<br>left-wing circles is that both of them are at odds with the War Office.<br>(Author's footnote)]<br><br><br>In England, if one simply considers the number of people involved, it is<br>probable that the dominant form of nationalism is old-fashioned British<br>jingoism. It is certain that this is still widespread, and much more so<br>than most observers would have believed a dozen years ago. However, in<br>this essay I am concerned chiefly with the reactions of the<br>intelligentsia, among whom jingoism and even patriotism of the old kind<br>are almost dead, though they now seem to be reviving among a minority.<br>Among the intelligentsia, it hardly needs saying that the dominant form<br>of nationalism is Communism--using this word in a very loose sense, to<br>include not merely Communist Party members, but 'fellow travellers' and<br>russophiles generally. A Communist, for my purpose here, is one who looks<br>upon the U.S.S.R. as his Fatherland and feels it his duty t justify<br>Russian policy and advance Russian interests at all costs. Obviously such<br>people abound in England today, and their direct and indirect influence<br>is very great. But many other forms of nationalism also flourish, and it<br>is by noticing the points of resemblance between different and even<br>seemingly opposed currents of thought that one can best get the matter<br>into perspective.<br><br>Ten or twenty years ago, the form of nationalism most closely<br>corresponding to Communism today was political Catholicism. Its most<br>outstanding exponent--though he was perhaps an extreme case rather than<br>a typical one--was G. K. Chesterton. Chesterton was a writer of<br>considerable talent who whose to suppress both his sensibilities and his<br>intellectual honesty in the cause of Roman Catholic propaganda. During<br>the last twenty years or so of his life, his entire output was in reality<br>an endless repetition of the same thing, under its laboured cleverness as<br>simple and boring as 'Great is Diana of the Ephesians.' Every book that<br>he wrote, every scrap of dialogue, had to demonstrate beyond the<br>possibility of mistake the superiority of the Catholic over the<br>Protestant or the pagan. But Chesterton was not content to think of this<br>superiority as merely intellectual or spiritual: it had to be translated<br>into terms of national prestige and military power, which entailed an<br>ignorant idealisation of the Latin countries, especially France.<br>Chesterton had not lived long in France, and his picture of it--as a<br>land of Catholic peasants incessantly singing the MARSEILLAISE over<br>glasses of red wine--had about as much relation to reality as CHU CHIN<br>CHOW has to everyday life in Baghdad. And with this went not only an<br>enormous overestimation of French military power (both before and after<br>1914-18 he maintained that France, by itself, was stronger than Germany),<br>but a silly and vulgar glorification of the actual process of war.<br>Chesterton's battle poems, such as Lepanto or The Ballad of Saint<br>Barbara, make The Charge of the Light Brigade read like a pacifist tract:<br>they are perhaps the most tawdry bits of bombast to be found in our<br>language. The interesting thing is that had the romantic rubbish which he<br>habitually wrote about France and the French army been written by<br>somebody else about Britain and the British army, he would have been the<br>first to jeer. In home politics he was a Little Englander, a true hater<br>of jingoism and imperialism, and according to his lights a true friend of<br>democracy. Yet when he looked outwards into the international field, he<br>could forsake his principles without even noticing he was doing so. Thus,<br>his almost mystical belief in the virtues of democracy did not prevent<br>him from admiring Mussolini. Mussolini had destroyed the representative<br>government and the freedom of the press for which Chesterton had<br>struggled so hard at home, but Mussolini was an Italian and had made<br>Italy strong, and that settled the matter. Nor did Chesterton ever find a<br>word to say about imperialism and the conquest of coloured races when<br>they were practised by Italians or Frenchmen. His hold on reality, his<br>literary taste, and even to some extent his moral sense, were dislocated<br>as soon as his nationalistic loyalties were involved.<br><br>Obviously there are considerable resemblances between political<br>Catholicism, as exemplified by Chesterton, and Communism. So there are<br>between either of these and for instance Scottish nationalism, Zionism,<br>Antisemitism or Trotskyism. It would be an oversimplification to say that<br>all forms of nationalism are the same, even in their mental atmosphere,<br>but there are certain rules that hold good in all cases. The following<br>are the principal characteristics of nationalist thought:<br><br>OBSESSION. As nearly as possible, no nationalist ever thinks, talks, or<br>writes about anything except the superiority of his own power unit. It is<br>difficult if not impossible for any nationalist to conceal his<br>allegiance. The smallest slur upon his own unit, or any implied praise of<br>a rival organization, fills him with uneasiness which he can relieve only<br>by making some sharp retort. If the chosen unit is an actual country,<br>such as Ireland or India, he will generally claim superiority for it not<br>only in military power and political virtue, but in art, literature,<br>sport, structure of the language, the physical beauty of the inhabitants,<br>and perhaps even in climate, scenery and cooking. He will show great<br>sensitiveness about such things as the correct display of flags, relative<br>size of headlines and the order in which different countries are<br>named.[Note, below] Nomenclature plays a very important part in nationalist<br>thought. Countries which have won their independence or gone through a<br>nationalist revolution usually change their names, and any country or<br>other unit round which strong feelings revolve is likely to have several<br>names, each of them carrying a different implication. The two sides of<br>the Spanish Civil War had between them nine or ten names expressing<br>different degrees of love and hatred. Some of these names (e.g.<br>'Patriots' for Franco-supporters, or 'Loyalists' for<br>Government-supporters) were frankly question-begging, and there was no<br>single one of the which the two rival factions could have agreed to use.<br>All nationalists consider it a duty to spread their own language to the<br>detriment of rival languages, and among English-speakers this struggle<br>reappears in subtler forms as a struggle between dialects.<br>Anglophobe-Americans will refuse to use a slang phrase if they know it to<br>be of British origin, and the conflict between Latinizers and Germanizers<br>often has nationalists motives behind it. Scottish nationalists insist on<br>the superiority of Lowland Scots, and socialists whose nationalism takes<br>the form of class hatred tirade against the B.B.C. accent and even the<br>often gives the impression of being tinged by belief in symphatetic magic<br>--a belief which probably comes out in the widespread custom of burning<br>political enemies in effigy, or using pictures of them as targets in<br>shooting galleries.<br><br><br>[Note: Certain Americans have expressed dissatisfaction because<br>'Anglo-American' is the form of combination for these two words. It has<br>been proposed to submite 'Americo-British'.(Author's footnote)]<br><br><br>INSTABILITY. The intensity with which they are held does not prevent<br>nationalist loyalties from being transferable. To begin with, as I have<br>pointed out already, they can be and often are fastened up on some<br>foreign country. One quite commonly finds that great national leaders, or<br>the founders of nationalist movements, do not even belong to the country<br>they have glorified. Sometimes they are outright foreigners, or more<br>often they come from peripheral areas where nationality is doubtful.<br>Examples are Stalin, Hitler, Napoleon, de Valera, Disraeli, Poincare,<br>Beaverbrook. The Pan-German movement was in part the creation of an<br>Englishman, Houston Chamberlain. For the past fifty or a hundred years,<br>transferred nationalism has been a common phenomenon among literary<br>intellectuals. With Lafcadio Hearne the transference was to Japan, with<br>Carlyle and many others of his time to Germany, and in our own age it is<br>usually to Russia. But the peculiarly interesting fact is that<br>re-transference is also possible. A country or other unit which has been<br>worshipped for years may suddenly become detestable, and some other<br>object of affection may take its place with almost no interval. In the<br>first version of H. G. Wells's OUTLINE OF HISTORY, and others of his<br>writings about that time, one finds the United States praised almost as<br>extravagantly as Russia is praised by Communists today: yet within a few<br>years this uncritical admiration had turned into hostility. The bigoted<br>Communist who changes in a space of weeks, or even days, into an equally<br>bigoted Trotskyist is a common spectacle. In continental Europe Fascist<br>movements were largely recruited from among Communists, and the opposite<br>process may well happen within the next few years. What remains constant<br>in the nationalist is his state of mind: the object of his feelings is<br>changeable, and may be imaginary.<br><br>But for an intellectual, transference has an important function which I<br>have already mentioned shortly in connection with Chesterton. It makes it<br>possible for him to be much MORE nationalistic--more vulgar, more silly,<br>more malignant, more dishonest--that he could ever be on behalf of his<br>native country, or any unit of which he had real knowledge. When one sees<br>the slavish or boastful rubbish that is written about Stalin, the Red<br>Army, etc. by fairly intelligent and sensitive people, one realises that<br>this is only possible because some kind of dislocation has taken place.<br>In societies such as ours, it is unusual for anyone describable as an<br>intellectual to feel a very deep attachment to his own country. Public<br>opinion--that is, the section of public opinion of which he as an<br>intellectual is aware--will not allow him to do so. Most of the people<br>surrounding him are sceptical and disaffected, and he may adopt the same<br>attitude from imitativeness or sheer cowardice: in that case he will have<br>abandoned the form of nationalism that lies nearest to hand without<br>getting any closer to a genuinely internationalist outlook. He still<br>feels the need for a Fatherland, and it is natural to look for one<br>somewhere abroad. Having found it, he can wallow unrestrainedly in<br>exactly those emotions from which he believes that he has emancipated<br>himself. God, the King, the Empire, the Union Jack--all the overthrown<br>idols can reappear under different names, and because they are not<br>recognised for what they are they can be worshipped with a good<br>conscience. Transferred nationalism, like the use of scapegoats, is a way<br>of attaining salvation without altering one's conduct.<br><br>INDIFFERENCE TO REALITY. All nationalists have the power of not seeing<br>resemblances between similar sets of facts. A British Tory will defend<br>self-determination in Europe and oppose it in India with no feeling of<br>inconsistency. Actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own<br>merits, but according to who does them, and there is almost no kind of<br>outrage--torture, the use of hostages, forced labour, mass deportations,<br>imprisonment without trial, forgery, assassination, the bombing of<br>civilians--which does not change its moral colour when it is committed<br>by 'our' side. The Liberal NEWS CHRONICLE published, as an example of<br>shocking barbarity, photographs of Russians hanged by the Germans, and<br>then a year or two later published with warm approval almost exactly<br>similar photographs of Germans hanged by the Russians.[Note, below] It is<br>the same with historical events. History is thought of largely in nationalist<br>terms, and such things as the Inquisition, the tortures of the Star<br>Chamber, the exploits of the English buccaneers (Sir Francis Drake, for<br>instance, who was given to sinking Spanish prisoners alive), the Reign of<br>Terror, the heroes of the Mutiny blowing hundreds of Indians from the<br>guns, or Cromwell's soldiers slashing Irishwomen's faces with razors,<br>become morally neutral or even meritorious when it is felt that they were<br>done in the 'right' cause. If one looks back over the past quarter of a<br>century, one finds that there was hardly a single year when atrocity<br>stories were not being reported from some part of the world; and yet in<br>not one single case were these atrocities--in Spain, Russia, China,<br>Hungary, Mexico, Amritsar, Smyrna--believed in and disapproved of by the<br>English intelligentsia as a whole. Whether such deeds were reprehensible,<br>or even whether they happened, was always decided according to political<br>predilection.<br><br><br>[Note: The NEWS CHRONICLE advised its readers to visit the news film at<br>which the entire execution could be witnessed, with close-ups. The STAR<br>published with seeming approval photographs of nearly naked female<br>collaborationists being baited by the Paris mob. These photographs had a<br>marked resemblance to the Nazi photographs of Jews being baited by the<br>Berlin mob.(Author's footnote)]<br><br><br>The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by<br>his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about<br>them. For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to<br>learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald. And those who are<br>loudest in denouncing the German concentration camps are often quite<br>unaware, or only very dimly aware, that there are also concentration<br>camps in Russia. Huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving<br>the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of<br>the majority of English russophiles. Many English people have heard<br>almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during<br>the present war. Their own antisemitism has caused this vast crime to<br>bounce off their consciousness. In nationalist thought there are facts<br>which are both true and untrue, known and unknown. A known fact may be so<br>unbearable that it is habitually pushed aside and not allowed to enter<br>into logical processes, or on the other hand it may enter into every<br>calculation and yet never be admitted as a fact, even in one's own mind.<br><br>Every nationalist is haunted by the belief that the past can be altered.<br>He spends part of his time in a fantasy world in which things happen as<br>they should--in which, for example, the Spanish Armada was a success or<br>the Russian Revolution was crushed in 1918--and he will transfer<br>fragments of this world to the history books whenever possible. Much of<br>the propagandist writing of our time amounts to plain forgery. Material<br>facts are suppressed, dates altered, quotations removed from their<br>context and doctored so as to change their meaning. Events which it is<br>felt ought not to have happened are left unmentioned and ultimately<br>denied[Note, below]. In 1927 Chiang Kai Shek boiled hundreds of Communists<br>alive, and yet within ten years he had become one of the heroes of the Left.<br>The re-alignment of world politics had brought him into the anti-Fascist<br>camp, and so it was felt that the boiling of the Communists 'didn't<br>count', or perhaps had not happened. The primary aim of propaganda is, of<br>course, to influence contemporary opinion, but those who rewrite history<br>do probably believe with part of their minds that they are actually<br>thrusting facts into the past. When one considers the elaborate forgeries<br>that have been committed in order to show that Trotsky did not play a<br>valuable part in the Russian civil war, it is difficult to feel that the<br>people responsible are merely lying. More probably they feel that their<br>own version was what happened in the sight of God, and that one is<br>justified in rearranging the records accordingly.<br><br><br>[Note: En example is the Russo-German Pact, which is being effaced as<br>quickly as possible from public memory. A Russian correspondent informs<br>me that mention of the Pact is already being omitted from Russian<br>year-books which table recent political events.(Author's note)]<br><br><br>Indifference to objective truth is encouraged by the sealing-off of one<br>part of the world from another, which makes it harder and harder to<br>discover what is actually happening. There can often be a genuine doubt<br>about the most enormous events. For example, it is impossible to<br>calculate within millions, perhaps even tens of millions, the number of<br>deaths caused by the present war. The calamities that are constantly<br>being reported--battles, massacres, famines, revolutions--tend to<br>inspire in the average person a feeling of unreality. One has no way of<br>verifying the facts, one is not even fully certain that they have<br>happened, and one is always presented with totally different<br>interpretations from different sources. What were the rights and wrongs<br>of the Warsaw rising of August 1944? Is it true about the German gas<br>ovens in Poland? Who was really to blame for the Bengal famine? Probably<br>the truth is discoverable, but the facts will be so dishonestly set forth<br>in almost any newspaper that the ordinary reader can be forgiven either<br>for swallowing lies or failing to form an opinion. The general<br>uncertainty as to what is really happening makes it easier to cling to<br>lunatic beliefs. Since nothing is ever quite proved or disproved, the<br>most unmistakable fact can be impudently denied. Moreover, although<br>endlessly brooding on power, victory, defeat, revenge, the nationalist is<br>often somewhat uninterested in what happens in the real world. What he<br>wants is to FEEL that his own unit is getting the better of some other<br>unit, and he can more easily do this by scoring off an adversary than by<br>examining the facts to see whether they support him. All nationalist<br>controversy is at the debating-society level. It is always entirely<br>inconclusive, since each contestant invariably believes himself to have<br>won the victory. Some nationalists are not far from schizophrenia, living<br>quite happily amid dreams of power and conquest which have no connection<br>with the physical world.<br><br>I have examined as best as I can the mental habits which are common to<br>all forms of nationalism. The next thing is to classify those forms, but<br>obviously this cannot be done comprehensively. Nationalism is an enormous<br>subject. The world is tormented by innumerable delusions and hatreds<br>which cut across one another in an extremely complex way, and some of the<br>most sinister of them have not yet impinged on the European<br>consciousness. In this essay I am concerned with nationalism as it occurs<br>among the English intelligentsia. In them, much more than in ordinary<br>English people, it is unmixed with patriotism and therefore can be<br>studied pure. Below are listed the varieties of nationalism now<br>flourishing among English intellectuals, with such comments as seem to be<br>needed. It is convenient to use three headings, Positive, Transferred,<br>and Negative, though some varieties will fit into more than one category:<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POSITIVE NATIONALISM<br><br>(i) NEO-TORYISM. Exemplified by such people as Lord Elton, A.P. Herbert,<br>G.M. Young, Professor Pickthorn, by the literature of the Tory Reform<br>Committee, and by such magazines as the NEW ENGLISH REVIEW and THE<br>NINETEENTH CENTURY AND AFTER. The real motive force of neo-Toryism,<br>giving it its nationalistic character and differentiating it from<br>ordinary Conservatism, is the desire not to recognise that British power<br>and influence have declined. Even those who are realistic enough to see<br>that Britain's military position is not what it was, tend to claim that<br>'English ideas' (usually left undefined) must dominate the world. All<br>neo-Tories are anti-Russian, but sometimes the main emphasis is<br>anti-American. The significant thing is that this school of thought seems<br>to be gaining ground among youngish intellectuals, sometimes<br>ex-Communists, who have passed through the usual process of<br>disillusionment and become disillusioned with that. The anglophobe who<br>suddenly becomes violently pro-British is a fairly common figure. Writers<br>who illustrate this tendency are F. A. Voigt, Malcolm Muggeridge, Evelyn<br>Waugh, Hugh Kingsmill, and a psychologically similar development can be<br>observed in T. S. Eliot, Wyndham Lewis, and various of their followers.<br><br>(ii) CELTIC NATIONALISM. Welsh, Irish and Scottish nationalism have<br>points of difference but are alike in their anti-English orientation.<br>Members of all three movements have opposed the war while continuing to<br>describe themselves as pro-Russian, and the lunatic fringe has even<br>contrived to be simultaneously pro-Russian and pro-Nazi. But Celtic<br>nationalism is not the same thing as anglophobia. Its motive force is a<br>belief in the past and future greatness of the Celtic peoples, and it has<br>a strong tinge of racialism. The Celt is supposed to be spiritually<br>superior to the Saxon--simpler, more creative, less vulgar, less<br>snobbish, etc.--but the usual power hunger is there under the surface.<br>One symptom of it is the delusion that Eire, Scotland or even Wales could<br>preserve its independence unaided and owes nothing to British protection.<br>Among writers, good examples of this school of thought are Hugh McDiarmid<br>and Sean O'Casey. No modern Irish writer, even of the stature of Yeats or<br>Joyce, is completely free from traces of nationalism.<br><br>(iii) ZIONISM. This the unusual characteristics of a nationalist<br>movement, but the American variant of it seems to be more violent and<br>malignant than the British. I classify it under Direct and not<br>Transferred nationalism because it flourishes almost exclusively among<br>the Jews themselves. In England, for several rather incongruous reasons,<br>the intelligentsia are mostly pro-Jew on the Palestine issue, but they do<br>not feel strongly about it. All English people of goodwill are also<br>pro-Jew in the sense of disapproving of Nazi persecution. But any actual<br>nationalistic loyalty, or belief in the innate superiority of Jews, is<br>hardly to be found among Gentiles.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRANSFERRED NATIONALISM<br><br>(i) COMMUNISM.<br><br>(ii) POLITICAL  ATHOLICISM.<br><br>(iii) COLOUR FEELING. The old-style contemptuous attitude towards<br>'natives' has been much weakened in England, and various<br>pseudo-scientific theories emphasising the superiority of the white race<br>have been abandoned.[Note, below] Among the intelligentsia, colour feeling<br>only occurs in the transposed form, that is, as a belief in the innate<br>superiority of the coloured races. This is now increasingly common among<br>English intellectuals, probably resulting more often from masochism and<br>sexual frustration than from contact with the Oriental and Negro<br>nationalist movements. Even among those who do not feel strongly on the<br>colour question, snobbery and imitation have a powerful influence. Almost<br>any English intellectual would be scandalised by the claim that the white<br>races are superior to the coloured, whereas the opposite claim would seem<br>to him unexceptionable even if he disagreed with it. Nationalistic<br>attachment to the coloured races is usually mixed up with the belief that<br>their sex lives are superior, and there is a large underground mythology<br>about the sexual prowess of Negroes.<br><br><br>[Note: A good example is the sunstroke superstition. Until recently it was<br>believed that the white races were much more liable to sunstroke that the<br>coloured, and that a white man could not safely walk about in tropical<br>sunshine without a pith helmet. There was no evidence whatever for this<br>theory, but it served the purpose of accentuating the difference between<br>'natives' and Europeans. During the war the theory was quietly dropped<br>and whole armies manoeuvred in the tropics without pith helmets. So long<br>as the sunstroke superstition survived, English doctors in India appear<br>to have believed in it as firmly as laymen.(Author's footnote)]<br><br><br>(iv) CLASS FEELING. Among upper-class and middle-class intellectuals,<br>only in the transposed form--i.e. as a belief in the superiority of the<br>proletariat. Here again, inside the intelligentsia, the pressure of<br>public opinion is overwhelming. Nationalistic loyalty towards the<br>proletariat, and most vicious theoretical hatred of the bourgeoisie, can<br>and often do co-exist with ordinary snobbishness in everyday life.<br><br>(v) PACIFISM. The majority of pacifists either belong to obscure<br>religious sects or are simply humanitarians who object to the taking of<br>life and prefer not to follow their thoughts beyond that point. But there<br>is a minority of intellectual pacifists whose real though unadmitted<br>motive appears to be hatred of western democracy and admiration of<br>totalitarianism. Pacifist propaganda usually boils down to saying that<br>one side is as bad as the other, but if one looks closely at the writings<br>of younger intellectual pacifists, one finds that they do not by any<br>means express impartial disapproval but are directed almost entirely<br>against Britain and the United States. Moreover they do not as a rule<br>condemn violence as such, but only violence used in defence of western<br>countries. The Russians, unlike the British, are not blamed for defending<br>themselves by warlike means, and indeed all pacifist propaganda of this<br>type avoids mention of Russia or China. It is not claimed, again, that<br>the Indians should abjure violence in their struggle against the British.<br>Pacifist literature abounds with equivocal remarks which, if they mean<br>anything, appear to mean that statesmen of the type of Hitler are<br>preferable to those of the type of Churchill, and that violence is<br>perhaps excusable if it is violent enough. After the fall of France, the<br>French pacifists, faced by a real choice which their English colleagues<br>have not had to make, mostly went over to the Nazis, and in England there<br>appears to have been some small overlap of membership between the Peace<br>Pledge Union and the Blackshirts. Pacifist writers have written in praise<br>of Carlyle, one of the intellectual fathers of Fascism. All in all it is<br>difficult not to feel that pacifism, as it appears among a section of the<br>intelligentsia, is secretly inspired by an admiration for power and<br>successful cruelty. The mistake was made of pinning this emotion to<br>Hitler, but it could easily be retransfered.<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEGATIVE NATIONALISM<br><br>(i) ANGLOPHOBIA. Within the intelligentsia, a derisive and mildly hostile<br>attitude towards Britain is more or less compulsory, but it is an unfaked<br>emotion in many cases. During the war it was manifested in the defeatism<br>of the intelligentsia, which persisted long after it had become clear<br>that the Axis powers could not win. Many people were undisguisedly<br>pleased when Singapore fell ore when the British were driven out of<br>Greece, and there was a remarkable unwillingness to believe in good news,<br>e.g. el Alamein, or the number of German planes shot down in the Battle<br>of Britain. English left-wing intellectuals did not, of course, actually<br>want the Germans or Japanese to win the war, but many of them could not<br>help getting a certain kick out of seeing their own country humiliated,<br>and wanted to feel that the final victory would be due to Russia, or<br>perhaps America, and not to Britain. In foreign politics many<br>intellectuals follow the principle that any faction backed by Britain<br>must be in the wrong. As a result, 'enlightened' opinion is quite largely<br>a mirror-image of Conservative policy. Anglophobia is always liable to<br>reversal, hence that fairly common spectacle, the pacifist of one war who<br>is a bellicist in the next.<br><br>(ii) ANTI-SEMITISM. There is little evidence about this at present,<br>because the Nazi persecutions have made it necessary for any thinking<br>person to side with the Jews against their oppressors. Anyone educated<br>enough to have heard the word 'antisemitism' claims as a matter of course<br>to be free of it, and anti-Jewish remarks are carefully eliminated from<br>all classes of literature. Actually antisemitism appears to be<br>widespread, even among intellectuals, and the general conspiracy of<br>silence probably helps exacerbate it. People of Left opinions are not<br>immune to it, and their attitude is sometimes affected by the fact that<br>Trotskyists and Anarchists tend to be Jews. But antisemitism comes more<br>naturally to people of Conservative tendency, who suspect Jews of<br>weakening national morale and diluting the national culture. Neo-Tories<br>and political Catholics are always liable to succumb to antisemitism, at<br>least intermittently.<br><br>(iii) TROTSKYISM. This word is used so loosely as to include Anarchists,<br>democratic Socialists and even Liberals. I use it here to mean a<br>doctrinaire Marxist whose main motive is hostility to the Stalin régime.<br>Trotskyism can be better studied in obscure pamphlets or in papers like<br>the SOCIALIST APPEAL than in the works of Trotsky himself, who was by no<br>means a man of one idea. Although in some places, for instance in the<br>United States, Trotskyism is able to attract a fairly large number of<br>adherents and develop into an organised movement with a petty fuerher of<br>its own, its inspiration is essentially negative. The Trotskyist is<br>AGAINST Stalin just as the Communist is FOR him, and, like the majority<br>of Communists, he wants not so much to alter the external world as to<br>feel that the battle for prestige is going in his own favour. In each<br>case there is the same obsessive fixation on a single subject, the same<br>inability to form a genuinely rational opinion based on probabilities.<br>The fact that Trotskyists are everywhere a persecuted minority, and that<br>the accusation usually made against them, i.e. of collaborating with the<br>Fascists, is obviously false, creates an impression that Trotskyism is<br>intellectually and morally superior to Communism; but it is doubtful<br>whether there is much difference. The most typical Trotskyists, in any<br>case, are ex-Communists, and no one arrives at Trotskyism except via one<br>of the left-wing movements. No Communist, unless tethered to his party by<br>years of habit, is secure against a sudden lapse into Trotskyism. The<br>opposite process does not seem to happen equally often, though there is<br>no clear reason why it should not.<br><br>In the classification I have attempted above, it will seem that I have<br>often exaggerated, oversimplified, made unwarranted assumptions and have<br>left out of account the existence of ordinarily decent motives. This was<br>inevitable, because in this essay I am trying to isolate and identify<br>tendencies which exist in all our minds and pervert our thinking, without<br>necessarily occurring in a pure state or operating continuously. It is<br>important at this point to correct the over-simplified picture which I<br>have been obliged to make. To begin with, one has no right to assume that<br>EVERYONE, or even every intellectual, is infected by nationalism.<br>Secondly, nationalism can be intermittent and limited. An intelligent man<br>may half-succumb to a belief which he knows to be absurd, and he may keep<br>it out of his mind for long periods, only reverting to it in moments of<br>anger or sentimentality, or when he is certain that no important issues<br>are involved. Thirdly, a nationalistic creed may be adopted in good faith<br>from non-nationalistic motives. Fourthly, several kinds of nationalism,<br>even kinds that cancel out, can co-exist in the same person.<br><br>All the way through I have said, 'the nationalist does this' or 'the<br>nationalist does that', using for purposes of illustration the extreme,<br>barely sane type of nationalist who has no neutral areas in his mind and<br>no interest in anything except the struggle for power. Actually such<br>people are fairly common, but they are not worth the powder and shot. In<br>real life Lord Elton, D. N. Pritt, Lady Houston, Ezra Pound, Lord<br>Vanisttart, Father Coughlin and all the rest of their dreary tribe have<br>to be fought against, but their intellectual deficiencies hardly need<br>pointing out. Monomania is not interesting, and the fact that no<br>nationalist of the more bigoted kind can write a book which still seems<br>worth reading after a lapse of years has a certain deodorising effect.<br>But when one has admitted that nationalism has not triumphed everywhere,<br>that there are still peoples whose judgements are not at the mercy of<br>their desires, the fact does remain that the pressing problems--India,<br>Poland, Palestine, the Spanish civil war, the Moscow trials, the American<br>Negroes, the Russo-German Pact or what have you--cannot be, or at least<br>never are, discussed upon a reasonable level. The Eltons and Pritts and<br>Coughlins, each of them simply an enormous mouth bellowing the same lie<br>over and over again, are obviously extreme cases, but we deceive<br>ourselves if we do not realise that we can all resemble them in unguarded<br>moments. Let a certain note be struck, let this or that corn be trodden<br>on--and it may be corn whose very existence has been unsuspected<br>hitherto--and the most fair-minded and sweet-tempered person may<br>suddenly be transformed into a vicious partisan, anxious only to 'score'<br>over his adversary and indifferent as to how many lies he tells or how<br>many logical errors he commits in doing so. When Lloyd George, who was an<br>opponent of the Boer War, announced in the House of Commons that the<br>British communiques, if one added them together, claimed the killing of<br>more Boers than the whole Boer nation contained, it is recorded that<br>Arthur Balfour rose to his feet and shouted 'Cad!' Very few people are<br>proof against lapses of this type. The Negro snubbed by a white woman,<br>the Englishman who hears England ignorantly criticised by an American,<br>the Catholic apologist reminded of the Spanish Armada, will all react in<br>much the same way. One prod to the nerve of nationalism, and the<br>intellectual decencies can vanish, the past can be altered, and the<br>plainest facts can be denied.<br><br>If one harbours anywhere in one's mind a nationalistic loyalty or hatred,<br>certain facts, although in a sense known to be true, are inadmissible.<br>Here are just a few examples. I list below five types of nationalist, and<br>against each I append a fact which it is impossible for that type of<br>nationalist to accept, even in his secret thoughts:<br><br>BRITISH TORY: Britain will come out of this war with reduced power and<br>prestige.<br><br>COMMUNIST: If she had not been aided by Britain and America, Russia would<br>have been defeated by Germany.<br><br>IRISH NATIONALIST: Eire can only remain independent because of British<br>protection.<br><br>TROTSKYIST: The Stalin régime is accepted by the Russian masses.<br><br>PACIFIST: Those who 'abjure' violence can only do so because others are<br>committing violence on their behalf.<br><br>All of these facts are grossly obvious if one's emotions do not happen to<br>be involved: but to the kind of person named in each case they are also<br>INTOLERABLE, and so they have to be denied, and false theories<br>constructed upon their denial. I come back to the astonishing failure of<br>military prediction in the present war. It is, I think, true to say that<br>the intelligentsia have been more wrong about the progress of the war<br>than the common people, and that they were more swayed by partisan<br>feelings. The average intellectual of the Left believed, for instance,<br>that the war was lost in 1940, that the Germans were bound to overrun<br>Egypt in 1942, that the Japanese would never be driven out of the lands<br>they had conquered, and that the Anglo-American bombing offensive was<br>making no impression on Germany. He could believe these things because<br>his hatred for the British ruling class forbade him to admit that British<br>plans could succeed. There is no limit to the follies that can be<br>swallowed if one is under the influence of feelings of this kind. I have<br>heard it confidently stated, for instance, that the American troops had<br>been brought to Europe not to fight the Germans but to crush an English<br>revolution. One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things<br>like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool. When Hitler invaded<br>Russia, the officials of the MOI issued 'as background' a warning that<br>Russia might be expected to collapse in six weeks. On the other hand the<br>Communists regarded every phase of the war as a Russian victory, even<br>when the Russians were driven back almost to the Caspian Sea and had lost<br>several million prisoners. There is no need to multiply instances. The<br>point is that as soon as fear, hatred, jealousy and power worship are<br>involved, the sense of reality becomes unhinged. And, as I have pointed<br>out already, the sense of right and wrong becomes unhinged also. There is<br>no crime, absolutely none, that cannot be condoned when 'our' side<br>commits it. Even if one does not deny that the crime has happened, even<br>if one knows that it is exactly the same crime as one has condemned in<br>some other case, even if one admits in an intellectual sense that it is<br>unjustified--still one cannot FEEL that it is wrong. Loyalty is<br>involved, and so pity ceases to function.<br><br>The reason for the rise and spread of nationalism is far too big a<br>question to be raised here. It is enough to say that, in the forms in<br>which it appears among English intellectuals, it is a distorted<br>reflection of the frightful battles actually happening in the external<br>world, and that its worst follies have been made possible by the<br>breakdown of patriotism and religious belief. If one follows up this<br>train of thought, one is in danger of being led into a species of<br>Conservatism, or into political quietism. It can be plausibly argued, for<br>instance--it is even possibly true--that patriotism is an inoculation<br>against nationalism, that monarchy is a guard against dictatorship, and<br>that organised religion is a guard against superstition. Or again, it can<br>be argued that NO unbiased outlook is possible, that ALL creeds and<br>causes involve the same lies, follies, and barbarities; and this is often<br>advanced as a reason for keeping out of politics altogether. I do not<br>accept this argument, if only because in the modern world no one<br>describable as an intellectual CAN keep out of politics in the sense of<br>not caring about them. I think one must engage in politics--using the<br>word in a wide sense--and that one must have preferences: that is, one<br>must recognise that some causes are objectively better than others, even<br>if they are advanced by equally bad means. As for the nationalistic loves<br>and hatreds that I have spoken of, they are part of the make-up of most<br>of us, whether we like it or not. Whether it is possible to get rid of<br>them I do not know, but I do believe that it is possible to struggle<br>against them, and that this is essentially a MORAL effort. It is a<br>question first of all of discovering what one really is, what one's own<br>feelings really are, and then of making allowance for the inevitable<br>bias. If you hate and fear Russia, if you are jealous of the wealth and<br>power of America, if you despise Jews, if you have a sentiment of<br>inferiority towards the British ruling class, you cannot get rid of those<br>feelings simply by taking thought. But you can at least recognise that<br>you have them, and prevent them from contaminating your mental processes.<br>The emotional urges which are inescapable, and are perhaps even necessary<br>to political action, should be able to exist side by side with an<br>acceptance of reality. But this, I repeat, needs a MORAL effort, and<br>contemporary English literature, so far as it is alive at all to the<br>major issues of our time, shows how few of us are prepared to make it.<br><br></font></p>
