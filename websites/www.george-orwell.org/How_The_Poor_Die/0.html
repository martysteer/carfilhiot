<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">In the year 1929 I spent several weeks in the Hôpital X, in the fifteenth<br>ARRONDISSEMENT of Paris. The clerks put me through the usual third-degree<br>at the reception desk, and indeed I was kept answering questions for some<br>twenty minutes before they would let me in. If you have ever had to fill<br>up forms in a Latin country you will know the kind of questions I mean.<br>For some days past I had been unequal to translating Reaumur into<br>Fahrenheit, but I know that my temperature was round about 103, and by<br>the end of the interview I had some difficulty in standing on my feet. At<br>my back a resigned little knot of patients, carrying bundles done up in<br>coloured handkerchiefs, waited their turn to be questioned.<br><br>After the questioning came the bath--a compulsory routine for all<br>newcomers, apparently, just as in prison or the workhouse. My clothes<br>were taken away from me, and after I had sat shivering for some minutes<br>in five inches of warm water I was given a linen nightshirt and a short<br>blue flannel dressing-gown--no slippers, they had none big enough for<br>me, they said--and led out into the open air. This was a night in<br>February and I was suffering from pneumonia. The ward we were going to<br>was 200 yards away and it seemed that to get to it you had to cross the<br>hospital grounds. Someone stumbled in front of me with a lantern. The<br>gravel path was frosty underfoot, and the wind whipped the nightshirt<br>round my bare calves. When we got into the ward I was aware of a strange<br>feeling of familiarity whose origin I did not succeed in pinning down<br>till later in the night. It was a long, rather low, ill-lit room, full of<br>murmuring voices and with three rows of beds surprisingly close together.<br>There was a foul smell, faecal and yet sweetish. As I lay down I saw on a<br>bed nearly opposite me a small, round-shouldered, sandy-haired man<br>sitting half naked while a doctor and a student performed some strange<br>operation on him. First the doctor produced from his black bag a dozen<br>small glasses like wine glasses, then the student burned a match inside<br>each glass to exhaust the air, then the glass was popped on to the man's<br>back or chest and the vacuum drew up a huge yellow blister. Only after<br>some moments did I realize what they were doing to him. It was something<br>called cupping, a treatment which you can read about in old medical<br>text-books but which till then I had vaguely thought of as one of those<br>things they do to horses.<br><br>The cold air outside had probably lowered my temperature, and I watched<br>this barbarous remedy with detachment and even a certain amount of<br>amusement. The next moment, however, the doctor and the student came<br>across to my bed, hoisted me upright and without a word began applying<br>the same set of glasses, which had not been sterilized in any way. A few<br>feeble protests that I uttered got no more response than if I had been an<br>animal. I was very much impressed by the impersonal way in which the two<br>men started on me. I had never been in the public ward of a hospital<br>before, and it was my first experience of doctors who handle you without<br>speaking to you or, in a human sense, taking any notice of you. They only<br>put on six glasses in my case, but after doing so they scarified the<br>blisters and applied the glasses again. Each glass now drew about a<br>dessert-spoonful of dark-coloured blood. As I lay down again, humiliated,<br>disgusted and frightened by the thing that had been done to me, I<br>reflected that now at least they would leave me alone. But no, not a bit<br>of it. There was another treatment. coming, the mustard poultice,<br>seemingly a matter of routine like the hot bath. Two slatternly nurses<br>had already got the poultice ready, and they lashed it round my chest as<br>tight as a strait-jacket while some men who were wandering about the ward<br>in shirt and trousers began to collect round my bed with half-sympathetic<br>grins. I learned later that watching a patient have a mustard poultice<br>was a favourite pastime in the ward. These things are normally applied<br>for a quarter of an hour and certainly they are funny enough if you don't<br>happen to be the person inside. For the first five minutes the pain is<br>severe, but you believe you can bear it. During the second five minutes<br>this belief evaporates, but the poultice is buckled at the back and you<br>can't get it off. This is the period the onlookers enjoy most. During the<br>last five minutes, I noted, a sort of numbness supervenes. After the<br>poultice had been removed a waterproof pillow packed with ice was thrust<br>beneath my head and I was left alone. I did not sleep, and to the best of<br>my knowledge this was the only night of my life--I mean the only night<br>spent in bed--in which I have not slept at all, not even a minute.<br><br>During my first hour in the Hôpital X I had had a whole series of<br>different and contradictory treatments, but this was misleading, for in<br>general you got very little treatment at all, either good or bad, unless<br>you were ill in some interesting and instructive way. At five in the<br>morning the nurses came round, woke the patients and took their<br>temperatures, but did not wash them. If you were well enough you washed<br>yourself, otherwise you depended on the kindness of some walking patient.<br>It was generally patients, too, who carried the bedbottles and die grim<br>bedpan, nicknamed LA CASSEROLE. At eight breakfast arrived, called<br>army-fashion LA SOUPE. It was soup, too, a thin vegetable soup with slimy<br>hunks of bread floating about in it. Later in the day the tall, solemn,<br>black-bearded doctor made his rounds, with an INTERNE and a troop of<br>students following at his heels, but there were about sixty of us in the<br>ward and it was evident that he had other wards to attend to as well.<br>There were many beds past which he walked day after day, sometimes<br>followed by imploring cries. On the other hand if you had some disease<br>with which the students wanted to familiarize themselves you got plenty<br>of attention of a kind. I myself, with an exceptionally fine specimen of<br>a bronchial rattle, sometimes had as many as a dozen students queuing up<br>to listen to my chest. It was a very queer feeling--queer, I mean,<br>because of their intense interest in learning their job, together with a<br>seeming lack of any perception that the patients were human beings. It is<br>strange to relate, but sometimes as some young student stepped forward to<br>take his turn at manipulating you he would be actually tremulous with<br>excitement, like a boy who has at last got his hands on some expensive<br>piece of machinery. And then ear after ear--ears of young men, of girls,<br>of negroes--pressed against your back, relays of fingers solemnly but<br>clumsily tapping, and not from any one of them did you get a word of<br>conversation or a look direct in your face. As a non-paying patient, in<br>the uniform nightshirt, you were primarily A SPECIMEN, a thing I did not<br>resent but could never quite get used to.<br><br>After some days I grew well enough to sit up and study the surrounding<br>patients. The stuffy room, with its narrow beds so close together that<br>you could easily touch your neighbour's hand, had every sort of disease<br>in it except, I suppose, acutely infectious cases. My right-hand<br>neighbour was a little red-haired cobbler with one leg shorter than the<br>other, who used to announce the death of any other patient (this happened<br>a number of times, and my neighbour was always the first to hear of it)<br>by whistling to me, exclaiming "NUMÉRO 43!" (or whatever it was) and<br>flinging his arms above his head. This man had not much wrong with him,<br>but in most of the other beds within my angle of vision some squalid<br>tragedy or some plain horror was being enacted. In the bed that was foot<br>to foot with mine there lay, until he died (I didn't see him die--they<br>moved him to another bed), a little weazened man who was suffering from I<br>do not know what disease, but something that made his whole body so<br>intensely sensitive that any movement from side to side, sometimes even<br>the weight of the bedclothes, would make him shout out with pain. His<br>worst suffering was when he urinated, which he did with the greatest<br>difficulty. A nurse would bring him the bedbottle and then for a long<br>time stand beside his bed, whistling, as grooms are said to do with<br>horses, until at last with an agonized shriek of "Je fissel" he would get<br>started. In the bed next to him the sandy-haired man whom I had seen<br>being cupped used to cough up blood-streaked mucus at all hours. My<br>left-hand neighbour was a tall, flaccid-looking young man who used<br>periodically to have a tube inserted into his back and astonishing<br>quantities of frothy liquid drawn off from some part of his body. In the<br>bed beyond that a veteran of the war of 1870 was dying, a handsome old<br>man with a white imperial, round whose bed, at all hours when visiting<br>was allowed, four elderly female relatives dressed all in black sat<br>exactly like crows, obviously scheming for some pitiful legacy. In the<br>bed opposite me in the farther row was an old bald-headed man with<br>drooping moustaches and greatly swollen face and body, who was suffering<br>from some disease that made him urinate almost incessantly. A huge glass<br>receptacle stood always beside his bed. One day his wife and daughter<br>came to visit him. At sight of them the old man's bloated face lit up<br>with a smile of surprising sweetness, and as his daughter, a pretty girl<br>of about twenty, approached the bed I saw that his hand was slowly<br>working its way from under the bedclothes. I seemed to see in advance the<br>gesture that was coming--the girl kneeling beside the bed, the old man's<br>hand laid on her head in his dying blessing. But no, he merely handed her<br>the bedbottle, which she promptly took from him and emptied into the<br>receptacle.<br><br>About a dozen beds away from me was Numéro 57--I think that was his<br>number--a cirrhosis-of-the-liver case. Everyone in the ward knew him by<br>sight because he was sometimes the subject of a medical lecture. On two<br>afternoons a week the tall, grave doctor would lecture in the ward to a<br>party of students, and on more than one occasion old NUMÉRO 57 was<br>wheeled in on a sort of trolley into the middle of the ward, where the<br>doctor would roll back his nightshirt, dilate with his fingers a huge<br>flabby protruber-ance on the man's belly--the diseased liver, I suppose<br>--and explain solemnly that this was a disease attributable to<br>alcoholism, commoner in the wine-drinking countries. As usual he neither<br>spoke to his patient nor gave him a smile, a nod or any kind of<br>recognition. While he talked, very grave and upright, he would hold the<br>wasted body beneath his two hands, sometimes giving it a gentle roll to<br>and fro, in just the attitude of a woman handling a rolling-pin. Not that<br>NUMÉRO 57 minded this kind of thing. Obviously he was an old hospital<br>inmate, a regular exhibit at lectures, his liver long since marked down<br>for a bottle in some pathological museum. Utterly uninterested in what<br>was said about him, he would lie with his colourless eyes gazing at<br>nothing, while the doctor showed him off like a piece of antique china.<br>He was a man of about sixty, astonishingly shrunken. His face, pale as<br>vellum, had shrunken away till it seemed no bigger than a doll's.<br><br>One morning my cobbler neighbour woke me up plucking at my pillow before<br>the nurses arrived. "NUMÉRO 57!"--he flung his arms above his head.<br>There was a light in the ward, enough to see by. I could see old NUMÉRO<br>57 lying crumpled up on his side, his face sticking out over the side of<br>the bed, and towards me. He had died some rime during the night, nobody<br>knew when. When the nurses came they received the news of his death<br>indifferendy and went about their work. After a long dme, an hour or<br>more, two other nurses marched in abreast like soldiers, with a great<br>clumping of sabots, and knotted the corpse up in the sheets, but it was<br>not removed till some dme later. Meanwhile, in the better light, I had<br>had time for a good look at NUMÉRO 57. Indeed I lay on my side to look at<br>him. Curiously enough he was the first dead European I had seen. I had<br>seen dead men before, but always Asiatics and usually people who had died<br>violent deaths. NUMÉRO 57's eyes were still open, his mouth also open,<br>his small face contorted into an expression of agony. What most impressed<br>me, however, was the whiteness of his face. It had been pale before, but<br>now it was little darker than die sheets. As I gazed at the tiny,<br>screwed-up face it struck me that dlis disgusting piece of refuse,<br>waiting to be carted away and dumped on a slab in the dissecting room,<br>was an example of "natural" death, one of the things you pray for in the<br>Litany. There you are, then, I thought, that's what is waiting for you,<br>twenty, thirty, forty years hence: that is how the lucky ones die, the<br>ones who live to be old. One wants to live, of course, indeed one only<br>stays alive by virtue of the fear of death, but I think now, as I thought<br>then, that it's better to die violently and not too old. People talk<br>about the horrors of war, but what weapon has man invented that even<br>approaches in cruelty some of the commoner diseases? "Natural" death,<br>almost by definition, means something slow, smelly and painful. Even at<br>that, it makes a difference if you can achieve it in your own home and<br>not in a public institution. This poor old wretch who had just flickered<br>out like a candle-end was not even important enough to have anyone<br>watching by his deathbed. He was merely a number, then a "subject" for<br>the students' scalpels. And the sordid publicity of dying in such a<br>place! In the Hôpital X the beds were very close together and there were<br>no screens. Fancy, for instance, dying like the little man whose bed was<br>for a while foot to foot with mine, the one who cried out when the<br>bedclothes touched him! I dare say "JE PISSE!" were his last recorded<br>words. Perhaps the dying don't bother about such things--that at least<br>would be the standard answer: nevertheless dying people are often more or<br>less normal in their minds till within a day or so of the end.<br><br>In the public wards of a hospital you see horrors that you don't seem to<br>meet with among people who manage to die in their own homes, as though<br>certain diseases only attacked people at the lower income levels. But it<br>is a fact that you would not in any English hospitals see some of the<br>things I saw in the Hôpital X. This business of people just dying like<br>animals, for instance, with nobody standing by, nobody interested, the<br>death not even noticed till the morning--this happened more than once.<br>You certainly would not see that in England, and still less would you see<br>a corpse left exposed to the view of the other patients. I remember that<br>once in a cottage hospital in England a man died while we were at tea,<br>and though there were only six of us in the ward the nurses managed<br>things so adroitly that the man was dead and his body removed without our<br>even hearing about it till tea was over. A thing we perhaps underrate in<br>England is the advantage we enjoy in having large numbers of well-trained<br>and rigidly-disciplined nurses. No doubt English nurses are dumb enough,<br>they may tell fortunes with tea-leaves, wear Union Jack badges and keep<br>photographs of the Queen on their mantelpieces, but at least they don't<br>let you lie unwashed and constipated on an unmade bed, out of sheer<br>laziness. The nurses at the Hôpital X still had a tinge of Mrs Gamp about<br>them, and later, in the military hospitals of Republican Spain, I was to<br>see nurses almost too ignorant to take a temperature. You wouldn't,<br>either, see in England such dirt as existed in the Hôpital X. Later on,<br>when I was well enough to wash myself in the bathroom, I found that there<br>was kept there a huge packing case into which the scraps of food and<br>dirty dressings from the ward were flung, and the wainscodngs were<br>infested by crickets. When I had got back my clothes and grown strong on<br>my legs I fled from the Hôpital X, before my time was up and without<br>waiting for a medical discharge. It was not the only hospital I have fled<br>from, but its gloom and bareness, its sickly smell and, above all,<br>something in its mental atmosphere stand out in my memory as exceptional.<br>I had been taken there because it was the hospital belonging to my<br>ARRONDISSEMENT, and I did not learn till after I was in it that it bore a<br>bad reputation. A year or two later the celebrated swindler, Madame<br>Han-aud, who was ill while on remand, was taken to the Hôpital X, and<br>after a few days of it she managed to elude her guards, took a taxi and<br>drove back to the prison, explaining that she was more comfortable there.<br>I have no doubt that the Hôpital X was quite untypical of French<br>hospitals even at that date. But the patients, nearly all of them working<br>men, were surprisingly resigned. Some of them seemed to find the<br>conditions almost comfortable, for at least two were destitute<br>malingerers who found this a good way of getting through the winter. The<br>nurses connived because the malingerers made themselves useful by doing<br>odd jobs. But the attitude of the majority was: of course this is a lousy<br>place, but what else do you expect? It did not seem strange to them that<br>you should be woken at five and then wait three hours before starting the<br>day on watery soup, or that people should die with no one at their<br>bedside, or even that your chance of getting medical attention should<br>depend on catching the doctor's eye as he went past. According to their<br>traditions that was what hospitals were like. If you are seriously ill<br>and if you are too poor to be treated in your own home, then you must go<br>into hospital, and once there you must put up with harshness and<br>discomfort, just as you would in the army. But on top of this I was<br>interested to find a lingering belief in the old stories that have now<br>almost faded from memory in England--stories, for instance, about<br>doctors cutting you open out of sheer curiosity or thinking it funny to<br>start operating before you were properly "under". There were dark tales<br>about a little operating-room said to be situated just beyond the<br>bathroom. Dreadful screams were said to issue from this room. I saw<br>nothing to confirm these stories and no doubt they were all nonsense,<br>though I did see two students kill a sixteen-year-old boy, or nearly kill<br>him (he appeared to be dying when I left the hospital, but he may have<br>recovered later) by a mischievous experiment which they probably could<br>not have tried on a paying patient. Well within living memory it used to<br>be believed in London that in some of the big hospitals patients were<br>killed off to get dissection subjects. I didn't hear this tale repeated<br>at the Hôpital X, but I should think some of the men there would have<br>found it credible. For it was a hospital in which not the methods,<br>perhaps, but something of the atmosphere of the nineteenth century had<br>managed to survive, and therein lay its peculiar interest.<br><br>During the past fifty years or so there has been a great change in the<br>relationship between doctor and patient. If you look at almost any<br>literature before the later part of the nineteenth century, you find that<br>a hospital is popularly regarded as much the same thing as a prison, and<br>an old-fashioned, dungeon-like prison at that. A hospital is a place of<br>filth, torture and death, a sort of antechamber to the tomb. No one who<br>was not more or less destitute would have thought of going into such a<br>place for treatment. And especially in the early part of the last<br>century, when medical science had grown bolder than before without being<br>any more successful, the whole business of doctoring was looked on with<br>horror and dread by ordinary people. Surgery, in particular, was believed<br>to be no more than a peculiarly gruesome form of sadism, and dissection,<br>possible only with the aid of bodysnatchers, was even confused with<br>necromancy. From the nineteenth century you could collect a large<br>horror-literature connected with doctors and hospitals. Think of poor old<br>George III, in his dotage, shrieking for mercy as he sees his surgeons<br>approaching to "bleed him till he faints"! Think of the conversations of<br>Bob Sawyer and Benjamin Alien, which no doubt are hardly parodies, or the<br>field hospitals in LA DÉBÂCLE and WAR AND PEACE, or that shocking<br>description of an amputation in Melville's WHITEJACKET! Even the names<br>given to doctors in nineteenth-century English fiction, Slasher, Carver,<br>Sawyer, Fillgrave and so on, and the generic nickname "sawbones", are<br>about as grim as they are comic. The anti-surgery tradition is perhaps<br>best expressed in Tennyson's poem, The Children's Hospital, which is<br>essentially a pre-chloroform document though it seems to have been<br>written as late as 1880. Moreover, the outlook which Tennyson records in<br>this poem had a lot to be said for it. When you consider what an<br>operation without anaesthetics must have been like, what it notoriously<br>WAS like, it is difficult not to suspect the motives of people who would<br>undertake such things. For these bloody horrors which the students so<br>eagerly looked forward to ("A magnificent sight if Slasher does it!")<br>were admittedly more or less useless: the patient who did not die of<br>shock usually died of gangrene, a result which was taken for granted.<br>Even now doctors can be found whose motives are questionable. Anyone who<br>has had much illness, or who has listened to medical students talking,<br>will know what I mean. But anaesthetics were a turning point, and<br>disinfectants were another. Nowhere in the world, probably would you now<br>see the kind of scene described by Axel Munthe in THE STORY OF SAN<br>MICHELE, when the sinister surgeon in top hat and frock coat, his<br>starched shirtfront spattered with blood and pus, carves up patient after<br>patient with the same knife and flings the severed limbs into a pile<br>beside the table. Moreover, the national health insurance has partly done<br>away with the idea that a working-class patient is a pauper who deserves<br>little consideration. Well into this century it was usual for "free"<br>patients at the big hospitals to have their teeth extracted with no<br>anaesthetic. They didn't pay, so why should they have an anaesthetic--<br>that was the attitude. That too has changed.<br><br>And yet every institution will always bear upon it some lingering memory<br>of its past. A barrack-room is still haunted by the ghost of Kipling, and<br>it is difficult to enter a workhouse without being reminded of OLIVER<br>TWIST. Hospitals began as a kind of casual ward for lepers and the like<br>to die in, and they continued as places where medical students learned<br>their art on the bodies of the poor. You can still catch a faint<br>suggestion of their history in their characteristically gloomy<br>architecture. I would be far from complaining about the treatment I have<br>received in any English hospital, but I do know that it is a sound<br>instinct that warns people to keep out of hospitals if possible, and<br>especially out of the public wards. Whatever the legal position may be,<br>it is unquestionable that you have far less control over your own<br>treatment, far less certainty that frivolous experiments will not be<br>tried on you, when it is a case of "accept the discipline or get out".<br>And it is a great thing to die in your own bed, though it is better still<br>to die in your boots. However great the kindness and the efficiency, in<br>every hospital death there will be some cruel, squalid detail, something<br>perhaps too small to be told but leaving terribly painful memories<br>behind, arising out of the haste, the crowding, the impersonality of a<br>place where every day people are dying among strangers.<br><br>The dread of hospitals probably still survives among the very poor, and<br>in all of us it has only recently disappeared. It is a dark patch not far<br>beneath the surface of our minds. I have said earlier that when I entered<br>the ward at the Hôpital X I was conscious of a strange feeling of<br>familiarity. What the scene reminded me of, of course, was the reeking,<br>pain-filled hospitals of the nineteenth century, which I had never seen<br>but of which I had a traditional knowledge. And something, perhaps the<br>black-clad doctor with his frowsy black bag, or perhaps only the sickly<br>smell, played the queer trick of unearthing from my memory that poem of<br>Tennyson's, The Children's Hospital, which I had not thought of for<br>twenty years. It happened that as a child I had had it read aloud to me<br>by a sick-nurse whose own working life might have stretched back to the<br>time when Tennyson wrote the poem. The horrors and sufferings of the<br>old-style hospitals were a vivid memory to her. We had shuddered over the<br>poem together, and then seemingly I had forgotten it. Even its name would<br>probably have recalled nothing to me. But the first glimpse of the<br>ill-lit murmurous room, with the beds so close together, suddenly roused<br>the train of thought to which it belonged, and in the night that followed<br>I found myself remembering the whole story and atmosphere of the poem,<br>with many of its lines complete.<br><br></font></p>
