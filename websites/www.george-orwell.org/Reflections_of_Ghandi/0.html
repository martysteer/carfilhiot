<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent, but<br>the tests that have to be applied to them are not, of course, the same in<br>all cases. In Gandhi's case the questions on feels inclined to ask are:<br>to what extent was Gandhi moved by vanity--by the consciousness of<br>himself as a humble, naked old man, sitting on a praying mat and shaking<br>empires by sheer spiritual power--and to what extent did he compromise<br>his own principles by entering politics, which of their nature are<br>inseparable from coercion and fraud? To give a definite answer one would<br>have to study Gandhi's acts and writings in immense detail, for his whole<br>life was a sort of pilgrimage in which every act was significant. But<br>this partial autobiography, which ends in the nineteen-twenties, is<br>strong evidence in his favor, all the more because it covers what he<br>would have called the unregenerate part of his life and reminds one that<br>inside the saint, or near-saint, there was a very shrewd, able person who<br>could, if he had chosen, have been a brilliant success as a lawyer, an<br>administrator or perhaps even a businessman.<br><br>At about the time when the autobiography first appeared I remember<br>reading its opening chapters in the ill-printed pages of some Indian<br>newspaper. They made a good impression on me, which Gandhi himself at<br>that time did not. The things that one associated with him--home-spun<br>cloth, "soul forces" and vegetarianism--were unappealing, and his<br>medievalist program was obviously not viable in a backward, starving,<br>over-populated country. It was also apparent that the British were making<br>use of him, or thought they were making use of him. Strictly speaking, as<br>a Nationalist, he was an enemy, but since in every crisis he would exert<br>himself to prevent violence--which, from the British point of view,<br>meant preventing any effective action whatever--he could be regarded as<br>"our man". In private this was sometimes cynically admitted. The attitude<br>of the Indian millionaires was similar. Gandhi called upon them to<br>repent, and naturally they preferred him to the Socialists and Communists<br>who, given the chance, would actually have taken their money away. How<br>reliable such calculations are in the long run is doubtful; as Gandhi<br>himself says, "in the end deceivers deceive only themselves"; but at any<br>rate the gentleness with which he was nearly always handled was due<br>partly to the feeling that he was useful. The British Conservatives only<br>became really angry with him when, as in 1942, he was in effect turning<br>his non-violence against a different conqueror.<br><br>But I could see even then that the British officials who spoke of him<br>with a mixture of amusement and disapproval also genuinely liked and<br>admired him, after a fashion. Nobody ever suggested that he was corrupt,<br>or ambitious in any vulgar way, or that anything he did was actuated by<br>fear or malice. In judging a man like Gandhi one seems instinctively to<br>apply high standards, so that some of his virtues have passed almost<br>unnoticed. For instance, it is clear even from the autobiography that his<br>natural physical courage was quite outstanding: the manner of his death<br>was a later illustration of this, for a public man who attached any value<br>to his own skin would have been more adequately guarded. Again, he seems<br>to have been quite free from that maniacal suspiciousness which, as E.M.<br>Forster rightly says in A PASSAGE TO INDIA, is the besetting Indian vice,<br>as hypocrisy is the British vice. Although no doubt he was shrewd enough<br>in detecting dishonesty, he seems wherever possible to have believed that<br>other people were acting in good faith and had a better nature through<br>which they could be approached. And though he came of a poor middle-class<br>family, started life rather unfavorably, and was probably of unimpressive<br>physical appearance, he was not afflicted by envy or by the feeling of<br>inferiority. Color feeling when he first met it in its worst form in<br>South Africa, seems rather to have astonished him. Even when he was<br>fighting what was in effect a color war, he did not think of people in<br>terms of race or status. The governor of a province, a cotton<br>millionaire, a half-starved Dravidian coolie, a British private soldier<br>were all equally human beings, to be approached in much the same way. It<br>is noticeable that even in the worst possible circumstances, as in South<br>Africa when he was making himself unpopular as the champion of the Indian<br>community, he did not lack European friends.<br><br>Written in short lengths for newspaper serialization, the autobiography<br>is not a literary masterpiece, but it is the more impressive because of<br>the commonplaceness of much of its material. It is well to be reminded<br>that Gandhi started out with the normal ambitions of a young Indian<br>student and only adopted his extremist opinions by degrees and, in some<br>cases, rather unwillingly. There was a time, it is interesting to learn,<br>when he wore a top hat, took dancing lessons, studied French and Latin,<br>went up the Eiffel Tower and even tried to learn the violin--all this<br>was the idea of assimilating European civilization as throughly as<br>possible. He was not one of those saints who are marked out by their<br>phenomenal piety from childhood onwards, nor one of the other kind who<br>forsake the world after sensational debaucheries. He makes full<br>confession of the misdeeds of his youth, but in fact there is not much to<br>confess. As a frontispiece to the book there is a photograph of Gandhi's<br>possessions at the time of his death. The whole outfit could be purchased<br>for about 5 pounds, and Gandhi's sins, at least his fleshly sins,<br>would make the same sort of appearance if placed all in one heap. A few<br>cigarettes, a few mouthfuls of meat, a few annas pilfered in childhood<br>from the maidservant, two visits to a brothel (on each occasion he got<br>away without "doing anything"), one narrowly escaped lapse with his<br>landlady in Plymouth, one outburst of temper--that is about the whole<br>collection. Almost from childhood onwards he had a deep earnestness, an<br>attitude ethical rather than religious, but, until he was about thirty,<br>no very definite sense of direction. His first entry into anything<br>describable as public life was made by way of vegetarianism. Underneath<br>his less ordinary qualities one feels all the time the solid middle-class<br>businessmen who were his ancestors. One feels that even after he had<br>abandoned personal ambition he must have been a resourceful, energetic<br>lawyer and a hard-headed political organizer, careful in keeping down<br>expenses, an adroit handler of committees and an indefatigable chaser of<br>subscriptions. His character was an extraordinarily mixed one, but there<br>was almost nothing in it that you can put your finger on and call bad,<br>and I believe that even Gandhi's worst enemies would admit that he was an<br>interesting and unusual man who enriched the world simply by being alive.<br>Whether he was also a lovable man, and whether his teachings can have<br>much for those who do not accept the religious beliefs on which they are<br>founded, I have never felt fully certain.<br><br>Of late years it has been the fashion to talk about Gandhi as though he<br>were not only sympathetic to the Western Left-wing movement, but were<br>integrally part of it. Anarchists and pacifists, in particular, have<br>claimed him for their own, noticing only that he was opposed to<br>centralism and State violence and ignoring the other-worldly,<br>anti-humanist tendency of his doctrines. But one should, I think, realize<br>that Gandhi's teachings cannot be squared with the belief that Man is the<br>measure of all things and that our job is to make life worth living on<br>this earth, which is the only earth we have. They make sense only on the<br>assumption that God exists and that the world of solid objects is an<br>illusion to be escaped from. It is worth considering the disciplines<br>which Gandhi imposed on himself and which--though he might not insist on<br>every one of his followers observing every detail--he considered<br>indispensable if one wanted to serve either God or humanity. First of<br>all, no meat-eating, and if possible no animal food in any form. (Gandhi<br>himself, for the sake of his health, had to compromise on milk, but seems<br>to have felt this to be a backsliding.) No alcohol or tobacco, and no<br>spices or condiments even of a vegetable kind, since food should be taken<br>not for its own sake but solely in order to preserve one's strength.<br>Secondly, if possible, no sexual intercourse. If sexual intercourse must<br>happen, then it should be for the sole purpose of begetting children and<br>presumably at long intervals. Gandhi himself, in his middle thirties,<br>took the vow of BRAMAHCHARYA, which means not only complete chastity but<br>the elimination of sexual desire. This condition, it seems, is difficult<br>to attain without a special diet and frequent fasting. One of the dangers<br>of milk-drinking is that it is apt to arouse sexual desire. And finally –<br>this is the cardinal point--for the seeker after goodness there must be<br>no close friendships and no exclusive loves whatever.<br><br>Close friendships, Gandhi says, are dangerous, because "friends react on<br>one another" and through loyalty to a friend one can be led into<br>wrong-doing. This is unquestionably true. Moreover, if one is to love<br>God, or to love humanity as a whole, one cannot give one's preference to<br>any individual person. This again is true, and it marks the point at<br>which the humanistic and the religious attitude cease to be reconcilable.<br>To an ordinary human being, love means nothing if it does not mean loving<br>some people more than others. The autobiography leaves it uncertain<br>whether Gandhi behaved in an inconsiderate way to his wife and children,<br>but at any rate it makes clear that on three occasions he was willing to<br>let his wife or a child die rather than administer the animal food<br>prescribed by the doctor. It is true that the threatened death never<br>actually occurred, and also that Gandhi--with, one gathers, a good deal<br>of moral pressure in the opposite direction--always gave the patient the<br>choice of staying alive at the price of committing a sin: still, if the<br>decision had been solely his own, he would have forbidden the animal<br>food, whatever the risks might be. There must, he says, be some limit to<br>what we will do in order to remain alive, and the limit is well on this<br>side of chicken broth. This attitude is perhaps a noble one, but, in the<br>sense which--I think--most people would give to the word, it is<br>inhuman. The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection,<br>that one is sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty,<br>that one does not push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly<br>intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be<br>defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of<br>fastening one's love upon other human individuals. No doubt alcohol,<br>tobacco, and so forth, are things that a saint must avoid, but sainthood<br>is also a thing that human beings must avoid. There is an obvious retort<br>to this, but one should be wary about making it. In this yogi-ridden age,<br>it is too readily assumed that "non-attachment" is not only better than a<br>full acceptance of earthly life, but that the ordinary man only rejects<br>it because it is too difficult: in other words, that the average human<br>being is a failed saint. It is doubtful whether this is true. Many people<br>genuinely do not wish to be saints, and it is probable that some who<br>achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be<br>human beings. If one could follow it to its psychological roots, one<br>would, I believe, find that the main motive for "non-attachment" is a<br>desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which,<br>sexual or non-sexual, is hard work. But it is not necessary here to argue<br>whether the other-worldly or the humanistic ideal is "higher". The point<br>is that they are incompatible. One must choose between God and Man, and<br>all "radicals" and "progressives", from the mildest Liberal to the most<br>extreme Anarchist, have in effect chosen Man.<br><br>However, Gandhi's pacifism can be separated to some extent from his other<br>teachings. Its motive was religious, but he claimed also for it that it<br>was a definitive technique, a method, capable of producing desired<br>political results. Gandhi's attitude was not that of most Western<br>pacifists. SATYAGRAHA, first evolved in South Africa, was a sort of<br>non-violent warfare, a way of defeating the enemy without hurting him and<br>without feeling or arousing hatred. It entailed such things as civil<br>disobedience, strikes, lying down in front of railway trains, enduring<br>police charges without running away and without hitting back, and the<br>like. Gandhi objected to "passive resistance" as a translation of<br>SATYAGRAHA: in Gujarati, it seems, the word means "firmness in the<br>truth". In his early days Gandhi served as a stretcher-bearer on the<br>British side in the Boer War, and he was prepared to do the same again in<br>the war of 1914-18. Even after he had completely abjured violence he was<br>honest enough to see that in war it is usually necessary to take sides.<br>He did not--indeed, since his whole political life centred round a<br>struggle for national independence, he could not--take the sterile and<br>dishonest line of pretending that in every war both sides are exactly the<br>same and it makes no difference who wins. Nor did he, like most Western<br>pacifists, specialize in avoiding awkward questions. In relation to the<br>late war, one question that every pacifist had a clear obligation to<br>answer was: "What about the Jews? Are you prepared to see them<br>exterminated? If not, how do you propose to save them without resorting<br>to war?" I must say that I have never heard, from any Western pacifist,<br>an honest answer to this question, though I have heard plenty of<br>evasions, usually of the "you're another" type. But it so happens that<br>Gandhi was asked a somewhat similar question in 1938 and that his answer<br>is on record in Mr. Louis Fischer's GANDHI AND STALIN. According to Mr.<br>Fischer, Gandhi's view was that the German Jews ought to commit<br>collective suicide, which "would have aroused the world and the people of<br>Germany to Hitler's violence." After the war he justified himself: the<br>Jews had been killed anyway, and might as well have died significantly.<br>One has the impression that this attitude staggered even so warm an<br>admirer as Mr. Fischer, but Gandhi was merely being honest. If you are<br>not prepared to take life, you must often be prepared for lives to be<br>lost in some other way. When, in 1942, he urged non-violent resistance<br>against a Japanese invasion, he was ready to admit that it might cost<br>several million deaths.<br><br>At the same time there is reason to think that Gandhi, who after all was<br>born in 1869, did not understand the nature of totalitarianism and saw<br>everything in terms of his own struggle against the British government.<br>The important point here is not so much that the British treated him<br>forbearingly as that he was always able to command publicity. As can be<br>seen from the phrase quoted above, he believed in "arousing the world",<br>which is only possible if the world gets a chance to hear what you are<br>doing. It is difficult to see how Gandhi's methods could be applied in a<br>country where opponents of the régime disappear in the middle of the<br>night and are never heard of again. Without a free press and the right of<br>assembly, it is impossible not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but<br>to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions<br>known to your adversary. Is there a Gandhi in Russia at this moment? And<br>if there is, what is he accomplishing? The Russian masses could only<br>practise civil disobedience if the same idea happened to occur to all of<br>them simultaneously, and even then, to judge by the history of the<br>Ukraine famine, it would make no difference. But let it be granted that<br>non-violent resistance can be effective against one's own government, or<br>against an occupying power: even so, how does one put it into practise<br>internationally? Gandhi's various conflicting statements on the late war<br>seem to show that he felt the difficulty of this. Applied to foreign<br>politics, pacifism either stops being pacifist or becomes appeasement.<br>Moreover the assumption, which served Gandhi so well in dealing with<br>individuals, that all human beings are more or less approachable and will<br>respond to a generous gesture, needs to be seriously questioned. It is<br>not necessarily true, for example, when you are dealing with lunatics.<br>Then the question becomes: Who is sane? Was Hitler sane? And is it not<br>possible for one whole culture to be insane by the standards of another?<br>And, so far as one can gauge the feelings of whole nations, is there any<br>apparent connection between a generous deed and a friendly response? Is<br>gratitude a factor in international politics?<br><br>These and kindred questions need discussion, and need it urgently, in the<br>few years left to us before somebody presses the button and the rockets<br>begin to fly. It seems doubtful whether civilization can stand another<br>major war, and it is at least thinkable that the way out lies through<br>non-violence. It is Gandhi's virtue that he would have been ready to give<br>honest consideration to the kind of question that I have raised above;<br>and, indeed, he probably did discuss most of these questions somewhere or<br>other in his innumerable newspaper articles. One feels of him that there<br>was much he did not understand, but not that there was anything that he<br>was frightened of saying or thinking. I have never been able to feel much<br>liking for Gandhi, but I do not feel sure that as a political thinker he<br>was wrong in the main, nor do I believe that his life was a failure. It<br>is curious that when he was assassinated, many of his warmest admirers<br>exclaimed sorrowfully that he had lived just long enough to see his life<br>work in ruins, because India was engaged in a civil war which had always<br>been foreseen as one of the byproducts of the transfer of power. But it<br>was not in trying to smooth down Hindu-Moslem rivalry that Gandhi had<br>spent his life. His main political objective, the peaceful ending of<br>British rule, had after all been attained. As usual the relevant facts<br>cut across one another. On the other hand, the British did get out of<br>India without fighting, and event which very few observers indeed would<br>have predicted until about a year before it happened. On the other hand,<br>this was done by a Labour government, and it is certain that a<br>Conservative government, especially a government headed by Churchill,<br>would have acted differently. But if, by 1945, there had grown up in<br>Britain a large body of opinion sympathetic to Indian independence, how<br>far was this due to Gandhi's personal influence? And if, as may happen,<br>India and Britain finally settle down into a decent and friendly<br>relationship, will this be partly because Gandhi, by keeping up his<br>struggle obstinately and without hatred, disinfected the political air?<br>That one even thinks of asking such questions indicates his stature. One<br>may feel, as I do, a sort of aesthetic distaste for Gandhi, one may<br>reject the claims of sainthood made on his behalf (he never made any such<br>claim himself, by the way), one may also reject sainthood as an ideal and<br>therefore feel that Gandhi's basic aims were anti-human and reactionary:<br>but regarded simply as a politician, and compared with the other leading<br>political figures of our time, how clean a smell he has managed to leave<br>behind.<br><br></font></p>
