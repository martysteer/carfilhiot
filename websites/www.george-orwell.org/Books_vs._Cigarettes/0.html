<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">A couple of years ago a friend of mine, a newspaper editor, was<br>firewatching with some factory workers. They fell to talking about his<br>newspaper, which most of them read and approved of, but when he asked<br>them what they thought of the literary section, the answer he got was:<br>"You don't suppose we read that stuff, do you? Why, half the time you're<br>talking about books that cost twelve and sixpence! Chaps like us couldn't<br>spend twelve and sixpence on a book." These, he said, were men who thought<br>nothing of spending several pounds on a day trip to Blackpool.<br><br>This idea that the buying, or even the reading, of books is an expensive<br>hobby and beyond the reach of the average person is so widespread that<br>it deserves some detailed examination. Exactly what reading costs,<br>reckoned in terms of pence per hour, is difficult to estimate, but I have<br>made a start by inventorying my own books and adding up their total price.<br>After allowing for various other expenses, I can make a fairly good guess<br>at my expenditure over the last fifteen years.<br><br>The books that I have counted and priced are the ones I have here,<br>in my flat. I have about an equal number stored in another place, so that<br>I shall double the final figure in order to arrive at the complete amount.<br>I have not counted oddments such as proof copies, defaced volumes, cheap<br>paper-covered editions, pamphlets, or magazines, unless bound up into<br>book form. Nor have I counted the kind of junky books-old school<br>text-books and so forth--that accumulate in the bottoms of cupboards.<br>I have counted only those books which I have acquired voluntarily,<br>or else would have acquired voluntarily, and which I intend to keep.<br>In this category I find that I have 442 books, acquired in the<br>following ways:<br><br><br>Bought (mostly second-hand)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;251<br>Given to me or bought with book tokens&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  33<br>Review copies and complimentary copies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 143<br>Borrowed and not returned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   10<br>Temporarily on loan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  5<br>   Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   442<br><br><br>Now as to the method of pricing. Those books that I have bought I have<br>listed at their full price, as closely as I can determine it.<br>I have also listed at their full price the books that have been given<br>to me, and those that I have temporarily borrowed, or borrowed and kept.<br>This is because book-giving, book-borrowing and bookstealing more or<br>less even out. I possess books that do not strictly speaking belong<br>to me, but many other people also have books of mine: so that the books<br>I have not paid for can be taken as balancing others which I have paid<br>for but no longer possess. On the other hand I have listed the review and<br>complimentary copies at half-price. That is about what I would have paid<br>for them second-hand, and they are mostly books that I would only have<br>bought second-hand, if at all. For the prices I have sometimes had to<br>rely on guesswork, but my figures will not be far out. The costs were<br>as follows:<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £   s.   d.<br>Bought&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br>Gifts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   10   10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br>Review copies, etc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  25   11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br>Borrowed and not returned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4   16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br>On loan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  3   10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br>Shelves&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br>   Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82   17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br><br><br>Adding the other batch of books that I have elsewhere, it seems that I<br>possess altogether nearly 900 books, at a cost of £165 15s. This is the<br>accumulation of about fifteen years--actually more, since some of these<br>books date from my childhood: but call it fifteen years. This works out<br>at £11 Is. a year, but there are other charges that must be added in<br>order to estimate my full reading expenses. The biggest will be for<br>newspapers and periodicals, and for this I think £8 a year would be<br>a reasonable figure. Eight pounds a year covers the cost of two daily<br>papers, one evening paper, two Sunday papers, one weekly review and<br>one or two monthly magazines. This brings the figure up to £19 1s, but<br>to arrive at the grand total one has to make a guess. Obviously one often<br>spends money on books without afterwards having anything to show for it.<br>There are library subscriptions, and there are also the books, chiefly<br>Penguins and other cheap editions, which one buys and then loses or<br>throws away. However, on the basis of my other figures, it looks as<br>though £6 a year would be quite enough to add for expenditure of this<br>kind. So my total reading expenses over the past fifteen years have been<br>in the neighbourhood of £25 a year.<br><br>Twenty-five pounds a year sounds quite a lot until you begin to measure<br>it against other kinds of expenditure. It is nearly 9s 9d a week, and<br>at present 9s 9d is the equivalent of about 83 cigarettes (Players):<br>even before the war it would have bought you less than 200 cigarettes.<br>With prices as they now are, I am spending far more on tobacco than I do<br>on books. I smoke six ounces a week, at half-a-crown an ounce, making<br>nearly £40 a year. Even before the war when the same tobacco cost 8d an<br>ounce, I was spending over £10 a year on it: and if I also averaged a<br>pint of beer a day, at sixpence, these two items together will have cost<br>me close on £20 a year. This was probably not much above the national<br>average. In 1938 the people of this country spent nearly £10 per head per<br>annum on alcohol and tobacco: however, 20 per cent of the population were<br>children under fifteen and another 40 per cent were women, so that the<br>average smoker and drinker must have been spending much more than<br>£10. In 1944, the annual expenditure per head on these items was no less<br>than £23. Allow for the women and children as before, and £40 is a<br>reasonable individual figure. Forty pounds a year would just about pay<br>for a packet of Woodbines every day and half a pint of mild six days<br>a week--not a magnificent allowance. Of course, all prices are now<br>inflated, including the price of books: still, it looks as though the<br>cost of reading, even if you buy books instead of borrowing them and<br>take in a fairly large number of periodicals, does not amount to more<br>than the combined cost of smoking and drinking.<br><br>It is difficult to establish any relationship between the price of books<br>and the value one gets out of them. "Books" includes novels, poetry, text<br>books, works of reference, sociological treatises and much else, and<br>length and price do not correspond to one another, especially if one<br>habitually buys books second-hand. You may spend ten shillings on a<br>poem of 500 lines, and you may spend sixpence on a dictionary which<br>you consult at odd moments over a period of twenty years. There are<br>books that one reads over and over again, books that become part of<br>the furniture of one's mind and alter one's whole attitude to life,<br>books that one dips into but never reads through, books that one reads<br>at a single sitting and forgets a week later: and the cost, in terms<br>of money, may be the same in each case. But if one regards reading<br>simply as a recreation, like going to the pictures, then it is possible<br>to make a rough estimate of what it costs. If you read nothing but novels<br>and "light" literature, and bought every book that you read, you would<br>be spending-allowing eight shillings as the price of a book, and four<br>hours as the time spent in reading it-two shillings an hour. This is<br>about what it costs to sit in one of the more expensive seats in the<br>cinema. If you concentrated on more serious books, and still bought<br>everything that you read, your expenses would be about the same.<br>The books would cost more but they would take longer to read. In either<br>case you would still possess the books after you had read them, and<br>they would be saleable at about a third of their purchase price. If<br>you bought only second-hand books, your reading expenses would, of<br>course, be much less: perhaps sixpence an hour would be a fair estimate.<br>And on the other hand if you don't buy books, but merely borrow them<br>from the lending library, reading costs you round about a halfpenny an<br>hour: if you borrow them from the public library, it costs you next door<br>to nothing.<br><br>I have said enough to show that reading is one of the cheaper recreations:<br>after listening to the radio probably THE cheapest. Meanwhile, what is<br>the actual amount that the British public spends on books? I cannot<br>discover any figures, though no doubt they exist. But I do know that<br>before the war this country was publishing annually about 15,000 books,<br>which included reprints and school books. If as many as 10,000 copies<br>of each book were sold--and even allowing for the school books, this<br>is probably a high estimate-the average person was only buying, directly<br>or indirectly, about three books a year. These three books taken together<br>might cost £1, or probably less.<br><br>These figures are guesswork, and I should be interested if someone<br>would correct them for me. But if my estimate is anywhere near right,<br>it is not a proud record for a country which is nearly 100 per cent<br>literate and where the ordinary man spends more on cigarettes than an<br>Indian peasant has for his whole livelihood. And if our book consumption<br>remains as low as it has been, at least let us admit that it is because<br>reading is a less exciting pastime than going to the dogs, the pictures<br>or the pub, and not because books, whether bought or borrowed, are too<br>expensive.<br><br></font></p>
