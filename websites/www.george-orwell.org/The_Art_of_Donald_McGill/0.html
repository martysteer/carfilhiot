<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Who does not know the 'comics' of the cheap stationers' windows, the<br>penny or twopenny coloured post cards with their endless succession of<br>fat women in tight bathing-dresses and their crude drawing and unbearable<br>colours, chiefly hedge-sparrow's-egg tint and Post Office red?<br><br>This question ought to be rhetorical, but it is curious fact that many<br>people seem to be unaware of the existence of these things, or else to<br>have a vague notion that they are something to be found only at the<br>seaside, like nigger minstrels or peppermint rock. Actually they are on<br>sale everywhere--they can be bought at nearly any Woolworth's, for<br>example--and they are evidently produced in enormous numbers, new series<br>constantly appearing. They are not to be confused with the various other<br>types of comic illustrated post card, such as the sentimental ones<br>dealing with puppies and kittens or the Wendyish, sub-pornographic ones<br>which exploit the love affairs of children. They are a genre of their<br>own, specializing in very 'low' humour, the mother-in-law, baby's-nappy,<br>policemen's-boot type of joke, and distinguishable from all the other<br>kinds by having no artistic pretensions. Some half-dozen publishing<br>houses issue them, though the people who draw them seem not to be<br>numerous at any one time.<br><br>I have associated them especially with the name of Donald McGill because<br>he is not only the most prolific and by far the best of contemporary post<br>card artists, but also the most representative, the most perfect in the<br>tradition. Who Donald McGill is, I do not know. He is apparently a trade<br>name, for at least one series of post cards is issued simply as 'The<br>Donald McGill Comics', but he is also unquestionable a real person with a<br>style of drawing which is recognizable at a glance. Anyone who examines<br>his post cards in bulk will notice that many of them are not despicable<br>even as drawings, but it would be mere dilettantism to pretend that they<br>have any direct aesthetic value. A comic post card is simply an<br>illustration to a joke, invariably a 'low' joke, and it stands or falls<br>by its ability to raise a laugh. Beyond that it has only 'ideological'<br>interest. McGill is a clever draughtsman with a real caricaturist's touch<br>in the drawing of faces, but the special value of his post cards is that<br>they are so completely typical. They represent, as it were, the norm of<br>the comic post card. Without being in the least imitative, they are<br>exactly what comic post cards have been any time these last forty years,<br>and from them the meaning and purpose of the whole genre can be inferred.<br><br>Get hold of a dozen of these things, preferably McGill's--if you pick<br>out from a pile the ones that seem to you funniest, you will probably<br>find that most of them are McGill's--and spread them out on a table.<br>What do you see?<br><br>Your first impression is of overpowering vulgarity. This is quite apart<br>from the ever-present obscenity, and apart also from the hideousness of<br>the colours. They have an utter low-ness of mental atmosphere which comes<br>out not only in the nature of the jokes but, even more, in the grotesque,<br>staring, blatant quality of the drawings. The designs, like those of a<br>child, are full of heavy lines and empty spaces, and all the figures in<br>them, every gesture and attitude, are deliberately ugly, the faces<br>grinning and vacuous, the women monstrously paradied, with bottoms like<br>Hottentots. Your second impression, however, is of indefinable<br>familiarity. What do these things remind you of? What are they'so like?<br>In the first place, of course, they remind you of the barely different<br>post cards which you probably gazed at in your childhood. But more than<br>this, what you are really looking at is something as traditional as Greek<br>tragedy, a sort of sub-world of smacked bottoms and scrawny<br>mothers-in-law which is a part of Western European consciousness. Not<br>that the jokes, taken one by one, are necessarily stale. Not being<br>debarred from smuttiness, comic post cards repeat themselves less often<br>than the joke columns in reputable magazines, but their basic<br>subject-matter, the KIND of joke they are aiming at, never varies. A few<br>are genuinely witty, in a Max Millerish style. Examples:<br><br><br>'I like seeing experienced girls home.'<br><br>'But I'm not experienced!'<br><br>'You're not home yet!'<br><br><br>'I've been struggling for years to get a fur coat. How did you get yours?'<br><br>'I left off struggling.'<br><br><br>J U D G E : 'You are prevaricating, sir. Did you or did you not sleep<br>with this woman?'<br><br>Co--respondent: 'Not a wink, my lord!'<br><br><br>In general, however, they are not witty, but humorous, and it must be<br>said for McGill's post cards, in particular, that the drawing is often a<br>good deal funnier than the joke beneath it. Obviously the outstanding<br>characteristic of comic cards is their obscenity, and I must discuss that<br>more fully later. But I give here a rough analysis of their habitual<br>subject-matter, with such explanatory remarks as seem to be needed:<br><br>SEX.--More than half, perhaps three-quarters, of the jokes are sex<br>jokes, ranging from the harmless to the all but unprintable. First<br>favourite is probably the illegitimate baby. Typical captions: 'Could you<br>exchange this lucky charm for a baby's feeding-bottle?' 'She didn't ask<br>me to the christening, so I'm not going to the wedding.' Also newlyweds,<br>old maids, nude statues and women in bathing-dresses. All of these are<br>IPSO FACTO funny, mere mention of them being enough to raise a laugh. The<br>cuckoldry joke is seldom exploited, and there are no references to<br>homosexuality.<br><br>Conventions of the sex joke:<br><br>(i) Marriage only benefits women. Every man is plotting seduction and<br>every woman is plotting marriage. No woman ever remained unmarried<br>voluntarily.<br><br>(ii) Sex-appeal vanishes at about the age of twenty-five. Well-preserved<br>and good-looking people beyond their first youth are never represented.<br>The amorous honeymooning couple reappear as the grim-visaged wife and<br>shapeless, moustachioed, red-nosed husband, no intermediate stage being<br>allowed for.<br><br>HOME LIFE--Next to sex, the henpecked husband is the favourite joke.<br>Typical caption: 'Did they get an X-ray of your wife's jaw at the<br>hospital?'--'No, they got a moving picture instead.'<br><br>Conventions:<br><br>(i) There is no such thing as a happy marriage.<br><br>(ii) No man ever gets the better of a woman in argument.<br>Drunkenness--Both drunkenness and teetotalism are ipso facto funny.<br><br>Conventions:<br><br>(i) All drunken men have optical illusions.<br><br>(ii) Drunkenness is something peculiar to middle-aged men. Drunken youths<br>or women are never represented.<br><br>W.C. JOKES--There is not a large number of these. Chamber pots are ipso<br>facto funny, and so are public lavatories. A typical post card captioned<br>'A Friend in Need', shows a man's hat blown off his head and disappearing<br>down the steps of a ladies' lavatory.<br><br>INTER-WORKING-CLASS SNOBBERY--Much in these post cards suggests that<br>they are aimed at the better-off working class and poorer middle class.<br>There are many jokes turning on malapropisms, illiteracy, dropped aitches<br>and the rough manners of slum dwellers. Countless post cards show<br>draggled hags of the stage-charwoman type exchanging 'unladylike' abuse.<br>Typical repartee: 'I wish you were a statue and I was a pigeon!' A<br>certain number produced since the war treat evacuation from the<br>anti-evacuee angle. There are the usual jokes about tramps, beggars and<br>criminals, and the comic maidservant appears fairly frequently. Also the<br>comic navvy, bargee, etc.; but there are no anti-Trade-Union jokes.<br>Broadly speaking, everyone with much over or much under £5 a week is<br>regarded as laughable. The 'swell' is almost as automatically a figure of<br>fun as the slum-dweller.<br><br>STOCK FIGURES--Foreigners seldom or never appear. The chief locality<br>joke is the Scotsman, who is almost inexhaustible. The lawyer is always a<br>swindler, the clergyman always a nervous idiot who says the wrong thing.<br>The 'knut' or 'masher' still appears, almost as in Edwardian days, in<br>out-of-date looking evening-clothes and an opera hat, or even spats and a<br>knobby cane. Another survival is the Suffragette, one of the big jokes of<br>the pre-1914 period and too valuable to be relinquished. She has<br>reappeared, unchanged in physical appearance, as the Feminist lecturer or<br>Temperance fanatic. A feature of the last few years is the complete<br>absence of anti-Jew post cards. The 'Jew joke', always somewhat more<br>ill-natured than the 'Scotch joke', disappeared abruptly soon after the<br>rise of Hitler.<br><br>POLITICS--Any contemporary event, cult or activity which has comic<br>possibilities (for example, 'free love', feminism, A.R.P., nudism)<br>rapidly finds its way into the picture post cards, but their general<br>atmosphere is extremely old-fashioned. The implied political outlook is a<br>Radicalism appropriate to about the year 1900. At normal times they are<br>not only not patriotic, but go in for a mild guying of patriotism, with<br>jokes about 'God save the King', the Union Jack, etc. The European<br>situation only began to reflect itself in them at some time in 1939, and<br>first did so through the comic aspects of A.R.P. Even at this date few<br>post cards mention the war except in A.R.P. jokes (fat woman stuck in the<br>mouth of Anderson shelter: wardens neglecting their duty while young<br>woman undresses at window she has forgotten to black out, etc., etc.) A<br>few express anti-Hitler sentiments of a not very vindictive kind. One,<br>not McGill's, shows Hitler with the usual hypertrophied backside, bending<br>down to pick a flower. Caption; 'What would you do, chums?' This is about<br>as high a flight of patriotism as any post card is likely to attain.<br>Unlike the twopenny weekly papers, comic post cards are not the product<br>of any great monopoly company, and evidendy they are not regarded as<br>having any importance in forming public opinion. There is no sign in them<br>of any attempt to induce an outlook acceptable to the ruling class.<br><br><br><br>Here one comes back to the outstanding, all-important feature of comic<br>post cards--their obscenity. It is by this that everyone remembers them,<br>and it is also central to their purpose, though not in a way diat is<br>immediately obvious.<br><br>A recurrent, almost dominant motif in comic post cards is the woman with<br>the stuck-out behind. In perhaps half of them, or more than half, even<br>when the point of the joke has nothing to do with sex, the same female<br>figure appears, a plump 'voluptuous' figure with the dress clinging to it<br>as tightly as another skin and with breasts or buttocks grossly<br>over-emphasized according to which way it is turned. There can be no<br>doubt that these pictures lift the lid off a very widespread repression,<br>natural enough in a country whose women when young tend to be slim to the<br>point of skimpiness. But at the same time the McGill post card--and this<br>applies to all other post cards in this genre--is not intended as<br>pornography but, a subtler thing, as a skit on pornography. The Hottentot<br>figures of the women are caricatures of the Englishman's secret ideal,<br>not portraits of it. When one examines McGill's post cards more closely,<br>one notices that his brand of humour only has a meaning in relation to a<br>fairly strict moral code. Whereas in papers like ESQUIRE, for instance,<br>or LA VIE PARISIENNE, the imaginary background of the jokes is always<br>promiscuity, the utter breakdown of all standards, the background of the<br>McGill post card is marriage. The four leading jokes are nakedness,<br>illegitimate babies, old maids and newly married couples, none of which<br>would seem funny in a really dissolute or even 'sophisticated' society.<br>The post cards dealing with honeymoon couples always have the<br>enthusiastic indecency of those village weddings where it is still<br>considered screamingly funny to sew bells to the bridal bed. In one, for<br>example, a young bridegroom is shown getting out of bed the morning after<br>his wedding night. 'The first morning in our own little home, darling!'<br>he is saying; 'I'll go and get the milk and paper and bring you up a cup<br>of tea.' Inset is a picture of the front doorstep; on it are four<br>newspapers and four bottles of milk. This is obscene, if you like, but it<br>is not immoral. Its implication--and this is just the implication the<br>ESQUIRE or the NEW YORKER would avoid at all costs--is that marriage is<br>something profoundly exciting and important, the biggest event in the<br>average human being's life.<br><br>So also with jokes about nagging wives and tyrannous mothers-in-law. They<br>do at least imply a stable society in which marriage is indissoluble and<br>family loyalty taken for granted. And bound up with this is something I<br>noted earlier, the fact there are no pictures, or hardly any, of<br>good-looking people beyond their first youth. There is the 'spooning'<br>couple and the middle-aged, cat-and-dog couple, but nothing in between.<br>The liaison, the illicit but more or less decorous love-affair which used<br>to be the stock joke of French comic papers, is not a post card subject.<br>And this reflects, on a comic level, the working-class outlook which<br>takes it as a matter of course that youth and adventure--almost, indeed,<br>individual life--end with marriage. One of the few authentic<br>class-differences, as opposed to class-distinctions, still existing in<br>England is that the working classes age very much earlier. They do not<br>live less long, provided that they survive their childhood, nor do they<br>lose their physical activity earlier, but they do lose very early their<br>youthful appearance. This fact is observable everywhere, but can be most<br>easily verified by watching one of the higher age groups registering for<br>military service; the middle--and upper-class members look, on average,<br>ten years younger than the others. It is usual to attribute this to the<br>harder lives that the working classes have to live, but it is doubtful<br>whether any such difference now exists as would account for it. More<br>probably the truth is that the working classes reach middle age earlier<br>because they accept it earlier. For to look young after, say, thirty is<br>largely a matter of wanting to do so. This generalization is less true of<br>the better-paid workers, especially those who live in council houses and<br>labour-saving flats, but it is true enough even of them to point to a<br>difference of outlook. And in this, as usual, they are more traditional,<br>more in accord with the Christian past than the well-to-do women who try<br>to stay young at forty by means of physical-jerks, cosmetics and<br>avoidance of child-bearing. The impulse to cling to youth at all costs,<br>to attempt to preserve your sexual attraction, to see even in middle age<br>a future for yourself and not merely for your children, is a thing of<br>recent growth and has only precariously established itself. It will<br>probably disappear again when our standard of living drops and our<br>birth-rate rises. 'Youth's a stuff will not endure' expresses the normal,<br>traditional attitude. It is this ancient wisdom that McGill and his<br>colleagues are reflecting, no doubt unconsciously, when they allow for no<br>transition stage between the honeymoon couple and those glamourless<br>figures, Mum and Dad.<br><br>I have said that at least half of McGill's post cards are sex jokes, and<br>a proportion, perhaps ten per cent, are far more obscene than anything<br>else that is now printed in England. Newsagents are occasionally<br>prosecuted for selling them, and there would be many more prosecutions if<br>the broadest jokes were not invariably protected by double meanings. A<br>single example will be enough to show how this is done. In one post card,<br>captioned 'They didn't believe her', a young woman is demonstrating, with<br>her hands held apart, something about two feet long to a couple of<br>open-mouthed acquaintances. Behind her on the wall is a stuffed fish in a<br>glass case, and beside that is a photograph of a nearly naked athlete.<br>Obviously it is not the fish that she is referring to, but this could<br>never be proved. Now, it is doubtful whether there is any paper in<br>England that would print a joke of this kind, and certainly there is no<br>paper that does so habitually. There is an immense amount of pornography<br>of a mild sort, countless illustrated papers cashing in on women's legs,<br>but there is no popular literature specializing in the 'vulgar', farcical<br>aspect of sex. On the other hand, jokes exactly like McGill's are the<br>ordinary small change of the revue and music-hall stage, and are also to<br>be heard on the radio, at moments when the censor happens to be nodding.<br>In England the gap between what can be said and what can be printed is<br>rather exceptionally wide. Remarks and gestures which hardly anyone<br>objects to on the stage would raise a public outcry if any attempt were<br>made to reproduce them on paper. (Compare Max Miller's stage patter with<br>his weekly column in the SUNDAY DISPATCH) The comic post cards are the<br>only existing exception to this rule, the only medium in which really<br>'low' humour is considered to be printable. Only in post cards and on the<br>variety stage can the stuck-out behind, dog and lamp-post, baby's nappy<br>type of joke be freely exploited. Remembering that, one sees what<br>function these post cards, in their humble way, are performing.<br><br>What they are doing is to give expression to the Sancho Panza view of<br>life, the attitude to life that Miss Rebecca West once summed up as<br>'extracting as much fun as possible from smacking behinds in basement<br>kitchens'. The Don Quixote-Sancho Panza combination, which of course is<br>simply the ancient dualism of body and soul in fiction form, recurs more<br>frequently in the literature of the last four hundred years than can be<br>explained by mere imitation. It comes up again and again, in endless<br>variations, Bouvard and Pécuchet, Jeeves and Wooster, Bloom and Dedalus,<br>Holmes and Watson (the Holmes-Watson variant is an exceptionally subtle<br>one, because the usual physical characteristics of two partners have been<br>transposed). Evidently it corresponds to something enduring in our<br>civilization, not in the sense that either character is to be found in a<br>'pure' state in real life, but in the sense that the two principles,<br>noble folly and base wisdom, exist side by side in nearly every human<br>being. If you look into your own mind, which are you, Don Quixote or<br>Sancho Panza? Almost certainly you are both. There is one part of you<br>that wishes to be a hero or a saint, but another part of you is a little<br>fat man who sees very clearly the advantages of staying alive with a<br>whole skin. He is your unofficial self, the voice of the belly protesting<br>against the soul. His tastes lie towards safety, soft beds, no work, pots<br>of beer and women with 'voluptuous' figures. He it is who punctures your<br>fine attitudes and urges you to look after Number One, to be unfaithful<br>to your wife, to bilk your debts, and so on and so forth. Whether you<br>allow yourself to be influenced by him is a different question. But it is<br>simply a lie to say that he is not part of you, just as it is a lie to<br>say that Don Quixote is not part of you either, though most of what is<br>said and written consists of one lie or the other, usually the first.<br><br>But though in varying forms he is one of the stock figures of literature,<br>in real life, especially in the way society is ordered, his point of view<br>never gets a fair hearing. There is a constant world-wide conspiracy to<br>pretend that he is not there, or at least that he doesn't matter. Codes<br>of law and morals, or religious systems, never have much room in them for<br>a humorous view of life. Whatever is funny is subversive, every joke is<br>ultimately a custard pie, and the reason why so large a proportion of<br>jokes centre round obscenity is simply that all societies, as the price<br>of survival, have to insist on a fairly high standard of sexual morality.<br>A dirty joke is not, of course, a serious attack upon morality, but it is<br>a sort of mental rebellion, a momentary wish that things were otherwise.<br>So also with all other jokes, which always centre round cowardice,<br>laziness, dishonesty or some other quality which society cannot afford to<br>encourage. Society has always to demand a little more from human beings<br>than it will get in practice. It has to demand faultless discipline and<br>self-sacrifice, it must expect its subjects to work hard, pay their<br>taxes, and be faithful to their wives, it must assume that men think it<br>glorious to die on the battlefield and women want wear themselves out<br>with child-bearing. The whole of what one may call official literature is<br>founded on such assumptions. I never read the proclamations of generals<br>before battle, the speeches of flihrers and prime ministers, the<br>solidarity songs of public schools and left-wing political parties,<br>national anthems, Temperance tracts, papal encyclicals and sermons<br>against gambling and contraception, without seeming to hear in the<br>background a chorus of raspberries from all the millions of common men to<br>whom these high sentiments make no appeal. Nevertheless the high<br>sentiments always win in the end, leaders who offer blood, toil, tears<br>and sweat always get more out of their followers than those who offer<br>safety and a good time. When it comes to the pinch, human beings are<br>heroic. Women face childbed and the scrubbing brush, revolutionaries keep<br>their mouths shut in the torture chamber, battleships go down with their<br>guns still firing when their decks are awash. It is only that the other<br>element in man, the lazy, cowardly, debt-bilking adulterer who is inside<br>all of us, can never be suppressed altogether and needs a hearing<br>occasionally.<br><br>The comic post cards are one expression of his point of view, a humble<br>one, less important than the music halls, but still worthy of attention.<br>In a society which is still basically Christian they naturally<br>concentrate on sex jokes; in a totalitarian society, if they had any<br>freedom of expression at all, they would probably concentrate on laziness<br>or cowardice, but at any rate on the unheroic in one form or another. It<br>will not do to condemn them on the ground that they are vulgar and ugly.<br>That is exactly what they are meant to be. Their whole meaning and virtue<br>is in their unredeemed low-ness, not only in the sense of obscenity, but<br>lowness of outlook in every direction whatever. The slightest hint of<br>'higher' influences would ruin them utterly. They stand for the<br>worm's-eye view of life, for the music-hall world where marriage is a<br>dirty joke or a comic disaster, where the rent is always behind and the<br>clothes are always up the spout, where the lawyer is always a crook and<br>the Scotsman always a miser, where the newly-weds make fools of<br>themselves on the hideous beds of seaside lodging-houses and the drunken,<br>red-nosed husbands roll home at four in the morning to meet the<br>linen-nightgowned wives who wait for them behind the front door, poker in<br>hand. Their existence, the fact that people want them, is symptomatically<br>important. Like the music halls, they are a sort of saturnalia, a<br>harmless rebellion against virtue. They express only one tendency in the<br>human mind, but a tendency which is always there and will find its own<br>outlet, like water. On the whole, human beings want to be good, but not<br>too good, and not quite all the time. For:<br><br><br>there is a just man that perished in his righteousness, and there is a<br>wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. Be not righteous<br>overmuch; neither make thyself over wise; why shouldst thou destroy<br>thyself? Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldst<br>thou die before thy time?<br><br><br>In the past the mood of the comic post card could enter into the central<br>stream of literature, and jokes barely different from McGill's could<br>casually be uttered between the murders in Shakespeare's tragedies. That<br>is no longer possible, and a whole category of humour, integral to our<br>literature till 1800 or thereabouts, has dwindled down to these ill-drawn<br>post cards, leading a barely legal existence in cheap stationers'<br>windows. The corner of the human heart that they speak for might easily<br>manifest itself in worse forms, and I for one should be sorry to see them<br>vanish.<br><br></font></p>
