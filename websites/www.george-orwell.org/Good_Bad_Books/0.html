<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Not long ago a publisher commissioned me to write an introduction for a<br>reprint of a novel by Leonard Merrick. This publishing house, it appears,<br>is going to reissue a long series of minor and partly-forgotten novels of<br>the twentieth century. It is a valuable service in these bookless days,<br>and I rather envy the person whose job it will be to scout round the<br>threepenny boxes, hunting down copies of his boyhood favourites.<br><br>A type of book which we hardly seem to produce in these days, but which<br>flowered with great richness in the late nineteenth and early twentieth<br>centuries, is what Chesterton called the "good bad book": that is, the<br>kind of book that has no literary pretensions but which remains readable<br>when more serious productions have perished. Obviously outstanding books<br>in this line are RAFFLES and the Sherlock Holmes stories, which have kept<br>their place when innumerable "problem novels", "human documents" and<br>"terrible indictments" of this or that have fallen into deserved<br>oblivion. (Who has worn better, Conan Doyle or Meredith?) Almost in the<br>same class as these I, put R. Austin Freeman's earlier stories--"The<br>Singing Bone" "The Eye of Osiris" and others--Ernest Bramah's MAX<br>CARRADOS, and, dropping the standard a bit, Guy Boothby's Tibetan<br>thriller, DR NIKOLA, a sort of schoolboy version of Hue's TRAVELS IN<br>TARTARY, which would probably make a real visit to Central Asia seem a<br>dismal anticlimax.<br><br>But apart from thrillers, there were the minor humorous writers of the<br>period. For example, Pett Ridge-but I admit his full-length books no<br>longer seem readable--E. Nesbit (THE TREASURE SEEKERS), George<br>Birmingham, who was good so long as he kept off politics, the<br>pornographic Binstead ("Pitcher" of the PINK 'UN), and, if American books<br>can be included, Booth Tarkington's Penrod stories. A cut above most of<br>these was Barry Pain. Some of Pain's humorous writings are, I suppose,<br>still in print, but to anyone who comes across it I recommend what must<br>now be a very rare book--THE OCTAVE OF CLAUDIUS, a brilliant exercise in<br>the macabre. Somewhat later in time there was Peter Blundell, who wrote<br>in the W.W. Jacobs vein about Far Eastern seaport towns, and who seems to<br>be rather unaccountably forgotten, in spite of having been praised in<br>print by H.G. Wells.<br><br>However, all the books I have been speaking of are frankly "escape"<br>literature. They form pleasant patches in one's memory, quiet corners<br>where the mind can browse at odd moments, but they hardly pretend to have<br>anything to do with real life. There is another kind of good bad book<br>which is more seriously intended, and which tells us, I think, something<br>about the nature of the novel and the reasons for its present decadence.<br>During the last fifty years there has been a whole series of writers--some<br>of them are still writing--whom it is quite impossible to call "good" by<br>any strictly literary standard, but who are natural novelists and who<br>seem to attain sincerity partly because they are not inhibited by good<br>taste. In this class I put Leonard Merrick himself, W.L. George, J.D.<br>Beresford, Ernest Raymond, May Sinclair, and--at a lower level than the<br>others but still essentially similar--A.S.M. Hutchinson.<br><br>Most of these have been prolific writers, and their output has naturally<br>varied in quality. I am thinking in each case of one or two outstanding<br>books: for example, Merrick's CYNTHIA, J.D. Beresford's A CANDIDATE FOR<br>TRUTH, W.L. George's CALIBAN, May Sinclair's THE COMBINED MAZE and Ernest<br>Raymond's WE, THE ACCUSED. In each of these books the author has been<br>able to identify himself with his imagined characters, to feel with them<br>and invite sympathy on their behalf. with a kind of abandonment that<br>cleverer people would find it difficult to achieve. They bring out the<br>fact that intellectual refinement can be a disadvantage to a<br>story-teller, as it would be to a music-hall comedian.<br><br>Take, for example, Ernest Raymond's WE, THE ACCUSED--a peculiarly sordid<br>and convincing murder story, probably based on the Crippen case. I think<br>it gains a great deal from the fact that the author only partly grasps<br>the pathetic vulgarity of the people he is writing about, and therefore<br>does not despise them. Perhaps it even--like Theodore Dreiser's An<br>AMERICAN TRAGEDY--gains something from the clumsy long-winded manner in<br>which it is written; detail is piled on detail, with almost no attempt at<br>selection, and in the process an effect of terrible, grinding cruelty is<br>slowly built up. So also with A CANDIDATE FOR TRUTH. Here there is not<br>the same clumsiness, but there is the same ability to take seriously the<br>problems of commonplace people. So also with CYNTHIA and at any rate the<br>earlier part of Caliban. The greater part of what W.L. George wrote was<br>shoddy rubbish, but in this particular book, based on the career of<br>Northcliffe, he achieved some memorable and truthful pictures of<br>lower-middle-class London life. Parts of this book are probably<br>autobiographical, and one of the advantages of good bad writers is their<br>lack of shame in writing autobiography. Exhibitionism and self-pity are<br>the bane of the novelist, and yet if he is too frightened of them his<br>creative gift may suffer.<br><br>The existence of good bad literature--the fact that one can be amused or<br>excited or even moved by a book that one's intellect simply refuses to<br>take seriously--is a reminder that art is not the same thing as<br>cerebration. I imagine that by any test that could be devised, Carlyle<br>would be found to be a more intelligent man than Trollope. Yet Trollope<br>has remained readable and Carlyle has not: with all his cleverness he had<br>not even the wit to write in plain straightforward English. In novelists,<br>almost as much as in poets, the connection between intelligence and<br>creative power is hard to establish. A good novelist may be a prodigy of<br>self-discipline like Flaubert, or he may be an intellectual sprawl like<br>Dickens. Enough talent to set up dozens of ordinary writers has been<br>poured into Wyndham Lewis's so-called novels, such as TARR or SNOOTY<br>BARONET. Yet it would be a very heavy labour to read one of these books<br>right through. Some indefinable quality, a sort of literary vitamin,<br>which exists even in a book like IF WINTER COMES, is absent from them.<br><br>Perhaps the supreme example of the "good bad" book is UNCLE TOM'S CABIN.<br>It is an unintentionally ludicrous book, full of preposterous<br>melodramatic incidents; it is also deeply moving and essentially<br>true; it is hard to say which quality outweighs the other. But<br>UNCLE TOM'S CABIN, after all, is trying to be serious and to deal<br>with the real world. How about the frankly escapist writers, the<br>purveyors of thrills and "light" humour? How about SHERLOCK HOLMES, VICE<br>VERSA, DRACULA, HELEN'S BABIES or KING SOLOMON'S MINES? All of these are<br>definitely absurd books, books which one is more inclined to laugh AT<br>than WITH, and which were hardly taken seriously even by their authors;<br>yet they have survived, and will probably continue to do so. All one can<br>say is that, while civilisation remains such that one needs distraction<br>from time to time, "light" literature has its appointed place; also that<br>there is such a thing as sheer skill, or native grace, which may have<br>more survival value than erudition or intellectual power. There are<br>music-hall songs which are better poems than three-quarters of the stuff<br>that gets into the anthologies:<br><br><br>Come where the booze is cheaper,<br>Come where the pots hold more,<br>Come where the boss is a bit of a sport,<br>Come to the pub next door!<br><br>Or again:<br><br>Two lovely black eyes<br>Oh, what a surprise!<br>Only for calling another man wrong,<br>Two lovely black eyes!<br><br>I would far rather have written either of those than, say, "The Blessed<br>Damozel" or "Love in the Valley". And by the same token I would back<br>UNCLE TOM'S CABIN to outlive the complete works of Virginia Woolf or<br>George Moore, though I know of no strictly literary test which would show<br>where the superiority lies.<br><br></font></p>
