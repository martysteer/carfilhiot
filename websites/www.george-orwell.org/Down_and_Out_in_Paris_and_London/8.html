<h2>Chapter IX</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>For three more days we continued traipsing about looking for work,<br>coming home for diminishing meals of soup and bread in my bedroom. There<br>were now two gleams of hope. In the first place, Boris had heard of a<br>possible job at the Hotel X, near the Place de la Concorde, and in the<br>second, the PATRON of the new restaurant in the rue du Commerce had at last<br>come back. We went down in the afternoon and saw him. On the way Boris<br>talked of the vast fortunes we should make if we got this job, and on the<br>importance of making a good impression on the PATRON.<br><br>'Appearance--appearance is everything, MON AMI. Give me a new suit<br>and I will borrow a thousand francs by dinner-time. What a pity I did not<br>buy a collar when we had money. I turned my collar inside out this morning;<br>but what is the use, one side is as dirty as the other. Do you think I look<br>hungry, MON AMI?'<br><br>'You look pale.'<br><br>'Curse it, what can one do on bread and potatoes? It is fatal to look<br>hungry. It makes people want to kick you. Wait.'<br><br>He stopped at a jeweller's window and smacked his cheeks sharply to<br>bring the blood into them. Then, before the flush had faded, we hurried<br>into the restaurant and introduced ourselves to the PATRON.<br><br>The PATRON was a short, fattish, very dignified man with wavy grey<br>hair, dressed in a smart, double-breasted flannel suit and smelling of<br>scent. Boris told me that he too was an ex-colonel of the Russian Army. His<br>wife was there too, a horrid, fat Frenchwoman with a dead-white face and<br>scarlet lips, reminding me of cold veal and tomatoes. The PATRON greeted<br>Boris genially, and they talked together in Russian for a few minutes. I<br>stood in the background, preparing to tell some big lies about my<br>experience as a dish-washer.<br><br>Then the PATRON came over towards me. I shuffled uneasily, trying to<br>look servile. Boris had rubbed it into me that a PLONGEUR is a slave's<br>slave, and I expected the PATRON. to treat me like dirt. To my<br>astonishment, he seized me warmly by the hand.<br><br>'So you are an Englishman!' he exclaimed. 'But how charming! I need<br>not ask, then, whether you are a golfer?'<br><br>'MAIS CERTAINEMENT,' I said, seeing that this was expected of me.<br><br>'All my life I have wanted to play golf. Will you, my dear MONSIEUR,<br>be so kind as to show me a few of the principal strokes?'<br><br>Apparently this was the Russian way of doing business. The PATRON<br>listened attentively while I explained the difference between a driver and<br>an iron, and then suddenly informed me that it was all ENTENDU; Boris was<br>to be MAITRE D'HOTEL when the restaurant opened, and I PLONGEUR, with a<br>chance of rising to lavatory attendant if trade was good. When would the<br>restaurant open? I asked. 'Exactly a fortnight from today,' the PATRON<br>answered grandly (he had a manner of waving his hand and flicking off his<br>cigarette ash at the same time, which looked very grand), 'exactly a<br>fortnight from today, in time for lunch.' Then, with obvious pride, he<br>showed us over the restaurant.<br><br>It was a smallish place, consisting of a bar, a dining-room, and a<br>kitchen no bigger than the average bathroom. The PATRON was decorating it<br>in a trumpery 'picturesque' style (he called it 'LE NORMAND'; it was a<br>matter of sham beams stuck on the plaster, and the like) and proposed to<br>call it the Auberge de Jehan Cottard, to give a medieval effect. He had a<br>leaflet printed, full of lies about the historical associations of the<br>quarter, and this leaflet actually claimed, among other things, that there<br>had once been an inn on the site of the restaurant which was frequented by<br>Charlemagne. The PATRON was very pleased with this touch. He was also<br>having the bar decorated with indecent pictures by an artist from the<br>Salon. Finally he gave us each an expensive cigarette, and after some more<br>talk he went home.<br><br>I felt strongly that we should never get any good from this<br>restaurant. The PATRON had looked to me like a cheat, and, what was worse,<br>an incompetent cheat, and I had seen two unmistakable duns hanging about<br>the back door. But Boris, seeing himself a MAITRE D'HOTEL once more, would<br>not be discouraged.<br><br>'We've brought it off--only a fortnight to hold out. What is a<br>fortnight? JE M'EN F----. To think that in only three weeks I shall have my<br>mistress! Will she be dark or fair, I wonder? I don't mind, so long as she<br>is not too thin.'<br><br>Two bad days followed. We had only sixty centimes left, and we spent<br>it on half a pound of bread, with a piece of garlic to rub it with. The<br>point of rubbing garlic on bread is that the taste lingers and gives one<br>the illusion of having fed recently. We sat most of that day in the Jardin<br>des Plantes. Boris had shots with stones at the tame pigeons, but always<br>missed them, and after that we wrote dinner menus on the backs of<br>envelopes. We were too hungry even to try and think of anything except<br>food. I remember the dinner Boris finally selected for himself. It was: a<br>dozen oysters, bortch soup (the red, sweet, beetroot soup with cream on<br>top), crayfishes, a young chicken en CASSEROLE, beef with stewed plums, new<br>potatoes, a salad, suet pudding and Roquefort cheese, with a litre of<br>Burgundy and some old brandy. Boris had international tastes in food. Later<br>on, when we were prosperous, I occasionally saw him eat meals almost as<br>large without difficulty.<br><br>When our money came to an end I stopped looking for work, and was<br>another day without food. I did not believe that the Auberge de Jehan<br>Cottard was really going to open, and I could see no other prospect, but I<br>was too lazy to do anything but lie in bed. Then the luck changed abruptly.<br>At night, at about ten o'clock, I heard an eager shout from the street. I<br>got up and went to the window. Boris was there, waving his stick and<br>beaming. Before speaking he dragged a bent loaf from his pocket and threw<br>it up to me.<br><br>'MON AMI, MON CHER AMI, we're saved! What do you think?'<br><br>'Surely you haven't got a job!'<br><br>'At the Hotel X, near the Place de la Concorde--five hundred francs<br>a month, and food. I have been working there today. Name of Jesus Christ,<br>how I have eaten!'<br><br>After ten or twelve hours' work, and with his game leg, his first<br>thought had been to walk three kilometres to my hotel and tell me the good<br>news! What was more, he told me to meet him in the Tuileries the next day<br>during his afternoon interval, in case he should be able to steal some food<br>for me. At the appointed time I met Boris on a public bench. He undid his<br>waistcoat and produced a large, crushed, newspaper packet; in it were some<br>minced veal, a wedge of Gamembert cheese, bread and an eclair, all jumbled<br>together.<br><br>'VOILA!' said Boris, 'that's all I could smuggle out for you. The<br>doorkeeper is a cunning swine.'<br><br>It is disagreeable to eat out of a newspaper on a public seat,<br>especially in the Tuileries, which are generally full of pretty girls, but<br>I was too hungry to care. While I ate, Boris explained that he was working<br>in the cafeterie of the hotel--that is, in English, the stillroom. It<br>appeared that the cafeterie was the very lowest post in the hotel, and a<br>dreadful come-down for a waiter, but it would do until the Auberge de Jehan<br>Gottard opened. Meanwhile I was to meet Boris every day in the Tuileries,<br>and he would smuggle out as much food as he dared. For three days we<br>continued with this arrangement, and I lived entirely on the stolen food.<br>Then all our troubles came to an end, for one of the PLONGEURS left the<br>Hotel X, and on Boris's recommendation I was given a job there myself.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/7.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/9.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
