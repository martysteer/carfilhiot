<h2>Chapter I</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>The rue du Coq d'Or, Paris, seven in the morning. A succession of<br>furious, choking yells from the street. Madame Monce, who kept the little<br>hotel opposite mine, had come out on to the pavement to address a lodger on<br>the third floor. Her bare feet were stuck into sabots and her grey hair was<br>streaming down.<br><br>MADAME MONCE: 'SALOPE! SALOPE! How many times have I told you not to<br>squash bugs on the wallpaper? Do you think you've bought the hotel, eh? Why<br>can't you throw them out of the window like everyone else? PUTAIN! SALOPE!'<br><br>THE WOMAN ON THE THIRD FLOOR: 'VACHE!'<br><br>Thereupon a whole variegated chorus of yells, as windows were flung<br>open on every side and half the street joined in the quarrel. They shut up<br>abruptly ten minutes later, when a squadron of cavalry rode past and people<br>stopped shouting to look at them.<br><br>I sketch this scene, just to convey something of the spirit of the rue<br>du Coq d'Or. Not that quarrels were the only thing that happened there--<br>but still, we seldom got through the morning without at least one outburst<br>of this description. Quarrels, and the desolate cries of street hawkers,<br>and the shouts of children chasing orange-peel over the cobbles, and at<br>night loud singing and the sour reek of the refuse-carts, made up the<br>atmosphere of the street.<br><br>It was a very narrow street--a ravine of tall, leprous houses,<br>lurching towards one another in queer attitudes, as though they had all<br>been frozen in the act of collapse. All the houses were hotels and packed<br>to the tiles with lodgers, mostly Poles, Arabs and Italians. At the foot of<br>the hotels were tiny BISTROs, where you could be drunk for the equivalent<br>of a shilling. On Saturday nights about a third of the male population of<br>the quarter was drunk. There was fighting over women, and the Arab navvies<br>who lived in the cheapest hotels used to conduct mysterious feuds, and<br>fight them out with chairs and occasionally revolvers. At night the<br>policemen would only come through the street two together. It was a fairly<br>rackety place. And yet amid the noise and dirt lived the usual respectable<br>French shopkeepers, bakers and laundresses and the like, keeping themselves<br>to themselves and quietly piling up small fortunes. It was quite a<br>representative Paris slum.<br><br>My hotel was called the Hotel des Trois Moineaux. It was a dark,<br>rickety warren of five storeys, cut up by wooden partitions into forty<br>rooms. The rooms were small arid inveterately dirty, for there was no maid,<br>and Madame F., the PATRONNE, had no time to do any sweeping. The walls were<br>as thin as matchwood, and to hide the cracks they had been covered with<br>layer after layer of pink paper, which had come loose and housed<br>innumerable bugs. Near the ceiling long lines of bugs marched all day like<br>columns of soldiers, and at night came down ravenously hungry, so that one<br>had to get up every few hours and kill them in hecatombs. Sometimes when<br>the bugs got too bad one used to burn sulphur and drive them into the next<br>room; whereupon the lodger next door would retort by having his room<br>sulphured, and drive the bugs back. It was a dirty place, but homelike, for<br>Madame F. and her husband were good sorts. The rent of the rooms varied<br>between thirty and fifty francs a week.<br><br>The lodgers were a floating population, largely foreigners, who used<br>to turn up without luggage, stay a week and then disappear again. They were<br>of every trade--cobblers, bricklayers, stonemasons, navvies, students,<br>prostitutes, rag-pickers. Some of them were fantastically poor. In one of<br>the attics there was a Bulgarian student who made fancy shoes for the<br>American market. From six to twelve he sat on his bed, making a dozen pairs<br>of shoes and earning thirty-five francs; the rest of the day he attended<br>lectures at the Sorbonne. He was studying for the Church, and books of<br>theology lay face-down on his leather-strewn floor. In another room lived a<br>Russian woman and her son, who called himself an artist. The mother worked<br>sixteen hours a day, darning socks at twenty-five centimes a sock, while<br>the son, decently dressed, loafed in the Montparnasse cafes. One room was<br>let to two different lodgers, one a day worker and the other a night<br>worker. In another room a widower shared the same bed with his two grown-up<br>daughters, both consumptive.<br><br>There were eccentric characters in the hotel. The Paris slums are a<br>gathering-place for eccentric people--people who have fallen into<br>solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or<br>decent. Poverty frees them from ordinary standards of behaviour, just as<br>money frees people from work. Some of the lodgers in our hotel lived lives<br>that were curious beyond words.<br><br>There were the Rougiers, for instance, an old, ragged, dwarfish couple<br>who plied an extraordinary trade. They used to sell postcards on the<br>Boulevard St Michel. The curious thing was that the postcards were sold in<br>sealed packets as pornographic ones, but were actually photographs of<br>chateaux on the Loire; the buyers did not discover this till too late, and<br>of course never complained. The Rougiers earned about a hundred francs a<br>week, and by strict economy managed to be always half starved and half<br>drunk. The filth of their room was such that one could smell it on the<br>floor below. According to Madame F., neither of the Rougiers had taken off<br>their clothes for four years.<br><br>Or there was Henri, who worked in the sewers. He was a tall,<br>melancholy man with curly hair, rather romantic-looking in his long,<br>sewer-man's boots. Henri's peculiarity was that he did not speak, except<br>for the purposes of work, literally for days together. Only a year before<br>he had been a chauffeur in good employ and saving money. One day he fell in<br>love, and when the girl refused him he lost his temper and kicked her. On<br>being kicked the girl fell desperately in love with Henri, and for a<br>fortnight they lived together and spent a thousand francs of Henri's money.<br>Then the girl was unfaithful; Henri planted a knife in her upper arm and<br>was sent to prison for six months. As soon as she had been stabbed the girl<br>fell more in love with Henri than ever, and the two made up their quarrel<br>and agreed that when Henri came out of jail he should buy a taxi and they<br>would marry and settle down. But a fortnight later the girl was unfaithful<br>again, and when Henri came out she was with child, Henri did not stab her<br>again. He drew out all his savings and went on a drinking-bout that ended<br>in another month's imprisonment; after that he went to work in the sewers.<br>Nothing would induce Henri to talk. If you asked him why he worked in the<br>sewers he never answered, but simply crossed his wrists to signify<br>handcuffs, and jerked his head southward, towards the prison. Bad luck<br>seemed to have turned him half-witted in a single day.<br><br>Or there was R., an Englishman, who lived six months of the year in<br>Putney with his parents and six months in France. During his time in France<br>he drank four litres of wine a day, and six litres on Saturdays; he had<br>once travelled as far as the Azores, because the wine there is cheaper than<br>anywhere in Europe. He was a gentle, domesticated creature, never rowdy or<br>quarrelsome, and never sober. He would lie in bed till midday, and from<br>then till midnight he was in his comer of the BISTRO, quietly and<br>methodically soaking. While he soaked he talked, in a refined, womanish<br>voice, about antique furniture. Except myself, R. was the only Englishman<br>in the quarter.<br><br>There were plenty of other people who lived lives just as eccentric as<br>these: Monsieur Jules, the Roumanian, who had a glass eye and would not<br>admit it, Furex the Liniousin stonemason, Roucolle the miser--he died<br>before my time, though--old Laurent the rag-merchant, who used to copy<br>his signature from a slip of paper he carried in his pocket. It would be<br>fun to write some of their biographies, if one had time. I am trying to<br>describe the people in our quarter, not for the mere curiosity, but because<br>they are all part of the story. Poverty is what I am writing about, and I<br>had my first contact with poverty in this slum. The slum, with its dirt and<br>its queer lives, was first an object-lesson in poverty, and then the<br>background of my own experiences. It is for that reason that I try to give<br>some idea of what life was like there.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/1.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
