<h2>Chapter XXVII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>At about a quarter to six the Irishman led me to the spike. It was a<br>grim, smoky yellow cube of brick, standing in a corner of the workhouse<br>grounds. With its rows of tiny, barred windows, and a high wall and iron<br>gates separating it from the road, it looked much like a prison. Already a<br>long queue of ragged men had formed up, waiting for the gates to open. They<br>were of all kinds and ages, the youngest a fresh-faced boy of sixteen, the<br>oldest a doubled-up, toothless mummy of seventy-five. Some were hardened<br>tramps, recognizable by their sticks and billies and dust-darkened faces;<br>some were factory hands out of work, some agricultural labourers, one a<br>clerk in collar and tie, two certainly imbeciles. Seen in the mass,<br>lounging there, they were a disgusting sight; nothing villainous or<br>dangerous, but a graceless, mangy crew, nearly all ragged and palpably<br>underfed. They were friendly, however, and asked no questions. Many offered<br>me tobacco--cigarette ends, that is.<br><br>We leaned against the wall, smoking, and the tramps began to talk<br>about the spikes they had been in recently. It appeared from what they said<br>that all spikes are different, each with its peculiar merits and demerits,<br>and it is important to know these when you are on the road. An old hand<br>will tell you the peculiarities of every spike in England, as: at A you are<br>allowed to smoke but there are bugs in the cells; at B the beds are<br>comfortable but the porter is a bully; at C they let you out early in the<br>morning but the tea is undrinkable; at D the officials steal your money if<br>you have any--and so on interminably. There are regular beaten tracks<br>where the spikes are within a day's march of one another. I was told that<br>the Barnet-St Albans route is the best, and they warned me to steer clear<br>of Billericay and Chelmsford, also Ide Hill in Kent. Chelsea was said to be<br>the most luxurious spike in England; someone, praising it, said that the<br>blankets there were more like prison than the spike. Tramps go far afield<br>in summer, and in winter they circle as much as possible round the large<br>towns, where it is warmer and there is more charity. But they have to keep<br>moving, for you may not enter any one spike, or any two London spikes, more<br>than once in a month, on pain of being confined for a week.<br><br>Some time after six the gates opened and we began to file in one at a<br>time. In the yard was an office where an official entered in a ledger our<br>names and trades and ages, also the places we were coming from and going to<br>--this last is intended to keep a check on the movements of tramps. I gave<br>my trade as 'painter'; I had painted water-colours--who has not? The<br>official also asked us whether we had any money, and every man said no. It<br>is against the law to enter the spike with more than eightpence, and any<br>sum less than this one is supposed to hand over at the gate. But as a rule<br>the tramps prefer to smuggle their money in, tying it tight in a piece of<br>cloth so that it will not chink. Generally they put it in the bag of tea<br>and sugar that every tramp carries, or among their 'papers'. The 'papers'<br>are considered sacred and are never searched.<br><br>After registering at the office we were led into the spike by an<br>official known as the Tramp Major (his job is to supervise casuals, and he<br>is generally a workhouse pauper) and a great bawling ruffian of a porter in<br>a blue uniform, who treated us like cattle. The spike consisted simply of a<br>bathroom and lavatory, and, for the rest, long double rows of stone cells,<br>perhaps a hundred cells in all. It was a bare, gloomy place of stone and<br>whitewash, unwillingly clean, with a smell which, somehow, I had foreseen<br>from its appearance; a smell of soft soap, Jeyes' fluid and latrines--a<br>cold, discouraging, prisonish smell.<br><br>The porter herded us all into the passage, and then told us to come<br>into the bathroom six at a time, to be searched before bathing. The search<br>was for money and tobacco, Romton being one of those spikes where you can<br>smoke once you have smuggled your tobacco in, but it will be confiscated if<br>it is found on you. The old hands had told us that the porter never<br>searched below the knee, so before going in we had all hidden our tobacco<br>in the ankles of our boots. Afterwards, while undressing, we slipped it<br>into our coats, which we were allowed to keep, to serve as pillows.<br><br>The scene in the bathroom was extraordinarily repulsive. Fifty dirty,<br>stark-naked men elbowing each other in a room twenty feet square, with only<br>two bathtubs and two slimy roller towels between them all. I shall never<br>forget the reek of dirty feet. Less than half the tramps actually bathed (I<br>heard them saying that hot water is 'weakening' to the system), but they<br>all washed their faces and feet, and the horrid greasy little clouts known<br>as toe-rags which they bind round their toes. Fresh water was only allowed<br>for men who were having a complete bath, so many men had to bathe in water<br>where others had washed their feet. The porter shoved us to and fro, giving<br>the rough side of his tongue when anyone wasted time. When my turn came for<br>the bath, I asked if I might swill out the tub, which was streaked with<br>dirt, before using it. He answered simply, 'Shut yer--mouth and get on<br>with yer bath!' That set the social tone of the place, and I did not speak<br>again.<br><br>When we had finished bathing, the porter tied our clothes in bundles<br>and gave us workhouse shirts--grey cotton things of doubtful cleanliness,<br>like abbreviated nightgowns. We were sent along to the cells at once, and<br>presently the porter and the Tramp Major brought our supper across from the<br>workhouse. Each man's ration was a half-pound wedge of bread smeared with<br>margarine, and a pint of bitter sugarless cocoa in a tin billy. Sitting on<br>the floor we wolfed this in five minutes, and at about seven o'clock the<br>cell doors were locked on the outside, to remain locked till eight in the<br>morning.<br><br>Each man was allowed to sleep with his mate, the cells being intended<br>to hold two men apiece. I had no mate, and was put in with another solitary<br>man, a thin scrubby-faced fellow with a slight squint. The cell measured<br>eight feet by five by eight high, was made of stone, and had a tiny barred<br>window high up in the wall and a spyhole in the door, just like a cell in a<br>prison. In it were six blankets, a chamber-pot, a hot water pipe, and<br>nothing else whatever. I looked round the cell with a vague feeling that<br>there was something missing. Then, with a shock of surprise, I realized<br>what it was, and exclaimed:<br><br>'But I say, damn it, where are the beds?'<br><br>'BEDS?' said the other man, surprised. 'There aren't no beds! What yer<br>expect? This is one of them spikes where you sleeps on the floor. Christ!<br>Ain't you got used to that yet?'<br><br>It appeared that no beds was quite a normal condition in the spike. We<br>rolled up our coats and put them against the hot-water pipe, and made<br>ourselves as comfortable as we could. It grew foully stufiy, but it was not<br>warm enough to allow of our putting all the blankets underneath, so that we<br>could only use one to soften the floor. We lay a foot apart, breathing into<br>one another's face, with our naked limbs constantly touching, and rolling<br>against one another whenever we fell asleep. One fidgeted from side to<br>side, but it did not do much good; whichever way one turned there would be<br>first a dull numb feeling, then a sharp ache as the hardness of the floor<br>wore through the blanket. One could sleep, but not for more than ten<br>minutes on end.<br><br>About midnight the other man began making homosexual attempts upon me<br>--a nasty experience in a locked, pitch-dark cell. He was a feeble<br>creature and I could manage him easily, but of course it was impossible to<br>go to sleep again. For the rest of the night we stayed awake, smoking and<br>talking. The man told me the story of his life--he was a fitter, out of<br>work for three years. He said that his wife had promptly deserted him when<br>he lost his job, and he had been so long away from women that he had almost<br>forgotten what they were like. Homosexuality is general among tramps of<br>long standing, he said.<br><br>At eight the porter came along the passage unlocking the doors and<br>shouting 'All out!' The doors opened, letting out a stale, fetid stink. At<br>once the passage was full of squallid, grey-shirted figures, each<br>chamber-pot in hand, scrambling for the bathroom. It appeared that in the<br>morning only one tub of water was allowed for the lot of us, and when I<br>arrived twenty tramps had already washed their faces; I took one glance at<br>the black scum floating on the water, and went unwashed. After this we were<br>given a breakfast identical with the previous night's supper, our clothes<br>were returned to us, and we were ordered out into the yard to work. The<br>work was peeling potatoes for the pauper's dinner, but it was a mere<br>formality, to keep us occupied until the doctor came to inspect us. Most of<br>the tramps frankly idled. The doctor turned up at about ten o'clock and we<br>were told to go back to our cells, strip and wait in the passage for the<br>inspection.<br><br>Naked, and shivering, we lined up in the passage. You cannot conceive<br>what ruinous, degenerate curs we looked, standing there in the merciless<br>morning light. A tramp's clothes are bad, but they conceal far worse<br>things; to see him as he really is, unmitigated, you must see him naked.<br>Flat feet, pot bellies, hollow chests, sagging muscles--every kind of<br>physical rottenness was there. Nearly everyone was under-nourished, and<br>some clearly diseased; two men were wearing trusses, and as for the old<br>mummy-like creature of seventy-five, one wondered how he could possibly<br>make his daily march. Looking at our faces, unshaven and creased from the<br>sleepless night, you would have thought that all of us were recovering from<br>a week on the drink.<br><br>The inspection was designed merely to detect smallpox, and took no<br>notice of our general condition. A young medical student, smoking a<br>cigarette, walked rapidly along the line glancing us up and down, and not<br>inquiring whether any man was well or ill. When my cell companion stripped<br>I saw that his chest was covered with a red rash, and, having spent the<br>night a few inches away from him, I fell into a panic about smallpox. The<br>doctor, however, examined the rash and said that it was due merely to<br>under-nourishment.<br><br>After the inspection we dressed and were sent into the yard, where the<br>porter called our names over, gave us back any possessions we had left at<br>the office, and distributed meal tickets. These were worth sixpence each,<br>and were directed to coffee-shops on the route we had named the night<br>before. It was interesting to see that quite a number of the tramps could<br>not read, and had to apply to myself and other 'scholards' to decipher<br>their tickets.<br><br>The gates were opened, and we dispersed immediately. How sweet the air<br>does smell--even the air of a back street in the suburbs--after the<br>shut-in, subfaecal stench of the spike! I had a mate now, for while we were<br>peeling potatoes I had made friends with an Irish tramp named Paddy Jaques,<br>a melancholy pale man who seemed clean and decent. He was going to Edbury<br>spike, and suggested that we should go together. We set out, getting there<br>at three in the afternoon. It was a twelve-mile walk, but we made it<br>fourteen by getting lost among the desolate north London slums. Our meal<br>tickets were directed to a coffee-shop in Ilford. When we got there, the<br>little chit of a serving-maid, having seen our tickets and grasped that we<br>were tramps, tossed her head in contempt and for a long time would not<br>serve us. Finally she slapped on the table two 'large teas' and four slices<br>of bread and dripping--that is, eightpenny-worth of food. It appeared<br>that the shop habitually cheated the tramps of twopence or so on each<br>ticket; having tickets instead of money, the tramps could not protest or go<br>elsewhere.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/25.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/27.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
