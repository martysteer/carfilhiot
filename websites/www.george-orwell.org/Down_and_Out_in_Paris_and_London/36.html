<h2>Chapter XXXVII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>A word about the sleeping accommodation open to a homeless person in<br>London. At present it is impossible to get a BED in any non-charitable<br>institution in London for less than sevenpence a night. If you cannot<br>afford seven-pence for a bed, you must put up with one of the following<br>substitutes:<br><br>1. The Embankment. Here is the account that Paddy gave me of sleeping<br>on the Embankment:<br><br>'De whole t'ing wid de Embankment is gettin' to sleep early. You got<br>to be on your bench by eight o'clock, because dere ain't too many benches<br>and sometimes dey're all taken. And you got to try to get to sleep at once.<br>'Tis too cold to sleep much after twelve o'clock, an' de police turns you<br>off at four in de mornin'. It ain't easy to sleep, dough, wid dem bloody<br>trams flyin' past your head all de time, an' dem sky-signs across de river<br>flickin' on an' off in your eyes. De cold's cruel. Dem as sleeps dere<br>generally wraps demselves up in newspaper, but it don't do much good. You'd<br>be bloody lucky if you got t'ree hours' sleep.'<br><br>I have slept on the Embankment and found that it corresponded to<br>Paddy's description. It is, however, much better than not sleeping at all,<br>which is the alternative if you spend the night in the streets, elsewhere<br>than on the Embankment. According to the law in London, you may sit down<br>for the night, but the police must move you on if they see you asleep; the<br>Embankment and one or two odd corners (there is one behind the Lyceum<br>Theatre) are special exceptions. This law is evidently a piece of wilful<br>offensive-ness. Its object, so it is said, is to prevent people from dying<br>of exposure; but clearly if a man has no home and is going to die of<br>exposure, die he will, asleep or awake. In Paris there is no such law.<br>There, people sleep by the score under the Seine bridges, and in doorways,<br>and on benches in the squares, and round the ventilating shafts of the<br>Metro, and even inside the Metro stations. It does no apparent harm. No one<br>will spend a night in the street if he can possibly help it, and if he is<br>going to stay out of doors he might as well be allowed to sleep, if he can.<br><br>2. The Twopenny Hangover. This comes a little higher than the<br>Embankment. At the Twopenny Hangover, the lodgers sit in a row on a bench;<br>there is a rope in front of them, and they lean on this as though leaning<br>over a fence. A man, humorously called the valet, cuts the rope at five in<br>the morning. I have never been there myself, but Bozo had been there often.<br>I asked him whether anyone could possibly sleep in such an attitude, and he<br>said that it was more comfortable than it sounded--at any rate, better<br>than bare floor. There are similar shelters in Paris, but the charge there<br>is only twenty-five centimes (a halfpenny) instead of twopence.<br><br>3. The Coffin, at fourpence a night. At the Coffin you sleep in a<br>wooden box, with a tarpaulin for covering. It is cold, and the worst thing<br>about it are the bugs, which, being enclosed in a box, you cannot escape.<br><br>Above this come the common lodging-houses, with charges varying<br>between sevenpence and one and a penny a night. The best are the Rowton<br>Houses, where the charge is a shilling, for which you get a cubicle to<br>yourself, and the use of excellent bathrooms. You can also pay half a crown<br>for a 'special', which is practically hotel accommodation. The Rowton<br>Houses are splendid buildings, and the only objection to them is the strict<br>discipline, with rules against cooking, card-playing, etc. Perhaps the best<br>advertisement for the Rowton Houses is the fact that they are always full<br>to overflowing. The Bruce Houses, at one and a penny, are also excellent.<br><br>Next best, in point of cleanliness, are the Salvation Army hostels, at<br>sevenpence or eightpence. They vary (I have been in one or two that were<br>not very unlike common lodging-houses), but most of them are clean, and<br>they have good bathrooms; you have to pay extra for a bath, however. You<br>can get a cubicle for a shilling. In the eightpenny dormitories the beds<br>are comfortable, but there are so many of them (as a rule at least forty to<br>a room), and so close together, that it is impossible to get a quiet night.<br>The numerous restrictions stink of prison and charity. The Salvation Army<br>hostels would only appeal to people who put cleanliness before anything<br>else.<br><br>Beyond this there are the ordinary common lodging-houses. Whether you<br>pay sevenpence or a shilling, they are all stuffy and noisy, and the beds<br>are uniformly dirty and uncomfortable. What redeems them are their<br>LAISSEZ-FAIRE atmosphere and the warm home-like kitchens where one can<br>lounge at all hours of the day or night. They are squalid dens, but some<br>kind of social life is possible in them. The women's lodging-houses are<br>said to be generally worse than the men's, and there are very few houses<br>with accommodation for married couples. In fact, it is nothing out of the<br>common for a homeless man to sleep in one lodging-house and his wife in<br>another.<br><br>At this moment at least fifteen thousand people in London are living<br>in common lodging-houses. For an unattached man earning two pounds a week,<br>or less, a lodging-house is a great convenience. He could hardly get a<br>furnished room so cheaply, and the lodging-house gives him free firing, a<br>bathroom of sorts, and plenty of society. As for the dirt, it is a minor<br>evil. The really bad fault of lodging-houses is that they are places in<br>which one pays to sleep, and in which sound sleep is impossible. All one<br>gets for one's money is a bed measuring five feet six by two feet six, with<br>a hard convex mattress and a pillow like a block of wood, covered by one<br>cotton counterpane and two grey, stinking sheets. In winter there are<br>blankets, but never enough. And this bed is in a room where there are never<br>less than five, and sometimes fifty or sixty beds, a yard or two apart. Of<br>course, no one can sleep soundly in such circumstances. The only other<br>places where people are herded like this are barracks and hospitals. In the<br>public wards of a hospital no one even hopes to sleep well. In barracks the<br>soldiers are crowded, but they have good beds, and they are healthy; in a<br>common lodging-house nearly all the lodgers have chronic coughs, and a<br>large number have bladder diseases which make them get up at all the hours<br>of the night. The result is a perpetual racket, making sleep impossible. So<br>far as my observation goes, no one in a lodging-house sleeps more than five<br>hours a night--a damnable swindle when one has paid sevenpence or more.<br><br>Here legislation could accomplish something. At present there is all<br>manner of legislation by the L.C.C. about lodging-houses, but it is not<br>done in the interests of the lodgers. The L.C.C. only exert themselves to<br>forbid drinking, gambling, fighting, etc. etc. There is no law to say that<br>the beds in a lodging-house must be comfortable. This would be quite an<br>easy thing to enforce--much easier, for instance, than restrictions upon<br>gambling. The lodging-house keepers should be compelled to provide adequate<br>bedclothes and better mattresses, and above all to divide their dormitories<br>into cubicles. It does not matter how small a cubicle is, the important<br>thing is that a man should be alone when he sleeps. These few changes,<br>strictly enforced, would make an enormous difference. It is not impossible<br>to make a lodging-house reasonably comfortable at the usual rates of<br>payment. In the Groydon municipal lodging-house, where the charge is only<br>ninepence, there are cubicles, good beds, chairs (a very rare luxury in<br>lodging-houses), and kitchens above ground instead of in a cellar. There is<br>no reason why every ninepenny lodging-house should not come up to this<br>standard.<br><br>Of course, the owners of lodging-houses would be opposed EN BLOC to<br>any improvement, for their present business is an immensely profitable one.<br>The average house takes five or ten pounds a night, with no bad debts<br>(credit being strictly forbidden), and except for rent the expenses are<br>small. Any improvement would mean less crowding, and hence less profit.<br>Still, the excellent municipal lodging-house at Croydon shows how well one<br>CAN be served for ninepence. A few well-directed laws could make these<br>conditions general. If the authorities are going to concern themselves with<br>lodging-houses at all, they ought to start by making them more comfortable,<br>not by silly restrictions that would never be tolerated in a hotel.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/35.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/37.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
