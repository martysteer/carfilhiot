<h2>Chapter XIV</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>In a few days I had grasped the main principles on which the hotel was<br>run. The thing that would astonish anyone coming for the first time into<br>the service quarters of a hotel would be the fearful noise and disorder<br>during the rush hours. It is something so different from the steady work in<br>a shop or a factory that it looks at first sight like mere bad management.<br>But it is really quite unavoidable, and for this reason. Hotel work is not<br>particularly hard, but by its nature it comes in rushes and cannot be<br>economized. You cannot, for instance, grill a steak two hours before it is<br>wanted; you have to wait till the last moment, by which time a mass of<br>other work has accumulated, and then do it all together, in frantic haste.<br>The result is that at mealtimes everyone is doing two men's work, which is<br>impossible without noise and quarrelling. Indeed the quarrels are a<br>necessary part of the process, for the pace would never be kept up if<br>everyone did not accuse everyone else of idling. It was for this reason<br>that during the rush hours the whole staff raged and cursed like demons. At<br>those times there was scarcely a verb in the hotel except FOUTRE. A girl in<br>the bakery, aged sixteen, used oaths that would have defeated a cabman.<br>(Did not Hamlet say 'cursing like a scullion'? No doubt Shakespeare had<br>watched scullions at work.) But we are not losing our heads and wasting<br>time; we were just stimulating one another for the effort of packing four<br>hours' work into two hours.<br><br>What keeps a hotel going is the fact that the employees take a genuine<br>pride in their work, beastly and silly though it is. If a man idles, the<br>others soon find him out, and conspire against him to get him sacked.<br>Cooks, waiters and PLONGEURS differ greatly in outlook, but they are all<br>alike in being proud of their efficiency.<br><br>Undoubtedly the most workmanlike class, and the least servile, are the<br>cooks. They do not earn quite so much as waiters, but their prestige is<br>higher and their employment steadier. The cook does not look upon himself<br>as a servant, but as a skilled workman; he is generally called 'UN OUVRIER'<br>which a waiter never is. He knows his power--knows that he alone makes or<br>mars a restaurant, and that if he is five minutes late everything is out of<br>gear. He despises the whole non-cooking staff, and makes it a point of<br>honour to insult everyone below the head waiter. And he takes a genuine<br>artistic pride in his work, which demands very great skill. It is not the<br>cooking that is so difficult, but the doing everything to time. Between<br>breakfast and luncheon the head cook at the Hotel X would receive orders<br>for several hundred dishes, all to be served at different times; he cooked<br>few of them himself, but he gave instructions about all of them and<br>inspected them before they were sent up. His memory was wonderful. The<br>vouchers were pinned on a board, but the head cook seldom looked at them;<br>everything was stored in his mind, and exactly to the minute, as each dish<br>fell due, he would call out, 'FAITES MARCHER UNE COTELETTE DE VEAU' (or<br>whatever it was) unfailingly. He was an insufferable bully, but he was also<br>an artist. It is for their punctuality, and not for any superiority in<br>technique, that men cooks arc preferred to women.<br><br>The waiter's outlook is quite different. He too is proud in a way of<br>his skill, but his skill is chiefly in being servile. His work gives him<br>the mentality, not of a workman, but of a snob. He lives perpetually in<br>sight of rich people, stands at their tables, listens to their<br>conversation, sucks up to them with smiles and discreet little jokes. He<br>has the pleasure of spending money by proxy. Moreover, there is always the<br>chance that he may become rich himself, for, though most waiters die poor,<br>they have long runs of luck occasionally. At some cafes on the Grand<br>Boulevard there is so much money to be made that the waiters actually pay<br>the PATRON for their employment. The result is that between constantly<br>seeing money, and hoping to get it, the waiter comes to identify himself to<br>some extent with his employers. He will take pains to serve a meal in<br>style, because he feels that he is participating in the meal himself.<br><br>I remember Valenti telling me of some banquet at Nice at which he had<br>once served, and of how it cost two hundred thousand francs and was talked<br>of for months afterwards. 'It was splendid, MON P'TIT, MAIS MAGNIFIQUE!<br>Jesus Christ! The champagne, the silver, the orchids--I have never seen<br>anything like them, and I have seen some things. Ah, it was glorious!'<br><br>'But,' Isaid, 'you were only there to wait?'<br><br>'Oh, of course. But still, it was splendid.'<br><br>The moral is, never be sorry for a waiter. Sometimes when you sit in a<br>restaurant, still stuffing yourself half an hour after closing time, you<br>feel that the tired waiter at your side must surely be despising you. But<br>he is not. He is not thinking as he looks at you, 'What an overfed lout';<br>he is thinking, 'One day, when I have saved enough money, I shall be able<br>to imitate that man.' He is ministering to a kind of pleasure he thoroughly<br>understands and admires. And that is why waiters are seldom Socialists,<br>have no effective trade union, and will work twelve hours a day--they<br>work fifteen hours, seven days a week, in many cafes. They are snobs, and<br>they find the servile nature of their work rather congenial.<br><br>The PLONGEURS, again, have a different outlook. Theirs is a job which<br>offers no prospects, is intensely exhausting, and at the same time has not<br>a trace of skill or interest; the sort of job that would always be done by<br>women if women were strong enough. All that is required of them is to be<br>constantly on the run, and to put up with long hours and a stuffy<br>atmosphere. They have no way of escaping from this life, for they cannot<br>save a penny from their wages, and working from sixty to a hundred hours a<br>week leaves them no time to train for anything else. The best they can hope<br>for is to find a slightly softer job as night-watchman or lavatory<br>attendant.<br><br>And yet the PLONGEURS, low as they are, also have a kind of pride. It<br>is the pride of the drudge--the man who is equal to no matter what<br>quantity of work. At that level, the mere power to go on working like an ox<br>is about the only virtue attainable. DEBROUILLARD is what every PLONGEUR<br>wants to be called. A DEBROUILLARD is a man who, even when he is told to do<br>the impossible, will SE DEBROUILLER--get it done somehow. One of the<br>kitchen PLONGEURS at the Hotel X, a German, was well known as a<br>DEBROUILLARD. One night an English lord came to the hotel, and the waiters<br>were in despair, for the lord had asked for peaches, and there were none in<br>stock; it was late at night, and the shops would be shut. 'Leave it to me,'<br>said the German. He went out, and in ten minutes he was back with four<br>peaches. He had gone into a neighbouring restaurant and stolen them. That<br>is what is meant by a DEBROUILLARD. The English lord paid for the peaches<br>at twenty francs each.<br><br>Mario, who was in charge of the cafeterie, had the typical drudge<br>mentality. All he thought of was getting through the 'BOULOT', and he<br>defied you to give him too much of it. Fourteen years underground had left<br>him with about as much natural laziness as a piston rod. 'FAUT ETRE DUR,'<br>he used to say when anyone complained. You will often hear PLONGEURS boast,<br>'JE SUIS DUR'--as though they were soldiers, not male charwomen.<br><br>Thus everyone in the hotel had his sense of honour, and when the press<br>of work came we were all ready for a grand concerted effort to get through<br>it. The constant war between the different departments also made for<br>efficiency, for everyone clung to his own privileges and tried to stop the<br>others idling and pilfering.<br><br>This is the good side of hotel work. In a hotel a huge and complicated<br>machine is kept running by an inadequate staff, because every man has a<br>well-defined job and does it scrupulously. But there is a weak point, and<br>it is this--that the job the staff are doing is not necessarily what the<br>customer pays for. The customer pays, as he sees it, for good service; the<br>employee is paid, as he sees it, for the BOULOT--meaning, as a rule, an<br>imitation of good service. The result is that, though hotels are miracles<br>of punctuality, they are worse than the worst private houses in the things<br>that matter.<br><br>Take cleanliness, for example. The dirt in the Hotel X, as soon as one<br>penetrated into the service quarters, was revolting. Our cafeterie had<br>year-old filth in all the dark corners, and the bread-bin was infested with<br>cockroaches. Once I suggested killing these beasts to Mario. 'Why kill the<br>poor animals?' he said reproachfully. The others laughed when I wanted to<br>wash my hands before touching the butter. Yet we were clean where we<br>recognized cleanliness as part of the BOULOT. We scrubbed the tables and<br>polished the brasswork regularly, because we had orders to do that; but we<br>had no orders to be genuinely clean, and in any case we had no time for it.<br>We were simply carrying out our duties; and as our first duty was<br>punctuality, we saved time by being dirty.<br><br>In the kitchen the dirt was worse. It is not a figure of speech, it is<br>a mere statement of fact to say that a French cook will spit in the soup--<br>that is, if he is not going to drink it himself. He is an artist, but his<br>art is not cleanliness. To a certain extent he is even dirty because he is<br>an artist, for food, to look smart, needs dirty treatment. When a steak,<br>for instance, is brought up for the head cook's inspection, he does not<br>handle it with a fork. He picks it up in his fingers and slaps it down,<br>runs his thumb round the dish and licks it to taste the gravy, runs it<br>round and licks again, then steps back and contemplates the piece of meat<br>like an artist judging a picture, then presses it lovingly into place with<br>his fat, pink fingers, every one of which he has licked a hundred times<br>that morning. When he is satisfied, he takes a cloth and wipes his<br>fingerprints from the dish, and hands it to the waiter. And the waiter, of<br>course, dips HIS fingers into the gravy--his nasty, greasy fingers which<br>he is for ever running through his brilliantined hair. Whenever one pays<br>more than, say, ten francs for a dish of meat in Paris, one may be certain<br>that it has been fingered in this manner. In very cheap restaurants it is<br>different; there, the same trouble is not taken over the food, and it is<br>just forked out of the pan and flung on to a plate, without handling.<br>Roughly speaking, the more one pays for food, the more sweat and spittle<br>one is obliged to eat with it.<br><br>Dirtiness is inherent in hotels and restaurants, because sound food is<br>sacrificed to punctuality and smartness. The hotel employee is too busy<br>getting food ready to remember that it is meant to be eaten. A meal is<br>simply 'UNE COMMANDE' to him, just as a man dying of cancer is simply 'a<br>case' to the doctor. A customer orders, for example, a piece of toast.<br>Somebody, pressed with work in a cellar deep underground, has to prepare<br>it. How can he stop and say to himself, 'This toast is to be eaten--I<br>must make it eatable'? All he knows is that it must look right and must be<br>ready in three minutes. Some large drops of sweat fall from his forehead on<br>to the toast. Why should he worry? Presently the toast falls among the<br>filthy sawdust on the floor. Why trouble to make a new piece? It is much<br>quicker to wipe the sawdust off. On the way upstairs the toast falls again,<br>butter side down. Another wipe is all it needs. And so with everything. The<br>only food at the Hotel X which was ever prepared cleanly was the staff's,<br>and the PATRON'S. The maxim, repeated by everyone, was: 'Look out for the<br>PATRON, and as for the clients, S'EN F--PAS MAL!' Everywhere in the<br>service quarters dirt festered--a secret vein of dirt, running through<br>the great garish hotel like the intestines through a man's body.<br><br>Apart from the dirt, the PATRON swindled the customers wholeheartedly.<br>For the most part the materials of the food were very bad, though the cooks<br>knew how to serve it up in style. The meat was at best ordinary, and as to<br>the vegetables, no good housekeeper would have looked at them in the<br>market. The cream, by a standing order, was diluted with milk. The tea and<br>coffee were of inferior sorts, and the jam was synthetic stuff out of vast,<br>unlabelled tins. All the cheaper wines, according to Boris, were corked VIN<br>ORDINAIRE. There was a rule that employees must pay for anything they<br>spoiled, and in consequence damaged things were seldom thrown away. Once<br>the waiter on the third floor dropped a roast chicken down the shaft of our<br>service lift, where it fell into a litter of broken bread, torn paper and<br>so forth at the bottom. We simply wiped it with a cloth and sent it up<br>again. Upstairs there were dirty tales of once-used sheets not being<br>washed, but simply damped, ironed and put back on the beds. The PATRON was<br>as mean to us as to the customers. Throughout the vast hotel there was not,<br>for instance, such a thing as a brush and pan; one had to manage with a<br>broom and a piece of cardboard. And the staff lavatory was worthy of<br>Central Asia, and there was no place to wash one's hands, except the sinks<br>used for washing crockery.<br><br>In spite of all this the Hotel X was one of the dozen most expensive<br>hotels in Paris, and the customers paid startling prices. The ordinary<br>charge for a night's lodging, not including breakfast, was two hundred<br>francs. All wine and tobacco were sold at exactly double shop prices,<br>though of course the PATRON bought at the wholesale price. If a customer<br>had a title, or was reputed to be a millionaire, all his charges went up<br>automatically. One morning on the fourth floor an American who was on diet<br>wanted only salt and hot water for his breakfast. Valenti was furious.<br>'Jesus Christ!' he said, 'what about my ten per cent? Ten per cent of salt<br>and water!' And he charged twenty-five francs for the breakfast. The<br>customer paid without a murmur.<br><br>According to Boris, the same kind of thing went on in all Paris<br>hotels, or at least in all the big, expensive ones. But I imagine that the<br>customers at the Hotel X were especially easy to swindle, for they were<br>mostly Americans, with a sprinkling of English--no French--and seemed<br>to know nothing whatever about good food. They would stuff themselves with<br>disgusting American 'cereals', and eat marmalade at tea, and drink vermouth<br>after dinner, and order a POULET A LA REINE at a hundred francs and then<br>souse it in Worcester sauce. One customer, from Pittsburg, dined every<br>night in his bedroom on grape-nuts, scrambled eggs and cocoa.
