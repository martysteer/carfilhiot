<h2>Chapter XXII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>For what they are worth I want to give my opinions about the life of a<br>Paris PLONGEUR. When one comes to think of it, it is strange that thousands<br>of people in a great modem city should spend their waking hours swabbing<br>dishes in hot dens underground. The question I am raising is why this life<br>goes on--what purpose it serves, and who wants it to continue, and why I<br>am not taking the merely rebellious, FAINEANT attitude. I am trying to<br>consider the social significance of a PLONGEUR'S life.<br><br>I think one should start by saying that a PLONGEUR is one of the<br>slaves of the modem world. Not that there is any need to whine over him,<br>for he is better off than many manual workers, but still, he is no freer<br>than if he were bought and sold. His work is servile and without art; he is<br>paid just enough to keep him alive; his only holiday is the sack. He is cut<br>off from marriage, or, if he marries, his wife must work too. Except by a<br>lucky chance, he has no escape from this life, save into prison. At this<br>moment there are men with university degrees scrubbing dishes in Paris for<br>ten or fifteen hours a day. One cannot say that it is mere idleness on<br>their part, for an idle man cannot be a PLONGEUR; they have simply been<br>trapped by a routine which makes thought impossible. If PLONGEURS thought<br>at all, they would long ago have formed a union and gone on strike for<br>better treatment. But they do not think, because they have no leisure for<br>it; their life has made slaves of them.<br><br>The question is, why does this slavery continue? People have a way of<br>taking it for granted that all work is done for a sound purpose. They see<br>somebody else doing a disagreeable job, and think that they have solved<br>things by saying that the job is necessary. Coal-mining, for example, is<br>hard work, but it is necessary--we must have coal. Working in the sewers<br>is unpleasant, but somebody must work in the sewers. And similarly with a<br>PLONGEUR'S work. Some people must feed in restaurants, and so other people<br>must swab dishes for eighty hours a week. It is the work of civilization,<br>therefore unquestionable. This point is worth considering.<br><br>Is a PLONGEUR'S work really necessary to civilization? We have a<br>feeling that it must be 'honest' work, because it is hard and disagreeable,<br>and we have made a sort of fetish of manual work. We see a man cutting down<br>a tree, and we make sure that he is filling a social need, just because he<br>uses his muscles; it does not occur to us that he may only be cutting down<br>a beautiful tree to make room for a hideous statue. I believe it is the<br>same with a PLONGEUR. He earns his bread in the sweat of his brow, but it<br>does not follow that he is doing anything useful; he may be only supplying<br>a luxury which, very often, is not a luxury.<br><br>As an example of what I mean by luxuries which are not luxuries, take<br>an extreme case, such as one hardly sees in Europe. Take an Indian rickshaw<br>puller, or a gharry pony. In any Far Eastern town there are rickshaw<br>pullers by the hundred, black wretches weighing eight stone, clad in<br>loin-cloths. Some of them are diseased; some of them are fifty years old.<br>For miles on end they trot in the sun or rain, head down, dragging at the<br>shafts, with the sweat dripping from their grey moustaches. When they go<br>too slowly the passenger calls them BAHINCHUT. They earn thirty or forty<br>rupees a month, and cough their lungs out after a few years. The gharry<br>ponies are gaunt, vicious things that have been sold cheap as having a few<br>years' work left in them. Their master looks on the whip as a substitute<br>for food. Their work expresses itself in a sort of equation--whip plus<br>food equals energy; generally it is about sixty per cent whip and forty per<br>cent food. Sometimes their necks are encircled by one vast sore, so that<br>they drag all day on raw flesh. It is still possible to make them work,<br>however; it is just a question of thrashing them so hard that the pain<br>behind outweighs the pain in front. After a few years even the whip loses<br>its virtue, and the pony goes to the knacker. These are instances of<br>unnecessary work, for there is no real need for gharries and rickshaws;<br>they only exist because Orientals consider it vulgar to walk. They are<br>luxuries, and, as anyone who has ridden in them knows, very poor luxuries.<br>They afford a small amount of convenience, which cannot possibly balance<br>the suffering of the men and animals.<br><br>Similarly with the PLONGEUR. He is a king compared with a rickshaw<br>puller or a gharry pony, but his case is analogous. He is the slave of a<br>hotel or a restaurant, and his slavery is more or less useless. For, after<br>all, where is the REAL need of big hotels and smart restaurants? They are<br>supposed to provide luxury, but in reality they provide only a cheap,<br>shoddy imitation of it. Nearly everyone hates hotels. Some restaurants are<br>better than others, but it is impossible to get as good a meal in a<br>restaurant as one can get, for the same expense, in a private house. No<br>doubt hotels and restaurants must exist, but there is no need that they<br>should enslave hundreds of people. What makes the work in them is not the<br>essentials; it is the shams that are supposed to represent luxury.<br>Smartness, as it is called, means, in effect, merely that the staff work<br>more and the customers pay more; no one benefits except the proprietor, who<br>will presently buy himself a striped villa at Deauville. Essentially, a<br>'smart' hotel is a place where a hundred people toil like devils in order<br>that two hundred may pay through the nose for things they do not really<br>want. If the nonsense were cut out of hotels and restaurants, and the work<br>done with simple efficiency, PLONGEURS might work six or eight hours a day<br>instead often or fifteen.<br><br>Suppose it is granted that a PLONGEUR'S work is more or less useless.<br>Then the question follows, Why does anyone want him to go on working? I am<br>trying to go beyond the immediate economic cause, and to consider what<br>pleasure it can give anyone to think of men swabbing dishes for life. For<br>there is no doubt that people--comfortably situated people--do find a<br>pleasure in such thoughts. A slave, Marcus Gato said, should be working<br>when he is not sleeping. It does not matter whether his work is needed or<br>not, he must work, because work in itself is good--for slaves, at least.<br>This sentiment still survives, and it has piled up mountains of useless<br>drudgery.<br><br>I believe that this instinct to perpetuate useless work is, at bottom,<br>simply fear of the mob. The mob (the thought runs) are such low animals<br>that they would be dangerous if they had leisure; it is safer to keep them<br>too busy to think. A rich man who happens to be intellectually honest, if<br>he is questioned about the improvement of working conditions, usually says<br>something like this:<br><br>'We know that poverty is unpleasant; in fact, since it is so remote,<br>we rather enjoy harrowing ourselves with the thought of its unpleasantness.<br>But don't expect us to do anything about it. We are sorry for you lower<br>classes, just as we are sorry for a, cat with the mange, but we will fight<br>like devils against any improvement of your condition. We feel that you are<br>much safer as you are. The present state of affairs suits us, and we are<br>not going to take the risk of setting you free, even by an extra hour a<br>day. So, dear brothers, since evidently you must sweat to pay for our trips<br>to Italy, sweat and be damned to you.'<br><br>This is particularly the attitude of intelligent, cultivated people;<br>one can read the substance of it in a hundred essays. Very few cultivated<br>people have less than (say) four hundred pounds a year, and naturally they<br>side with the rich, because they imagine that any liberty conceded to the<br>poor is a threat to their own liberty. Foreseeing some dismal Marxian<br>Utopia as the alternative, the educated man prefers to keep things as they<br>are. Possibly he does not like his fellow-rich very much, but he supposes<br>that even the vulgarest of them are less inimical to his pleasures, more<br>his kind of people, than the poor, and that he had better stand by them. It<br>is this fear of a supposedly dangerous mob that makes nearly all<br>intelligent people conservative in their opinions.<br><br>Fear of the mob is a superstitious fear. It is based on the idea that<br>there is some mysterious, fundamental difference between rich and poor, as<br>though they were two different races, like Negroes and white men. But in<br>reality there is no such difference. The mass of the rich and the poor are<br>differentiated by their incomes and nothing else, and the. average<br>millionaire is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit. Change<br>places, and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Everyone<br>who has mixed on equal terms with the poor knows this quite well. But the<br>trouble is that intelligent, cultivated people, the very people who might<br>be expected to have liberal opinions, never do mix with the poor. For what<br>do the majority of educated people know about poverty? In my copy of<br>Villon's poems the editor has actually thought it necessary to explain the<br>line 'NE PAIN NE VOYENT QU'AUX FENESTRES' by a footnote; so remote is even<br>hunger from the educated man's experience.<br><br>From this ignorance a superstitious fear of the mob results quite<br>naturally. The educated man pictures a horde of submen, wanting only a<br>day's liberty to loot his house, burn his books, and set him to work<br>minding a machine or sweeping out a lavatory. 'Anything,' he thinks, 'any<br>injustice, sooner than let that mob loose.' He does not see that since<br>there is no difference between the mass of rich and poor, there is no<br>question of setting the mob loose. The mob is in fact loose now, and--in<br>the shape of rich men--is using its power to set up enormous treadmills<br>of boredom, such as 'smart' hotels.<br><br>To sum up. A PLONGEUR is a slave, and a wasted slave, doing stupid and<br>largely unnecessary work. He is kept at work, ultimately, because of a<br>vague feeling that he would be dangerous if he had leisure. And educated<br>people, who should be on his side, acquiesce in the process, because they<br>know nothing about him and consequently are afraid of him. I say this of<br>the PLONGEUR because it is his case I have been considering; it would apply<br>equally to numberless other types of worker. These are only my own ideas<br>about the basic facts of a PLONGEUR'S life, made without reference to<br>immediate economic questions, and no doubt largely platitudes. I present<br>them as a sample of the thoughts that are put into one's head by working in<br>an hotel.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/20.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/22.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
