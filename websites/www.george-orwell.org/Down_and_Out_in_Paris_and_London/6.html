<h2>Chapter VII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>My money oozed away--to eight francs, to four francs, to one franc,<br>to twenty-five centimes; and twenty-five centimes is useless, for it will<br>buy nothing except a newspaper. We went several days on dry bread, and then<br>I was two and a half days with nothing to eat whatever. This was an ugly<br>experience. There are people who do fasting cures of three weeks or more,<br>and they say that fasting is quite pleasant after the fourth day; I do not<br>know, never having gone beyond the third day. Probably it seems different<br>when one is doing it voluntarily and is not underfed at the start.<br><br>The first day, too inert to look for work, I borrowed a rod and went<br>fishing in the Seine, baiting with bluebottles. I hoped to catch enough for<br>a meal, but of course I did not. The Seine is full of dace, but they grew<br>cunning during the siege of Paris, and none of them has been caught since,<br>except in nets. On the second day I thought of pawning my overcoat, but it<br>seemed too far to walk to the pawnshop, and I spent the day in bed, reading<br>the MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES. It was all that I felt equal to, without<br>food. Hunger reduces one to an utterly spineless, brainless condition, more<br>like the after-effects of influenza than anything else. It is as though one<br>had been turned into a jellyfish, or as though all one's blood had been<br>pumped out and luke-wann water substituted. Complete inertia is my chief<br>memory of hunger; that, and being obliged to spit very frequently, and the<br>spittle being curiously white and flocculent, like cuckoo-spit. I do not<br>know the reason for this, but everyone who has gone hungry several days has<br>noticed it.<br><br>On the third morning I felt very much better. I realized that I must<br>do something at once, and I decided to go and ask Boris to let me share his<br>two francs, at any rate for a day or two. When I arrived I found Boris in<br>bed, and furiously angry. As soon as I came in he burst out, almost<br>choking:<br><br>'He has taken it back, the dirty thief! He has taken it back!'<br><br>'Who's taken what?' I said.<br><br>'The Jew! Taken my two francs, the dog, the thief! He robbed me in my<br>sleep!'<br><br>It appeared that on the previous night the Jew had flatly refused to<br>pay the daily two francs. They had argued and argued, and at last the Jew<br>had consented to hand over the money; he had done it, Boris said, in the<br>most offensive manner, making a little speech about how kind he was, and<br>extorting abject gratitude. And then in the morning he had stolen the money<br>back before Boris was awake.<br><br>This was a blow. I was horribly disappointed, for I had allowed my<br>belly to expect food, a great mistake when one is hungry. However, rather<br>to my surprise, Boris was far from despairing. He sat up in bed, lighted<br>his pipe and reviewed the situation.<br><br>'Now listen, MON AMI, this is a tight comer. We have only twenty-five<br>centimes between us, and I don't suppose the Jew will ever pay my two<br>francs again. In any case his behaviour is becoming intolerable. Will you<br>believe it, the other night he had the indecency to bring a woman in here,<br>while I was there on the floor. The low animal! And I have a worse thing to<br>tell you. The Jew intends clearing out of here. He owes a week's rent, and<br>his idea is to avoid paying that and give me the slip at the same time. If<br>the Jew shoots the moon I shall be left without a roof, and the PATRON will<br>take my suitcase in lieu of rent, curse him! We have got to make a vigorous<br>move.'<br><br>'All right. But what can we do? It seems to me that the only thing is<br>to pawn our overcoats and get some food.'<br><br>'We'll do that, of course, but I must get my possessions out of this<br>house first. To think of my photographs being seized! Well, my plan is<br>ready. I'm going to forestall the Jew and shoot the moon myself. F----<br>LE CAMP--retreat, you understand. I think that is the correct move, eh?'<br><br>'But, my dear Boris, how can you, in daytime? You're bound to be<br>caught.'<br><br>'Ah well, it will need strategy, of course. Our PATRON is on the watch<br>for people slipping out without paying their rent; he's been had that way<br>before. He and his wife take it in turns all day to sit in the office--<br>what misers, these Frenchmen! But I have thought of a way to do it, if you<br>will help.'<br><br>I did not feel in a very helpful mood, but I asked Boris what his plan<br>was. He explained it carefully.<br><br>'Now listen. We must start by pawning our overcoats. First go back to<br>your room and fetch your overcoat, then come back here and fetch mine, and<br>smuggle it out under cover of yours. Take them to the pawnshop in the rue<br>des Francs Bourgeois. You ought to get twenty francs for the two, with<br>luck. Then go down to the Seine bank and fill your pockets with stones, and<br>bring them back and put them in my suitcase. You see the idea? I shall wrap<br>as many of my things as I can carry in a newspaper, and go down and ask the<br>PATRON the way to the nearest laundry. I shall be very brazen and casual,<br>you understand, and of course the PATRON will think the bundle is nothing<br>but dirty linen. Or, if he does suspect anything, he will do what he always<br>does, the mean sneak; he will go up to my room and feel the weight of my<br>suitcase. And when he feels the weight of stones he will think it is still<br>full. Strategy, eh? Then afterwards I can come back and carry my other<br>things out in my pockets.'<br><br>'But what about the suitcase?'<br><br>'Oh, that? We shall have to abandon it. The miserable thing only cost<br>about twenty francs. Besides, one always abandons something in a retreat.<br>Look at Napoleon at the Beresina! He abandoned his whole army.'<br><br>Boris was so pleased with this scheme (he called it UNE RUSE DE GUERRE)<br>that he almost forgot being hungry. Its main weakness--that he would have<br>nowhere to sleep after shooting the moon--he ignored.<br><br>At first the RUSE DE GUERRE worked well. I went home and fetched my<br>overcoat (that made already nine kilometres, on an empty belly) and<br>smuggled Boris's coat out successfully. Then a hitch occurred. The receiver<br>at the pawnshop, a nasty, sour-faced, interfering, little man--a typical<br>French official--refused the coats on the ground that they were not<br>wrapped up in anything. He said that they must be put either in a valise or<br>a cardboard box. This spoiled everything, for we had no box of any kind,<br>and with only twenty-five centimes between us we could not buy one.<br><br>I went back and told Boris the bad news. 'MERDE!' he said, 'that makes<br>it awkward. Well, no matter, there is always a way. We'll put the overcoats<br>in my suitcase.'<br><br>'But how are we to get the suitcase past the PATRON? He's sitting<br>almost in the door of the office. It's impossible!'<br><br>'How easily you despair, MON AMI! Where is that English obstinacy that<br>I have read of? Courage! We'll manage it.'<br><br>Boris thought for a little while, and then produced another cunning<br>plan. The essential difficulty was to hold the PATRON's attention for<br>perhaps five seconds, while we could slip past with the suitcase. But, as<br>it happened, the PATRON had just one weak spot--that he was interested in<br>LE SPORT, and was ready to talk if you approached him on this subject.<br>Boris read an article about bicycle races in an old copy of the PETIT<br>PARISIEN, and then, when he had reconnoitred the stairs, went down and<br>managed to set the PATRON talking. Meanwhile, I waited at the foot of the<br>stairs, with the overcoats under one arm and the suitcase under the other.<br>Boris was to give a cough when he thought the moment favourable. I waited<br>trembling, for at any moment the PATRON'S wife might come out of the door<br>opposite the office, and then the game was up. However, presently Boris<br>coughed. I sneaked rapidly past the office and out into the street,<br>rejoicing that my shoes did not creak. The plan might have failed if Boris<br>had been thinner, for his big shoulders blocked the doorway of the office.<br>His nerve was splendid, too; he went on laughing and talking in the most<br>casual way, and so loud that he quite covered any noise I made. When I was<br>well away he came and joined me round the corner, and we bolted.<br><br>And then, after all our trouble, the receiver at the pawnshop again<br>refused the overcoats. He told me (one could see his French soul revelling<br>in the pedantry of it) that I had not sufficient papers of identification;<br>my CARTE D'IDENTITE was not enough, and I must show a passport or addressed<br>envelopes. Boris had addressed envelopes by the score, but his CARTE<br>D'IDENTITE was out of order (he never renewed it, so as to avoid the tax),<br>so we could not pawn the overcoats in his name. All we could do was to<br>trudge up to my room, get the necessary papers, and take the coats to the<br>pawnshop in the Boulevard Port Royal.<br><br>I left Boris at my room and went down to the pawnshop. When I got<br>there I found that it was shut and would not open till four in the<br>afternoon. It was now about half-past one, and I had walked twelve<br>kilometres and had no food for sixty hours. Fate seemed to be playing a<br>series of extraordinarily unamusing jokes.<br><br>Then the luck changed as though by a miracle. I was walking home<br>through the Rue Broca when suddenly, glittering on the cobbles, I saw a<br>five-sou piece. I pounced on it, hurried home, got our other five-sou piece<br>and bought a pound of potatoes. There was only enough alcohol in the stove<br>to parboil them, and we had no salt, but we wolfed them, skins and all.<br>After that we felt like new men, and sat playing chess till the pawnshop<br>opened.<br><br>At four o'clock I went back to the pawnshop. I was not hopeful, for if<br>I had only got seventy francs before, what could I expect for two shabby<br>overcoats in a cardboard suitcase? Boris had said twenty francs, but I<br>thought it would be ten francs, or even five. Worse yet, I might be refused<br>altogether, like poor NUMERO 83 on the previous occasion. I sat on the<br>front bench, so as not to see people laughing when the clerk said five<br>francs.<br><br>At last the clerk called my number: 'NUMERO 117!'<br><br>'Yes,' I said, standing up.<br><br>'Fifty francs?'<br><br>It was almost as great a shock as the seventy francs had been the time<br>before. I believe now that the clerk had mixed my number up with someone<br>else's, for one could not have sold the coats outright for fifty francs. I<br>hurried home and walked into my room with my hands behind my back, saying<br>nothing. Boris was playing with the chessboard. He looked up eagerly.<br><br>'What did you get?' he exclaimed. 'What, not twenty francs? Surely you<br>got ten francs, anyway? NOM DE DIEU, five francs--that is a bit too<br>thick. MON AMI, DON'T say it was five francs. If you say it was five francs<br>I shall really begin to think of suicide.'<br><br>I threw the fifty-franc, note on to the table. Boris turned white as<br>chalk, and then, springing up, seized my hand and gave it a grip that<br>almost broke the bones. We ran out, bought bread and wine, a piece of meat<br>and alcohol for the stove, and gorged.<br><br>After eating, Boris became more optimistic than I had ever known him.<br>'What did I tell you?' he said. 'The fortune of war! This morning with five<br>sous, and now look at us. I have always said it, there is nothing easier to<br>get than money. And that reminds me, I have a friend in the rue Fondary<br>whom we might go and see. He has cheated me of four thousand francs, the<br>thief. He is the greatest thief alive when he is sober, but it is a curious<br>thing, he is quite honest when he is drunk. I should think he would be<br>drunk by six in the evening. Let's go and find him. Very likely he will pay<br>up a hundred on account. MERDE! He might pay two hundred. ALLONS-Y!'<br><br>We went to the rue Fondary and found the man, and he was drunk, but we<br>did not get our hundred francs. As soon as he and Boris met there was a<br>terrible altercation on the pavement. The other man declared that he did<br>not owe Boris a penny, but that on the contrary Boris owed HIM four<br>thousand francs, and both of them kept appealing to me for my opinion. I<br>never understood the rights of the matter. The two argued and argued, first<br>in the street, then in a BISTRO, then in a PRIX FIXE restaurant where we<br>went for dinner, then in another BISTRO. Finally, having called one another<br>thieves for two hours, they went off together on a drinking bout that<br>finished up the last sou of Boris's money.<br><br>Boris slept the night at the house of a cobbler, another Russian<br>refugee, in the Commerce quarter. Meanwhile, I had eight francs left, and<br>plenty of cigarettes, and was stuffed to the eyes with food and drink. It<br>was a marvellous change for the better after two bad days.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/5.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/7.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
