<h2>Chapter V</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>A short time before, Boris had given me an address in the rue du<br>Marche des Blancs Manteaux. All he had said in his letter was that 'things<br>were not marching too badly', and I assumed that he was back at the Hotel<br>Scribe, touching his hundred francs a day. I was full of hope, and wondered<br>why I had been fool enough not to go to Boris before. I saw myself in a<br>cosy restaurant, with jolly cooks singing love-songs as they broke eggs<br>into the pan, and five solid meals a day. I even squandered two francs<br>fifty on a packet of Gaulois Bleu, in anticipation of my wages.<br><br>In the morning I walked down to the rue du Marche des Blancs Manteaux;<br>with a shock, I found it a shimmy back street-as bad as my own. Boris's<br>hotel was the dirtiest hotel in the street. From its dark doorway there<br>came out a vile, sour odour, a mixture of slops and synthetic soup--it<br>was Bouillon Zip, twenty-five centimes a packet. A misgiving came over me.<br>People who drink Bouillon Zip are starving, or near it. Could Boris<br>possibly be earning a hundred francs a day? A surly PATRON, sitting in the<br>office, said to me. Yes, the Russian was at home--in the attic. I went up<br>six nights of narrow, winding stairs, the Bouillon Zip growing stronger as<br>one got higher. Boris did not answer when I knocked at his door, so I<br>opened it and went in.<br><br>The room was an attic, ten feet square, lighted only by a skylight,<br>its sole furniture a narrow iron bedstead, a chair, and a washhand-stand<br>with one game leg. A long S-shaped chain of bugs marched slowly across the<br>wall above the bed. Boris was lying asleep, naked, his large belly making a<br>mound under the grimy sheet. His chest was spotted with insect bites. As I<br>came in he woke up, rubbed his eyes, and groaned deeply.<br><br>'Name of Jesus Christ!' he exclaimed, 'oh, name of Jesus Christ, my<br>back! Curse it, I believe my back is broken!'<br><br>'What's the matter?' I exclaimed.<br><br>'My back is broken, that is all. I have spent the night on the floor.<br>Oh, name of Jesus Christ! If you knew what my back feels like!'<br><br>'My dear Boris, are you ill?'<br><br>'Not ill, only starving--yes, starving to death if this goes on much<br>longer. Besides sleeping on the floor, I have lived on two francs a day for<br>weeks past. It is fearful. You have come at a bad moment, MON AMI.'<br><br>It did not seem much use to ask whether Boris still had his job at the<br>Hotel Scribe. I hurried downstairs and bought a loaf of bread. Boris threw<br>himself on the bread and ate half of it, after which he felt better, sat up<br>in bed, and told me what was the matter with him. He had failed to get a<br>job after leaving the hospital, because he was still very lame, and he had<br>spent all his money and pawned everything, and finally starved for several<br>days. He had slept a week on the quay under the Font d'Austerlitz, among<br>some empty wine barrels. For the past fortnight he had been living in this<br>room, together with a Jew, a mechanic. It appeared (there was some<br>complicated explanation.) that the Jew owed Boris three hundred francs, and<br>was repaying this by letting him sleep on the floor and allowing him two<br>francs a day for food. Two francs would buy a bowl of coffee and three<br>rolls. The Jew went to work at seven in the mornings, and after that Boris<br>would leave his sleeping-place (it was beneath the skylight, which let in<br>the rain) and get into the bed. He could not sleep much even there owing to<br>the bugs, but it rested his back after the floor.<br><br>It was a great disappointment, when I had come to Boris for help, to<br>find him even worse off than myself. I explained that I had only about<br>sixty francs left and must get a job immediately. By this time, however,<br>Boris had eaten the rest of the bread and was feeling cheerful and<br>talkative. He said carelessly:<br><br>'Good heavens, what are you worrying about? Sixty francs--why, it's<br>a fortune! Please hand me that shoe, MON AMI. I'm going to smash some of<br>those bugs if they come within reach.'<br><br>'But do you think there's any chance of getting a job?'<br><br>'Chance? It's a certainty. In fact, I have got something already.<br>There is a new Russian restaurant which is to open in a few days in the rue<br>du Commerce. It is UNE CHOSE ENTENDUE that I am to be MAITRE D'HOTEL. I can<br>easily get you a job in the kitchen. Five hundred francs a month and your<br>food--tips, too, if you are lucky.'<br><br>'But in the meantime? I've got to pay my rent before long.'<br><br>'Oh, we shall find something. I have got a few cards-up my sleeve.<br>There are people who owe me money, for instance--Paris is full of them.<br>One of them is bound to pay up before long. Then think of all the women who<br>have been my mistress! A woman never forgets, you know--I have only to<br>ask and they will help me. Besides, the Jew tells me he is going to steal<br>some magnetos from the garage where he works, and he will pay us five<br>francs a day to clean them before he sells them. That alone would keep us.<br>Never worry, MON AMI. Nothing is easier to get than money.'<br><br>'Well, let's go out now and look for a job.'<br><br>'Presently, MON AMI. We shan't starve, don't you fear. This is only<br>the fortune of war--I've been in a worse hole scores of times. It's only<br>a question of persisting. Remember Foch's maxim: "ATTAQUEZ! ATTAQUEZ!<br>ATTAQUEZ!"'<br><br>It was midday before Boris decided to get up. All the clothes he now<br>had left were one suit, with one shirt, collar and tie, a pair of shoes<br>almost worn out, and a pair of socks all holes. He had also an overcoat<br>which was to be pawned in the last extremity. He had a suitcase, a wretched<br>twenty-franc cardboard thing, but very important, because the PATRON of the<br>hotel believed that it was full of clothes--without that, he would<br>probably have turned Boris out of doors. What it actually contained were<br>the medals and photographs, various odds and ends, and huge bundles of<br>love-letters. In spite of all this Boris managed to keep a fairly smart<br>appearance. He shaved without soap and with a razor-blade two months old,<br>tied his tie so that the holes did not show, and carefully stuffed the<br>soles of his shoes with newspaper. Finally, when he was dressed, he<br>produced an ink-bottle and inked the skin of his ankles where it showed<br>through his socks. You would never have thought, when it was finished, that<br>he had recently been sleeping under the Seine bridges.<br><br>We went to a small cafe off the rue de Rivoli, a well-known rendezvous<br>of hotel managers and employees. At the back was a dark, cave-like room<br>where all kinds of hotel workers were sitting--smart young waiters,<br>others not so smart and clearly hungry, fat pink cooks, greasy<br>dish-washers, battered old scrubbing-women. Everyone had an untouched glass<br>of black coffee in front of him. The place was, in effect, an employment<br>bureau, and the money spent on drinks was the PATRON'S commission.<br>Sometimes a stout, important-looking man, obviously a restaurateur, would<br>come in and speak to the barman, and the barmanwould call to one of the<br>people at the back of the cafe. But he never called to Boris or me, and we<br>left after two hours, as the etiquette was that you could only stay two<br>hours for one drink. We learned afterwards, when it was too late, that the<br>dodge was to bribe the barman; if you could afford twenty francs he would<br>generally get you a job.<br><br>We went to the Hotel Scribe and waited an hour on the pavement, hoping<br>that the manager would come out, but he never did. Then we dragged<br>ourselves down to the rue du Commerce, only to find that the new<br>restaurant, which was being redecorated, was shut up and the PATRON away.<br>It was now night. We had walked fourteen kilometres over pavement, and we<br>were so tired that we had to waste one franc fifty on going home by Metro.<br>Walking was agony to Boris with his game leg, and his optimism wore thinner<br>and thinner as the day went on. When he got out of the Metro at the Place<br>d'Italie he was in despair. He began to say that it was no use looking for<br>work--there was nothing for it but to try crime.<br><br>'Sooner rob than starve, MON AMI. I have often planned it. A fat, rich<br>American--some dark corner down Montparnasse way--a cobblestone in a<br>stocking--bang! And then go through his pockets and bolt. It is feasible,<br>do you not think? I would not flinch--I have been a soldier, remember.'<br><br>He decided against the plan in the end, because we were both<br>foreigners and easily recognized.<br><br>When we had got back to my room we spent another one franc fifty on<br>bread and chocolate. Boris devoured his share, and at once cheered up like<br>magic; food seemed to act on his system as rapidly as a cocktail. He took<br>out a pencil and began making a list of the people who would probably give<br>us jobs. There were dozens of them, he said.<br><br>'Tomorrow we shall find something, MON AMI, I know it in my bones. The<br>luck always changes. Besides, we both have brains--a man with brains<br>can't starve.<br><br>'What things a man can do with brains! Brains will make money out of<br>anything. I had a friend once, a Pole, a real man of genius; and what do<br>you think he used to do? He would buy a gold ring and pawn it for fifteen<br>francs. Then--you know how carelessly the clerks fill up the tickets--<br>where the clerk had written "EN OR" he would add "ET DIAMANTS" and he would<br>change "fifteen francs" to "fifteen thousand". Neat, eh? Then, you see, he<br>could borrow a thousand francs on the security of the ticket. That is what<br>I mean by brains...'<br><br>For the rest of the evening Boris was in a hopeful mood, talking of<br>the times we should have together when we were waiters together at Nice or<br>Biarritz, with smart rooms and enough money to set up mistresses. He was<br>too tired to walk the three kilometres back to his hotel, and slept the<br>night on the floor of my room, with his coat rolled round his shoes for a<br>pillow.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/3.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/5.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
