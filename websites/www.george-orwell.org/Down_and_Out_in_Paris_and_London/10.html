<h2>Chapter XI</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>As it turned out, I did not break my contract, for it was six weeks<br>before the Auberge de Jehan Cottard even showed signs of opening. In the<br>meantime I worked at the Hotel X, four days a week in the cafeterie, one<br>day helping the waiter on the fourth floor, and one day replacing the woman<br>who washed up for the dining-room. My day off, luckily, was Sunday, but<br>sometimes another man was ill and I had to work that day as well. The hours<br>were from seven in the morning till two in the afternoon, and from five in<br>the evening till nine--eleven hours; but it was a fourteen-hour day when<br>I washed up for the dining-room. By the ordinary standards of a Paris<br>PLONGEUR, these are exceptionally short hours. The only hardship of life<br>was the fearful heat and stuffiness of these labyrinthine cellars. Apart<br>from this the hotel, which was large and well organized, was considered a<br>comfortable one.<br><br>Our cafeterie was a murky cellar measuring twenty feet by seven by<br>eight high, and so crowded with coffee-urns, breadcutters and the like that<br>one could hardly move without banging against something. It was lighted by<br>one dim electric bulb, and four or five gas-fires that sent out a fierce<br>red breath. There was a thermometer there, and the temperature never fell<br>below 110 degrees Fahrenheit--it neared 130 at some times of the day. At<br>one end were five service lifts, and at the other an ice cupboard where we<br>stored milk and butter. When you went into the ice cupboard you dropped a<br>hundred degrees of temperature at a single step; it used to remind me of<br>the hymn about Greenland's icy mountains and India's coral strand. Two men<br>worked in the cafeterie besides Boris and myself. One was Mario, a huge,<br>excitable Italian--he was like a city policeman with operatic gestures--<br>and the other, a hairy, uncouth animal whom we called the Magyar; I think<br>he was a Transylvanian, or something even more remote. Except the Magyar we<br>were all big men, and at the rush hours we collided incessantly.<br><br>The work in the cafeterie was spasmodic. We were never idle, but the<br>real work only came in bursts of two hours at a time--we called each<br>burst 'UN COUP DE FEU'. The first COUP DE FEU came at eight, when the<br>guests upstairs began to wake up and demand breakfast. At eight a sudden<br>banging and yelling would break out all through the basement; bells rang on<br>all sides, blue-aproned men rushed through the passages, our service lifts<br>came down with a simultaneous crash, and the waiters on all five floors<br>began shouting Italian oaths down the shafts. I don't remember all our<br>duties, but they included making tea, coffee and chocolate, fetching meals<br>from the kitchen, wines from the cellar and fruit and so forth from the<br>dining-room, slicing bread, making toast, rolling pats of butter, measuring<br>jam, opening milk-cans, counting lumps of sugar, boiling eggs, cooking<br>porridge, pounding ice, grinding coffee--all this for from a hundred to<br>two hundred customers. The kitchen was thirty yards away, and the<br>dining-room sixty or seventy yards. Everything we sent up in the service<br>lifts had to be covered by a voucher, and the vouchers had to be carefully<br>filed, and there was trouble if even a lump of sugar was lost. Besides<br>this, we had to supply the staff with bread and coffee, and fetch the meals<br>for the waiters upstairs. All in all, it was a complicated job.<br><br>I calculated that one had to walk and run about fifteen miles during<br>the day, and yet the strain of the work was more mental than physical.<br>Nothing could be easier, on the face of it, than this stupid scullion work,<br>but it is astonishingly hard when one is in a hurry. One has to leap to and<br>fro between a multitude of jobs--it is like sorting a pack of cards<br>against the clock. You are, for example, making toast, when bang! down<br>comes a service lift with an order for tea, rolls and three different kinds<br>of jam, and simultaneously bang! down comes another demanding scrambled<br>eggs, coffee and grapefruit; you run to the kitchen for the eggs and to the<br>dining-room for the fruit, going like lightning so as to be back before<br>your toast bums, and having to remember about the tea and coffee, besides<br>half a dozen other orders that are still pending; and at the same time some<br>waiter is following you and making trouble about a lost bottle of<br>soda-water, and you are arguing with him. It needs more brains than one<br>might think. Mario said, no doubt truly, that it took a year to make a<br>reliable cafetier.<br><br>The time between eight and half past ten was a sort of delirium.<br>Sometimes we were going as though we had only five minutes to live;<br>sometimes there were sudden lulls when the orders stopped and everything<br>seemed quiet for a moment. Then we swept up the litter from the floor,<br>threw down fresh sawdust, and swallowed gallipots of wine or coffee or<br>water--anything, so long as it was wet. Very often we used to break off<br>chunks of ice and suck them while we worked. The heat among the gas-fires<br>was nauseating; we swallowed quarts of drink during the day, and after a<br>few hours even our aprons were drenched with sweat. At times we were<br>hopelessly behind with the work, and some of the customers would have gone<br>without their breakfast, but Mario always pulled us through. He had worked<br>fourteen years in the cafeterie, and he had the skill that never wastes a<br>second between jobs. The Magyar was very stupid and I was inexperienced,<br>and Boris was inclined to shirk, partly because of his lame leg, partly<br>because he was ashamed of working in the cafeterie after being a waiter;<br>but Mario was wonderful. The way he would stretch his great arms right<br>across the cafeterie to fill a coffee-pot with one hand and boil an egg<br>with the other, at the same time watching toast and shouting directions to<br>the Magyar, and between whiles singing snatches from RIGOLETTO, was beyond<br>all praise. The PATRON knew his value, and he was paid a thousand francs a<br>month, instead of five hundred like the rest of us.<br><br>The breakfast pandemonium stopped at half past ten. Then we scrubbed<br>the cafeterie tables, swept the floor and polished the brasswork, and, on<br>good mornings, went one at a time to the lavatory for a smoke. This was our<br>slack time--only relatively slack, however, for we had only ten minutes<br>for lunch, and we never got through it uninterrupted. The customers'<br>luncheon hour, between twelve and two, was another period of turmoil like<br>the breakfast hour. Most of our work was fetching meals from the kitchen,<br>which meant constant ENGUEULADES from the cooks. By this time the cooks had<br>sweated in front of their furnaces for four or five hours, and their<br>tempers were all warmed up.<br><br>At two we were suddenly free men. We threw off our aprons and put on<br>our coats, hurried out of doors, and, when we had money, dived into the<br>nearest BISTRO. It was strange, coming up into the street from those<br>firelit cellars. The air seemed blindingly clear and cold, like arctic<br>summer; and how sweet the petrol did smell, after the stenches of sweat and<br>food! Sometimes we met some of our cooks and waiters in the BISTROS, and<br>they were friendly and stood us drinks. Indoors we were their slaves, but<br>it is an etiquette in hotel life that between hours everyone is equal, and<br>the ENGUEULADES do not count.<br><br>At a quarter to five we went back to the hotel. Till half-past six<br>there were no orders, and we used this time to polish silver, clean out the<br>coffee-urns, and do other odd jobs. Then the grand turmoil of the day<br>started--the dinner hour. I wish I could be Zola for a little while, just<br>to describe that dinner hour. The essence of the situation was that a<br>hundred or two hundred people were demanding individually different meals<br>of five or six courses, and that fifty or sixty people had to cook and<br>serve them and clean up the mess afterwards; anyone with experience of<br>catering will know what that means. And at this time when the work was<br>doubled, the whole staff was tired out, and a number of them were drunk. I<br>could write pages about the scene without giving a true idea of it. The<br>chargings to and fro in the narrow passages, the collisions, the yells, the<br>struggling with crates and trays and blocks of ice, the heat, the darkness,<br>the furious festering quarrels which there was no time to fight out--they<br>pass description. Anyone coming into the basement for the first time would<br>have thought himself in a den of maniacs. It was only later, when I<br>understood the working of a hotel, that I saw order in all this chaos.<br><br>At half past eight the work stopped very suddenly. We were not free<br>till nine, but we used to throw ourselves full length on the floor, and lie<br>there resting our legs, too lazy even to go to the ice cupboard for a<br>drink. Sometimes the CHEF DU PERSONNEL would come in with bottles of beer,<br>for the hotel stood us an extra beer when we had had a hard day. The food<br>we were given was no more than eatable, but the PATRON was not mean about<br>drink; he allowed us two litres of wine a day each, knowing that if a<br>PLONGEUR is not given two litres he will steal three. We had the heeltaps<br>of bottles as well, so that we often drank too much--a good thing, for<br>one seemed to work faster when partially drunk.<br><br>Four days of the week passed like this; of the other two working days,<br>one was better and one worse. After a week of this life I felt in need of a<br>holiday. It was Saturday night, so the people in our BISTRO were busy<br>getting drunk, and with a free day ahead of me I was ready to join them. We<br>all went to bed, drunk, at two in the morning, meaning to sleep till noon.<br>At half past five I was suddenly awakened. A night-watchman, sent from the<br>hotel, was standing at my bedside. He stripped the clothes back and shook<br>me roughly.<br><br>'Get up!' he said. 'TU T'ES BIEN SAOULE LA GNEULE, EH? Well, never<br>mind that, the hotel's a man short. You've got to work today.'<br><br>'Why should I work?' I protested. 'This is my day off.'<br><br>'Day off, nothing! The work's got to be done. Get up!'<br><br>I got up and went out, feeling as though my back were broken and my<br>skull filled with hot cinders. I did not think that I could possibly do a<br>day's work. And yet, after only an hour in the basement, I found that I was<br>perfectly well. It seemed that in the heat of those cellars, as in a<br>turkish bath, one could sweat out almost any quantity of drink. PLONGEURS<br>know this, and count on it. The power of swallowing quarts of wine, and<br>then sweating it out before it can do much damage, is one of the<br>compensations of their life.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/9.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/11.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
