<h2>Chapter XXXI</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>The charge at Bozo's lodging-house was ninepence a night. It was a<br>large, crowded place, with accommodation for five hundred men, and a<br>well-known rendezvous of tramps, beggars, and petty criminals. All races,<br>even black and white, mixed in it on terms of equality. There were Indians<br>there, and when I spoke to one of them in bad Urdu he addressed me as<br>'turn'--a thing to make one shudder, if it had been in India. We had got<br>below the range of colour prejudice. One had glimpses of curious lives. Old<br>'Grandpa', a tramp of seventy who made his living, or a great part of it,<br>by collecting cigarette ends and selling the tobacco at threepence an<br>ounce. 'The Doctor'--he was a real doctor, who had been struck off the<br>register for some offence, and besides selling newspapers gave medical<br>advice at a few pence a time. A little Chittagonian lascar, barefoot and<br>starving, who had deserted his ship and wandered for days through London,<br>so vague and helpless that he did not even know the name of the city he was<br>in--he thought it was Liverpool, until I told him. A begging-letter<br>writer, a friend of Bozo's, who wrote pathetic appeals for aid to pay for<br>his wife's funeral, and, when a letter had taken effect, blew himself out<br>with huge solitary gorges of bread and margarine. He was a nasty,<br>hyena-like creature. I talked to him and found that, like most swindlers,<br>he believed a great part of his own lies. The lodging-house was an Alsatia<br>for types like these.<br><br>While I was with Bozo he taught me something about the technique of<br>London begging. There is more in it than one might suppose. Beggars vary<br>greatly, and there is a sharp social line between those who merely cadge<br>and those who attempt to give some value for money. The amounts that one<br>can earn by the different 'gags' also vary. The stories in the Sunday<br>papers about beggars who die with two thousand pounds sewn into their<br>trousers are, of course, lies; but the better-class beggars do have runs of<br>luck, when they earn a living wage for weeks at a time. The most prosperous<br>beggars are street acrobats and street photographers. On a good pitch--a<br>theatre queue, for instance--a street acrobat will often earn five pounds<br>a week. Street photographers can earn about the same, but they are<br>dependent on fine weather. They have a cunning dodge to stimulate trade.<br>When they see a likely victim approaching one of them runs behind the<br>camera and pretends to take a photograph. Then as the victim reaches them,<br>they exclaim:<br><br>'There y'are, sir, took yer photo lovely. That'll be a bob.'<br><br>'But I never asked you to take it,' protests the victim.<br><br>'What, you didn't want it took? Why, we thought you signalled with<br>your 'and. Well, there's a plate wasted! That's cost us sixpence, that<br>'as.'<br><br>At this the victim usually takes pity and says he will have the photo<br>after all. The photographers examine the plate and say that it is spoiled,<br>and that they will take a fresh one free of charge. Of course, they have<br>not really taken the first photo; and so, if the victim refuses, they waste<br>nothing.<br><br>Organ-grinders, like acrobats, are considered artists rather than<br>beggars. An organ-grinder named Shorty, a friend of Bozo's, told me all<br>about his trade. He and his mate 'worked' the coffee-shops and<br>public-houses round Whitechapel and the Commercial Road. It is a mistake to<br>think that organ-grinders earn their living in the street; nine-tenths of<br>their money is taken in coffee-shops and pubs--only the cheap pubs, for<br>they are not allowed into the good-class ones. Shorty's procedure was to<br>stop outside a pub and play one tune, after which his mate, who had a<br>wooden leg and could excite compassion, went in and passed round the hat.<br>It was a point of honour with Shorty always to play another tune after<br>receiving the 'drop'--an encore, as it were; the idea being that he was a<br>genuine entertainer and not merely paid to go away. He and his mate took<br>two or three pounds a week between them, but, as they had to pay fifteen<br>shillings a week for the hire of the organ, they only averaged a pound a<br>week each. They were on the streets from eight in the morning till ten at<br>night, and later on Saturdays.<br><br>Screevers can sometimes be called artists, sometimes not. Bozo<br>introduced me to one who was a 'real' artist--that is, he had studied art<br>in Paris and submitted pictures to the Salon in his day. His line was<br>copies of Old Masters, which he did marvellously, considering that he was<br>drawing on stone. He told me how he began as a screever:<br><br>'My wife and kids Were starving. I was walking home late at night,<br>with a lot of drawings I'd been taking round the dealers, and wondering how<br>the devil to raise a bob or two. Then, in the Strand, I saw a fellow<br>kneeling on the pavement drawing, and people giving him pennies. As I came<br>past he got up and went into a pub. "Damn it," I thought, "if he can make<br>money at that, so can I." So on the impulse I knelt down and began drawing<br>with his chalks. Heaven knows how I came to do it; I must have been<br>lightheaded with hunger. The curious thing was that I'd never used pastels<br>before; I had to leam the technique as I went along. Well, people began to<br>stop and say that my drawing wasn't bad, arid they gave me ninepence<br>between them. At this moment the other fellow came out of the pub. "What in<br>--are you doing on my pitch?" he said. I explained that I was hungry and<br>had to earn something. "Oh," said he, "come and have a pint with me." So I<br>had a pint, and since that day I've been a screever. I make a pound a week.<br>You can't keep six kids on a pound a week, but luckily my wife earns a bit<br>taking in sewing.<br><br>'The worst thing in this life is the cold, and the next worst is the<br>interference you have to put up with. At first, not knowing any better, I<br>used sometimes to copy a nude on the pavement. The first I did was outside<br>St Martin's-in-the-Fields church. A fellow in black--I suppose he was a<br>churchwarden or something--came out in a tearing rage. "Do you think we<br>can have that obscenity outside God's holy house?" he cried. So I had to<br>wash it out. It was a copy of Botticelli's Venus. Another time I copied the<br>same picture on the Embankment. A policeman passing looked at it, and then,<br>without a word, walked on to it and rubbed it out with his great flat<br>feet.'<br><br>Bozo told the same tale of police interference. At the time when I was<br>with him there had been a case of 'immoral conduct' in Hyde Park, in which<br>the police had behaved rather badly. Bozo produced a cartoon of Hyde Park<br>with policemen concealed in the trees, and the legend, 'Puzzle, find the<br>policemen.' I pointed out to him how much more telling it would be to put,<br>'Puzzle, find the immoral conduct,' but Bozo would not hear of it. He said<br>that any policeman who saw it would move him on, and he would lose his<br>pitch for good.<br><br>Below screevers come the people who sing hymns, or sell matches, or<br>bootlaces, or envelopes containing a few grains of lavender--called,<br>euphemistically, perfume. All these people are frankly beggars, exploiting<br>an appearance of misery, and none of them takes on an average more than<br>half a crown a day. The reason why they have to pretend to sell matches and<br>so forth instead of begging outright is that this is demanded by the absurd<br>English laws about begging. As the law now stands, if you approach a<br>stranger and ask him for twopence, he can call a policeman and get you<br>seven days for begging. But if you make the air hideous by droning 'Nearer,<br>my God, to Thee,' or scrawl some chalk daubs on the pavement, or stand<br>about with a tray of matches--in short, if you make a nuisance of<br>yourself--you are held to be following a legitimate trade and not<br>begging. Match-selling and street-singing are simply legalized crimes. Not<br>profitable crimes, however; there is not a singer or match-seller in London<br>who can be sure of 50 pounds a year--a poor return for standing eighty-four<br>hours a week on the kerb, with the cars grazing your backside.<br><br>It is worth saying something about the social position of beggars, for<br>when one has consorted with them, and found that they are ordinary human<br>beings, one cannot help being struck by the curious attitude that society<br>takes towards them. People seem to feel that there is some essential<br>difference between beggars and ordinary 'working' men. They are a race<br>apart--outcasts, like criminals and prostitutes. Working men 'work',<br>beggars do not 'work'; they are parasites, worthless in their very nature.<br>It is taken for granted that a beggar does not 'earn' his living, as a<br>bricklayer or a literary critic 'earns' his. He is a mere social<br>excrescence, tolerated because we live in a humane age, but essentially<br>despicable.<br><br>Yet if one looks closely one sees that there is no ESSENTIAL<br>difference between a beggar's livelihood and that of numberless respectable<br>people. Beggars do not work, it is said; but, then, what is WORK? A navvy<br>works by swinging a pick. An accountant works by adding up figures. A<br>beggar works by standing out of doors in all weathers and getting varicose<br>veins, chronic bronchitis, etc. It is a trade like any other; quite<br>useless, of course--but, then, many reputable trades are quite useless.<br>And as a social type a beggar compares well with scores of others. He is<br>honest compared with the sellers of most patent medicines, high-minded<br>compared with a Sunday newspaper proprietor, amiable compared with a<br>hire-purchase tout--in short, a parasite, but a fairly harmless parasite.<br>He seldom extracts more than a bare living from the community, and, what<br>should justify him according to our ethical ideas, he pays for it over and<br>over in suffering. I do not think there is anything about a beggar that<br>sets him in a different class from other people, or gives most modern men<br>the right to despise him.<br><br>Then the question arises, Why are beggars despised?--for they are<br>despised, universally. I believe it is for the simple reason that they fail<br>to earn a decent living. In practice nobody cares whether work is useful or<br>useless, productive or parasitic; the sole thing demanded is that it shall<br>be profitable. In all the modem talk about energy, efficiency, social<br>service and the rest of it, what meaning is there except 'Get money, get it<br>legally, and get a lot of it'? Money has become the grand test of virtue.<br>By this test beggars fail, and for this they are despised. If one could<br>earn even ten pounds a week at begging, it would become a respectable<br>profession immediately. A beggar, looked at realistically, is simply a<br>businessman, getting his living, like other businessmen, in the way that<br>comes to hand. He has not, more than most modem people, sold his honour; he<br>has merely made the mistake of choosing a trade at which it is impossible<br>to grow rich.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/29.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/31.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
