<h2>Chapter XXIV</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>I travelled to England third class via Dunkirk and Tilbury, which is<br>the cheapest and not the worst way of crossing the Channel. You had to pay<br>extra for a cabin, so I slept in the saloon, together with most of the<br>third-class passengers. I find this entry in my diary for that day:<br><br>'Sleeping in the saloon, twenty-seven men, sixteen women. Of the<br>women, not a single one has washed her face this morning. The men mostly<br>went to the bathroom; the women merely produced vanity cases and covered<br>the dirt with powder. Q. A secondary sexual difference?'<br><br>On the journey I fell in with a couple of Roumanians, mere children,<br>who were going to England on their honeymoon trip. They asked innumerable<br>questions about England, and I told them some startling lies. I was so<br>pleased to be getting home, after being hard up for months in a foreign<br>city, that England seemed to me a sort of Paradise. There are, indeed, many<br>things in England that make you glad to get home; bathrooms, armchairs,<br>mint sauce, new potatoes properly cooked, brown bread, marmalade, beer made<br>with veritable hops--they are all splendid, if you can pay for them.<br>England is a very good country when you are not poor; and, of course, with<br>a tame imbecile to look after, I was not going to be poor. The thought of<br>not being poor made me very patriotic. The more questions the Roumanians<br>asked, the more I praised England; the climate, the scenery, the art, the<br>literature, the laws--everything in England was perfect.<br><br>Was the architecture in England good? the Roumanians asked.<br>'Splendid!' I said. 'And you should just see the London statues! Paris is<br>vulgar--half grandiosity and half slums. But London--'<br><br>Then the boat drew alongside Tilbury pier. The first building we saw<br>on the waterside was one of those huge hotels, all stucco and pinnacles,<br>which stare from the English coast like idiots staring over an asylum wall.<br>I saw the Roumanians, too polite to say anything, cocking their eyes at the<br>hotel. 'Built by French architects,' I assured them; and even later, when<br>the train was crawling into London through the eastern slums, I still kept<br>it up about the beauties of English architecture. Nothing seemed too good<br>to say about England, now that I was coming home and was not hard up any<br>more.<br><br>I went to B.'s office, and his first words knocked everything to<br>ruins. 'I'm sorry,' he said; 'your employers have gone abroad, patient and<br>all. However, they'll be back in a month. I suppose you can hang on till<br>then?'<br><br>I was outside in the street before it even occurred to me to borrow<br>some more money. There was a month to wait, and I had exactly nineteen and<br>sixpence in hand. The news had taken my breath away. For a long time I<br>could not make up my mind what to do. I loafed the day in the streets, and<br>at night, not having the slightest notion of how to get a cheap bed in<br>London, I went to a 'family' hotel, where the charge was seven and<br>sixpence. After paying the bill I had ten and twopence in hand.<br><br>By the morning I had made my plans. Sooner or later I should have to<br>go to B. for more money, but it seemed hardly decent to do so yet, and in<br>the meantime I must exist in some hole-and-corner way. Past experience set<br>me against pawning my best suit. I would leave all my things at the station<br>cloakroom, except my second-best suit, which I could exchange for some<br>cheap clothes and perhaps a pound. If I was going to live a month on thirty<br>shillings I must have bad clothes--indeed, the worse the better. Whether<br>thirty shillings could be made to last a month I had no idea, not knowing<br>London as I knew Paris. Perhaps I could beg, or sell bootlaces, and I<br>remembered articles I had read in the Sunday papers about beggars who have<br>two thousand pounds sewn into their trousers. It was, at any rate,<br>notoriously impossible to starve in London, so there was nothing to be<br>anxious about.<br><br>To sell my clothes I went down into Lambeth, where the people are poor<br>and there are a lot of rag shops. At the first shop I tried the proprietor<br>was polite but unhelpful; at the second he was rude; at the third he was<br>stone deaf, or pretended to be so. The fourth shopman was a large blond<br>young man, very pink all over, like a slice of ham. He looked at the<br>clothes I was wearing and felt them disparagingly between thumb and finger.<br><br>'Poor stuff,' he said, 'very poor stuff, that is.' (It was quite a<br>good suit.) 'What yer want for 'em?'<br><br>I explained that I wanted some older clothes and as much money as he<br>could spare. He thought for a moment, then collected some dirty-looking<br>rags and threw them on to the counter. 'What about the money?' I said,<br>hoping for a pound. He pursed Us lips, then produced A SHILLING and laid it<br>beside the clothes. I did not argue--I was going to argue, but as I<br>opened my mouth he reached out as though to take up the shilling again; I<br>saw that I was helpless. He let me change in a small room behind the shop.<br><br>The clothes were a coat, once dark brown, a pair of black dungaree<br>trousers, a scarf and a cloth cap; I had kept my own shirt, socks and<br>boots, and I had a comb and razor in my pocket. It gives one a very strange<br>feeling to be wearing such clothes. I had worn bad enough things before,<br>but nothing at all like these; they were not merely dirty and shapeless,<br>they had--how is one to express it?--a gracelessness, a patina of<br>antique filth, quite different from mere shabbiness. They were the sort of<br>clothes you see on a bootlace seller, or a tramp. An hour later, in<br>Lambeth, I saw a hang-dog man, obviously a tramp, coming towards me, and<br>when I looked again it was myself, reflected in a shop window. The dirt was<br>plastering my face already. Dirt is a great respecter of persons; it lets<br>you alone when you are well dressed, but as soon as your collar is gone it<br>flies towards you from all directions.<br><br>I stayed in the streets till late at night, keeping on the move all<br>the time. Dressed as I was, I was half afraid that the police might arrest<br>me as a vagabond, and I dared not speak to anyone, imagining that they must<br>notice a disparity between my accent and my clothes. (Later I discovered<br>that this never happened.) My new clothes had put me instantly into a new<br>world. Everyone's demeanour seemed to have changed abruptly. I helped a<br>hawker pick up a barrow that he had upset. 'Thanks, mate,' he said with a<br>grin. No one had called me mate before in my life--it was the clothes<br>that had done it. For the first time I noticed, too, how the attitude of<br>women varies with a man's clothes. When a badly dressed man passes them<br>they shudder away from him with a quite frank movement of disgust, as<br>though he were a dead cat. Clothes are powerful things. Dressed in a<br>tramp's clothes it is very difficult, at any rate for the first day, not to<br>feel that you are genuinely degraded. You might feel the same shame,<br>irrational but very real, your first night in prison.<br><br>At about eleven I began looking for a bed. I had read about<br>doss-houses (they are never called doss-houses, by the way), and I supposed<br>that one could get a bed for fourpence or thereabouts. Seeing a man, a<br>navvy or something of the kind, standing on the kerb in the Waterloo Road,<br>I stopped and questioned him. I said that I was stony broke and wanted the<br>cheapest bed I could get.<br><br>'Oh,' said he, 'you go to that 'ouse across the street there, with the<br>sign "Good Beds for Single Men". That's a good kip [sleeping place], that<br>is. I bin there myself on and off. You'll find it cheap AND clean.'<br><br>It was a tall, battered-looking house, with dim lights in all the<br>windows, some of which were patched with brown paper. I entered a stone<br>passage-way, and a little etiolated boy with sleepy eyes appeared from a<br>door leading to a cellar. Murmurous sounds came from the cellar, and a wave<br>of hot air and cheese. The boy yawned and held out his hand.<br><br>'Want a kip? That'll be a 'og, guv'nor.'<br><br>I paid the shilling, and the boy led me up a rickety unlighted<br>staircase to a bedroom. It had a sweetish reek of paregoric and foul linen;<br>the windows seemed to be tight shut, and the air was almost suffocating at<br>first. There was a candle burning, and I saw that the room measured fifteen<br>feet square by eight high, and had eight beds in it. Already six lodgers<br>were in bed, queer lumpy shapes with all their own clothes, even their<br>boots, piled on top of them. Someone was coughing in a loathsome manner in<br>one corner.<br><br>When I got into the bed I found that it was as hard as a board, and as<br>for the pillow, it was a mere hard cylinder like a block of wood. It was<br>rather worse than sleeping on a table, because the bed was not six feet<br>long, and very narrow, and the mattress was convex, so that one had to hold<br>on to avoid falling out. The sheets stank so horribly of sweat that I could<br>not bear them near my nose. Also, the bedclothes only consisted of the<br>sheets and a cotton counterpane, so that though stuffy it was none too<br>warm. Several noises recurred throughout the night. About once in an hour<br>the man on my left--a sailor, I think--woke up, swore vilely, and<br>lighted a cigarette. Another man, victim of a bladder disease, got up and<br>noisily used his chamber-pot half a dozen times during the night. The man<br>in the corner had a coughing fit once in every twenty minutes, so regularly<br>that one came to listen for it as one listens for the next yap when a dog<br>is baying the moon. It was an unspeakably repellent sound; a foul bubbling<br>and retching, as though the man's bowels were being churned up within him.<br>Once when he struck a match I saw that he was a very old man, with a grey,<br>sunken face like that of a corpse, and he was wearing his trousers wrapped<br>round his head as a nightcap, a thing which for some reason disgusted me<br>very much. Every time he coughed or the other man swore, a sleepy voice<br>from one of the other beds cried out:<br><br>'Shut up! Oh, for Christ's--SAKE shut up!'<br><br>I had about an hour's sleep in all. In the morning I was woken by a dim<br>impression of some large brown thing coming towards me. I opened my eyes<br>and saw that it was one of the sailor's feet, sticking out of bed close<br>to my face. It was dark brown, quite dark brown like an Indian's,<br>with dirt. The walls were leprous, and the sheets, three weeks from<br>the wash, were almost raw umber colour. I got up, dressed and went<br>downstairs. In the cellar were a row of basins and two slippery<br>roller towels. I had a piece of soap in my pocket, and I was going<br>to wash, when I noticed that every basin was streaked with grime--solid,<br>sticky filth as black as boot-blacking. I went out unwashed. Altogether,<br>the lodging-house had not come up to its description as cheap and clean. It<br>was however, as I found later, a fairly representative lodging-house.<br><br>I crossed the river and walked a long way eastward, finally going into<br>a coffee-shop on Tower Hill. An ordinary London coffee-shop, like a<br>thousand others, it seemed queer. and foreign after Paris. It was a little<br>stuffy room with the high-backed pews that were fashionable in the<br>'forties, the day's menu written on a mirror with a piece of soap, and a<br>girl of fourteen handling the dishes. Navvies were eating out of newspaper<br>parcels, and drinking tea in vast saucerless mugs like china tumblers. In a<br>corner by himself a Jew, muzzle down in the plate, was guiltily wolfing<br>bacon.<br><br>'Could I have some tea and bread and butter?' I said to the girl.<br><br>She stared. 'No butter, only marg,' she said, surprised. And she<br>repeated the order in the phrase that is to London what the eternal COUP DE<br>ROUGE is to Paris: 'Large tea and two slices!'<br><br>On the wall beside my pew there was a notice saying 'Pocketing the<br>sugar not allowed,' and beneath it some poetic customer had written:<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He that takes away the sugar,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be called a dirty----<br><br><br>but someone else had been at pains to scratch out the last word. This was<br>England. The tea-and-two-slices cost threepence halfpenny, leaving me with<br>eight and twopence.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/22.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/24.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
