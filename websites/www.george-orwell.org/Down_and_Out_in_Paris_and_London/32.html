<h2>Chapter XXXIII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>The two pounds that B. had given me lasted about ten days. That it<br>lasted so long was due to Paddy, who had learned parsimony on the road and<br>considered even one sound meal a day a wild extravagance. Food, to him, had<br>come to mean simply bread and margarine--the eternal tea-and-two-slices,<br>which will cheat hunger for an hour or two. He taught me how to live, food,<br>bed, tobacco, and all, at the rate of half a crown a day. And he managed to<br>earn a few extra shillings by 'glimming' in the evenings. It was a<br>precarious job, because illegal, but it brought in a little and eked out<br>our money.<br><br>One morning we tried for a job as sandwich men. We went at five to an<br>alley-way behind some offices, but there was already a queue of thirty or<br>forty men waiting, and after two hours we were told that there was no work<br>for us. We had not missed much, for sandwich men have an unenviable job.<br>They are paid about three shillings a day for ten hours' work--it is hard<br>work, especially in windy weather, and there is no skulking, for an<br>inspector comes round frequently to see that the men are on their beat. To<br>add to their troubles, they are only engaged by the day, or sometimes for<br>three days, never weekly, so that they have to wait hours for their job<br>every morning. The number of unemployed men who are ready to do the work<br>makes them powerless to fight for better treatment. The job all sandwich<br>men covet is distributing handbills, which is paid for at the same rate.<br>When you see a man distributing handbills you can do him a good turn by<br>taking one, for he goes off duty when he has distributed all his bills.<br><br>Meanwhile we went on with the lodging-house life--a squalid,<br>eventless life of crushing boredom. For days together there was nothing to<br>do but sit in the underground kitchen, reading yesterday's newspaper, or,<br>when one could get hold of it, a back number of the UNION JACK. It rained a<br>great deal at this time, and everyone who came in Steamed, so that the<br>kitchen stank horribly. One's only excitement was the periodical<br>tea-and-two-slices. I do not know how many men are living this life in<br>London--it must be thousands at the least. As to Paddy, it was actually<br>the best life he had known for two years past. His interludes from<br>tramping, the times when he had somehow laid hands on a few shillings, had<br>all been like this; the tramping itself had been slightly worse. Listening<br>to his whimpering voice--he was always whimpering when he was not eating<br>--one realized what torture unemployment must be to him. People are wrong<br>when they think that an unemployed man only worries about losing his wages;<br>on the contrary, an illiterate man, with the work habit in his bones, needs<br>work even more than he needs money. An educated man can put up with<br>enforced idleness, which is one of the worst evils of poverty. But a man<br>like Paddy, with no means of filling up time, is as miserable out of work<br>as a dog on the chain. That is why it is such nonsense to pretend that<br>those who have 'come down in the world' are to be pitied above all others.<br>The man who really merits pity is the man who has been down from the start,<br>and faces poverty with a blank, resourceless mind.<br><br>It was a dull rime, and little of it stays in my mind, except for<br>talks with Bozo. Once the lodging-house was invaded by a slumming-party.<br>Paddy and I had been out, and, coming back in the afternoon, we heard<br>sounds of music downstairs. We went down to find three gentle-people,<br>sleekly dressed, holding a religious service in our kitchen. They Were a<br>grave and reverend seignior in a frock coat, a lady sitting at a portable<br>harmonium, and a chinless youth toying with a crucifix. It appeared that<br>they had marched in and started to hold the service, without any kind of<br>invitation whatever.<br><br>It was a pleasure to see how the lodgers met this intrusion. They did<br>not offer the smallest rudeness to the slummers; they just ignored them. By<br>common consent everyone in the kitchen--a hundred men, perhaps--behaved<br>as though the slummers had not existed. There they stood patiently singing<br>and exhorting, and no more notice was taken of them than if they had been<br>earwigs. The gentleman in the frock coat preached a sermon, but not a word<br>of it was audible; it was drowned in the usual din of songs, oaths, and the<br>clattering of pans. Men sat at their meals and card games three feet away<br>from the harmonium, peaceably ignoring it. Presently the slummers gave it<br>up and cleared out, not insulted in any way, but merely disregarded. No<br>doubt they consoled themselves by thinking how brave they had been, 'freely<br>venturing into the lowest dens,' etc. etc.<br><br>Bozo said that these people came to the lodging-house several times a<br>month. They had influence with the police, and the 'deputy' could not<br>exclude them. It is curious how people take it for granted that they have a<br>right to preach at you and pray over you as soon as your income falls below<br>a certain level.<br><br>After nine days B.'s two pounds was reduced to one and ninepence.<br>Paddy and I set aside eighteenpence for our beds, and spent threepence on<br>the usual tea-and-two-slices, which we shared--an appetizer rather than a<br>meal. By the afternoon we were damnably hungry and Paddy remembered a<br>church near King's Cross Station where a free tea was given once a week to<br>tramps. This was the day, and we decided to go there. Bozo, though it was<br>rainy weather and he was almost penniless, would not come, saying that<br>churches were not his style.<br><br>Outside the church quite a hundred men were waiting, dirty types who<br>had gathered from far and wide at the news of a free tea, like kites round<br>a dead buffalo. Presently the doors opened and a clergyman and some girls<br>shepherded us into a gallery at the top of the church. It was an<br>evangelical church, gaunt and wilfully ugly, with texts about blood and<br>fire blazoned on the walls, and a hymn-book containing twelve hundred and<br>fifty-one hymns; reading some of the hymns, I concluded that the book would<br>do as it stood for an anthology of bad verse. There was to be a service<br>after the tea, and the regular congregation were sitting in the well of the<br>church below. It was a week-day, and there were only a few dozen of them,<br>mostly stringy old women who reminded one of boiling-fowls. We ranged<br>ourselves in the gallery pews and were given our tea; it was a one-pound<br>jam-jar of tea each, with six slices of bread and margarine. As soon as tea<br>was over, a dozen tramps who had stationed themselves near the door bolted<br>to avoid the service; the rest stayed, less from gratitude than lacking the<br>cheek to go.<br><br>The organ let out a few preliminary hoots and the service began. And<br>instantly, as though at a signal, the tramps began to misbehave in the most<br>outrageous way. One would not have thought such scenes possible in a<br>church. All round the gallery men lolled in their pews, laughed, chattered,<br>leaned over and flicked pellets of bread among the congregation; I had to<br>restrain the man next to me, more or less by force, from lighting a<br>cigarette. The tramps treated the service as a purely comic spectacle. It<br>was, indeed, a sufficiently ludicrous service--the kind where there are<br>sudden yells of 'Hallelujah!' and endless extempore prayers--but their<br>behaviour passed all bounds. There was one old fellow in the congregation<br>--Brother Bootle or some such name--who was often called on to lead us<br>in prayer, and whenever he stood up the tramps would begin stamping as<br>though in a theatre; they said that on a previous occasion he had kept up<br>an extempore prayer for twenty-five minutes, until the minister had<br>interrupted him. Once when Brother Bootle stood up a tramp called out, 'Two<br>to one 'e don't beat seven minutes!' so loud that the whole church must<br>hear. It was not long before we were making far more noise than the<br>minister. Sometimes somebody below would send up an indignant 'Hush!' but<br>it made no impression. We had set ourselves to guy the service, and there<br>was no stopping us.<br><br>It was a queer, rather disgusting scene. Below were the handful of<br>simple, well-meaning people, trying hard to worship; and above were the<br>hundred men whom they had fed, deliberately making worship impossible. A<br>ring of dirty, hairy faces grinned down from the gallery, openly jeering.<br>What could a few women and old men do against a hundred hostile tramps?<br>They were afraid of us, and we were frankly bullying them. It was our<br>revenge upon them for having humiliated us by feeding us.<br><br>The minister was a brave man. He thundered steadily through a long<br>sermon on Joshua, and managed almost to ignore the sniggers and chattering<br>from above. But in the end, perhaps goaded beyond endurance, he announced<br>loudly:<br><br>'I shall address the last five minutes of my sermon to the UNSAVED<br>sinners!'<br><br>Having said which, he turned his face to the gallery and kept it so<br>for five minutes, lest there should be any doubt about who were saved and<br>who unsaved. But much we cared! Even while the minister was threatening<br>hell fire, we were rolling cigarettes, and at the last amen we clattered<br>down the stairs with a yell, many agreeing to come back for another free<br>tea next week.<br><br>The scene had interested me. It was so different from the ordinary<br>demeanour of tramps--from the abject worm-like gratitude with which they<br>normally accept charity. The explanation, of course, was that we<br>outnumbered the congregation and so were not afraid of them. A man<br>receiving charity practically always hates his benefactor--it is a fixed<br>characteristic of human nature; and, when he has fifty or a hundred others<br>to back him, he will show it.<br><br>In the evening, after the free tea, Paddy unexpectedly earned another<br>eighteenpence at 'glimming'. It was exactly enough for another night's<br>lodging, and we put it aside and went hungry till nine the next evening.<br>Bozo, who might have given us some food, was away all day. The pavements<br>were wet, and he had gone to the Elephant and Castle, where he knew of a<br>pitch under shelter. Luckily I still had some tobacco, so that the day<br>might have been worse.<br><br>At half past eight Paddy took me to the Embankment, where a clergyman<br>was known to distribute meal tickets once a week. Under Charing Cross<br>Bridge fifty men were waiting, mirrored in the shivering puddles. Some of<br>them were truly appalling specimens--they were Embankment sleepers, and<br>the Embankment dredges up worse types than the spike. One of them, I<br>remember, was dressed in an overcoat without buttons, laced up with rope, a<br>pair of ragged trousers, and boots exposing his toes--not a rag else. He<br>was bearded like a fakir, and he had managed to streak his chest and<br>shoulders with some horrible black filth resembling train oil. What one<br>could see of his face under the dirt and hair was bleached white as paper<br>by some malignant disease. I heard him speak, and he had a goodish accent,<br>as of a clerk or shopwalker.<br><br>Presently the clergyman appeared and the men ranged themselves in a<br>queue in the order in which they had arrived. The clergyman was a nice,<br>chubby, youngish man, and, curiously enough, very like Charlie, my friend<br>in Paris. He was shy and embarrassed, and did not speak except for a brief<br>good evening; he simply hurried down the line of men, thrusting a ticket<br>upon each, and not waiting to be thanked. The consequence was that, for<br>once, there was genuine gratitude, and everyone said that the clergyman was<br>a--good feller. Someone (in his hearing, I believe) called out: 'Well,<br>HE'LL never be a--bishop!'--this, of course, intended as a warm<br>compliment.<br><br>The tickets were worth sixpence each, and were directed to an<br>eating-house not far away. When we got there we found that the proprietor,<br>knowing that the tramps could not go elsewhere, was cheating by only giving<br>four pennyworth of food for each ticket. Paddy and I pooled our tickets,<br>and received food which we could have got for sevenpence or eightpence at<br>most coffee-shops. The clergyman had distributed well over a pound in<br>tickets, so that the proprietor was evidently swindling the tramps to the<br>tune of seven shillings or more a week. This kind of victimization is a<br>regular part of a tramp's life, and it will go on as long as people<br>continue to give meal tickets instead of money.<br><br>Paddy and I went back to the lodging-house and, still hungry, loafed<br>in the kitchen, making the warmth of the fire a substitute for food. At<br>half-past ten Bozo arrived, tired out and haggard, for his mangled leg made<br>walking an agony. He had not earned a penny at screeving, all the pitches<br>under shelter being taken, and for several hours he had begged outright,<br>with one eye on the policemen. He had amassed eightpence--a penny short<br>of his kip. It was long past the hour for paying, and he had only managed<br>to slip indoors when the deputy was not looking; at any moment he might be<br>caught and turned out, to sleep on the Embankment. Bozo took the things out<br>of his pockets and looked them over, debating what to sell. He decided on<br>his razor, took it round the kitchen, and in a few minutes he had sold it<br>for threepence--enough to pay his kip, buy a basin of tea, and leave a<br>half-penny over.<br><br>Bozo got his basin of tea and sat down by the fire to dry his clothes.<br>As he drank the tea I saw that he was laughing to himself, as though at<br>some good joke. Surprised, I asked him what he had to laugh at.<br><br>'It's bloody funny!' he said. 'It's funny enough for PUNCH. What do<br>you think I been and done?'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Sold my razor without having a shave first: Of all the--fools!'<br><br>He had not eaten since the morning, had walked several miles with a<br>twisted leg, his clothes were drenched, and he had a halfpenny between<br>himself and starvation. With all this, he could laugh over the loss of his<br>razor. One could not help admiring him.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/31.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/33.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
