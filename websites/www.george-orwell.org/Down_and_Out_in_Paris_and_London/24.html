<h2>Chapter XXV</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>The eight shillings lasted three days and four nights. After my bad<br>experience in the Waterloo Road* I moved eastward, and spent the next<br>night in a lodging-house in Pennyfields. This was a typical lodging-house,<br>like scores of others in London. It had accommodation for between fifty and<br>a hundred men, and was managed by a 'deputy'--a deputy for the owner,<br>that is, for these lodging-houses are profitable concerns and are owned by<br>rich men. We slept fifteen or twenty in a dormitory; the beds were again<br>cold and hard, but the sheets were not more than a week from the wash,<br>which was an improvement. The charge was ninepence or a shilling (in the<br>shilling dormitory the beds were six feet apart instead of four) and the<br>terms were cash down by seven in the evening or out you went.<br><br>[*It is a curious but well-known fact that bugs are much commoner<br>in south than north London. For some reason they have not yet crossed<br>the river in any great numbers.]<br><br>Downstairs there was a kitchen common to all lodgers, with free firing<br>and a supply of cooking-pots, tea-basins, and toasting-forks. There were<br>two great clinker fires, which were kept burning day and night the year<br>through. The work of tending the fires, sweeping the kitchen and making the<br>beds was done by the lodgers in rotation. One senior lodger, a fine<br>Norman-looking stevedore named Steve, was known as 'head of the house', and<br>was arbiter of disputes and unpaid chucker-out.<br><br>I liked the kitchen. It was a low-ceiled cellar deep underground, very<br>hot and drowsy with coke fumes, and lighted only by the fires, which cast<br>black velvet shadows in the comers. Ragged washing hung on strings from the<br>ceiling. Red-lit men, stevedores mostly, moved about the fires with<br>cooking-pots; some of them were quite naked, for they had been laundering<br>and were waiting for their clothes to dry. At night there were games of nap<br>and draughts, and songs--' I'm a chap what's done wrong by my parents,'<br>was a favourite, and so was another popular song about a shipwreck.<br>Sometimes late at night men would come in with a pail of winkles they had<br>bought cheap, and share them out. There was a general sharing of food, and<br>it was taken for granted to feed men who were out of work. A little pale,<br>wizened creature, obviously dying, referred to as 'pore Brown, bin under<br>the doctor and cut open three times,' was regularly fed by the others.<br><br>Two or three of the lodgers were old-age pensioners. Till meeting them<br>I had never realized that there are people in England who live on nothing<br>but the old-age pension often shillings a week. None of these old men had<br>any other resource whatever. One of them was talkative, and I asked him how<br>he managed to exist. He said:<br><br>'Well, there's ninepence a night for yer kip--that's five an'<br>threepence a week. Then there's threepence on Saturday for a shave--<br>that's five an' six. Then say you 'as a 'aircut once a month for sixpence<br>--that's another three'apence a week. So you 'as about four an' four-pence<br>for food an' bacca.'<br><br>He could imagine no other expenses. His food was bread and margarine<br>and tea--towards the end of the week dry bread and tea without milk--<br>and perhaps he got his clothes from charity. He seemed contented, valuing<br>his bed and fire more than food. But, with an income of ten shillings a<br>week, to spend money on a shave--it is awe-inspiring.<br><br>All day I loafed in the streets, east as far as Wapping, west as far<br>as Whitechapel. It was queer after Paris; everything was so much cleaner<br>and quieter and drearier. One missed the scream of the trams, and the<br>noisy, festering life of the back streets, and the armed men clattering<br>through the squares. The crowds were better dressed and the faces comelier<br>and milder and more alike, without that fierce individuality and malice of<br>the French. There was less drunkenness, and less dirt, and less<br>quarrelling, and more idling. Knots of men stood at all the corners,<br>slightly underfed, but kept going by the tea-and-two-slices which the<br>Londoner swallows every two hours. One seemed to breathe a less feverish<br>air than in Paris. It was the land of the tea urn and the Labour Exchange,<br>as Paris is the land of the BISTRO and the sweatshop.<br><br>It was interesting to watch the crowds. The East London women are<br>pretty (it is the mixture of blood, perhaps), and Limehouse was sprinkled<br>with Orientals--Chinamen, Ghittagonian lascars, Dravidians selling silk<br>scarves, even a few Sikhs, come goodness knows how. Here and there were<br>street meetings. In Whitechapel somebody called The Singing Evangel<br>undertook to save you from hell for the charge of sixpence. In the East<br>India Dock Road the Salvation Army were holding a service. They were<br>singing 'Anybody here like sneaking Judas?' to the tune of 'What's to be<br>done with a drunken sailor?' On Tower Hill two Mormons were trying to<br>address a meeting. Round their platform struggled a mob of men, shouting<br>and interrupting. Someone was denouncing them for polygamists. A lame,<br>bearded man, evidently an atheist, had heard the word God and was heckling<br>angrily. There was a confused uproar of voices.<br><br>'My dear friends, if you would only let us finish what we were saying<br>--!--That's right, give 'em a say. Don't get on the argue!--No, no,<br>you answer me. Can you SHOW me God? You SHOW 'im me, then I'll believe in<br>'im.--Oh, shut up, don't keep interrupting of 'em!--Interrupt yourself!<br>--polygamists!--Well, there's a lot to be said for polygamy. Take the--<br>women out of industry, anyway.--My dear friends, if you would just--No,<br>no, don't you slip out of it. 'Ave you SEEN God? 'Ave you TOUCHED 'im? 'Ave<br>you shook 'ANDS with 'im?--Oh, don't get on the argue, for Christ's sake<br>don't get on the ARGUE!' etc. etc. I listened for twenty minutes, anxious<br>to learn something about Mormonism, but the meeting never got beyond<br>shouts. It is the general fate of street meetings.<br><br>In Middlesex Street, among the crowds at the market, a draggled,<br>down-at-heel woman was hauling a brat of five by the arm. She brandished a<br>tin trumpet in its face. The brat was squalling.<br><br>'Enjoy yourself!' yelled the mother. 'What yer think I brought yer out<br>'ere for an' bought y' a trumpet an' all? D'ya want to go across my knee?<br>You little bastard, you SHALL enjoy yerself!'<br><br>Some drops of spittle fell from the trumpet. The mother and the child<br>disappeared, both bawling. It was all very queer after Paris.<br><br>The last night that I was in the Pennyfields lodging-house there was a<br>quarrel between two of the lodgers, a vile scene. One of the old-age<br>pensioners, a man of about seventy, naked to the waist (he had been<br>laundering), was violently abusing a short, thickset stevedore, who stood<br>with his back to the fire. I could see the old man's face in the light of<br>the fire, and he was almost crying with grief and rage. Evidently something<br>very serious had happened.<br><br>THE OLD-AGE PENSIONER:'You--!'<br><br>THE STEVEDORE: 'Shut yer mouth, you ole--, afore I set about yer!'<br><br>THE OLD-AGE PENSIONER: 'Jest you try it on, you--! I'm thirty year<br>older'n you, but it wouldn't take much to make me give you one as'd knock<br>you into a bucketful of piss!'<br><br>THE STEVEDORE: 'Ah, an' then p'raps I wouldn't smash you up after, you<br>ole--!'<br><br>Thus for five minutes. The lodgers sat round, unhappy, trying to<br>disregard the quarrel. The stevedore looked, sullen, but the old man was<br>growing more and more furious. He kept making little rushes at the other,<br>sticking out his face and screaming from a few inches distant like a cat on<br>a wall, and spitting. He was trying to nerve himself to strike a blow, and<br>not quite succeeding. Finally he burst out:<br><br>'A--, that's what you are, a----! Take that in your dirty gob and<br>suck it, you--! By--, I'll smash you afore I've done with you. A--,<br>that's what you are, a son of a--whore. Lick that, you--! That's what I<br>think of you, you--, you--, you--you BLACK BASTARD!'<br><br>Whereat he suddenly collapsed on a bench, took his face in his hands,<br>and began crying. The other man seeing that public feeling was against him,<br>went out.<br><br>Afterwards I heard Steve explaining the cause of the quarrel. It<br>appeared that it was all about a shilling's worth of food. In some way the<br>old man had lost his store of bread and margarine, and so would have<br>nothing to eat for the next three days, except what the others gave him in<br>charity. The stevedore, who was in work and well fed, had taunted him;<br>hence the quarrel.<br><br>When my money was down to one and fourpence I went for a night to a<br>lodging-house in Bow, where the charge was only eightpence. One went down<br>an area and through an alley-way into a deep, stifling cellar, ten feet<br>square. Ten men, navvies mostly, were sitting in the fierce glare of the<br>fire. It was midnight, but the deputy's son, a pale, sticky child of five,<br>was there playing on the navvies' knees. An old Irishman was whistling to a<br>blind bullfinch in a tiny cage. There were other songbirds there--tiny,<br>faded things, that had lived all their lives underground. The lodgers<br>habitually made water in the fire, to save going across a yard to the<br>lavatory. As I sat at the table I felt something stir near my feet, and,<br>looking down, saw a wave of black things moving slowly across the floor;<br>they were black-beetles.<br><br>There were six beds in the dormitory, and the sheets, marked in huge<br>letters 'Stolen from No.--Road', smelt loathsome. In the next bed to me<br>lay a very old man, a pavement artist, with some extraordinary curvature of<br>the spine that made him stick right out of bed, with his back a foot or two<br>from my face. It was bare, and marked with curious swirls of dirt, like a<br>marble table-top. During the night a man came in drunk and was sick on the<br>floor, close to my bed. There were bugs too--not so bad as in Paris, but<br>enough to keep one awake. It was a filthy place. Yet the deputy and his<br>wife were friendly people, and ready to make one a cup of tea at any hour<br>of the day or night.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/23.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/25.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
