<h2>Chapter XXVI</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>In the morning after paying for the usual tea-and-two-slices and<br>buying half an ounce of tobacco, I had a halfpenny left. I did not care to<br>ask B. for more money yet, so there was nothing for it but to go to a<br>casual ward. I had very little idea how to set about this, but I knew that<br>there was a casual ward at Romton, so I walked out there, arriving at three<br>or four in the afternoon. Leaning against the pigpens in Romton<br>market-place was a wizened old Irishman, obviously a tramp. I went and<br>leaned beside him, and presently offered him my tobacco-box. He opened the<br>box and looked at the tobacco in astonishment:<br><br>'By God,' he said, 'dere's sixpennorth o' good baccy here! Where de<br>hell d'you get hold o' dat? YOU ain't been on de road long.'<br><br>'What, don't you have tobacco on the road?' I said.<br><br>'Oh, we HAS it. Look.'<br><br>He produced a rusty tin which had once held Oxo Cubes. In it were<br>twenty or thirty cigarette ends, picked up from the pavement. The Irishman<br>said that he rarely got any other tobacco; he added that, with care, one<br>could collect two ounces of tobacco a day on the London pavements.<br><br>'D'you come out o' one o' de London spikes [casual wards], eh?' he<br>asked me.<br><br>I said yes, thinking this would make him accept me as a fellow tramp,<br>and asked him what the spike at Romton was like. He said:<br><br>'Well, 'tis a cocoa spike. Dere's tay spikes, and cocoa spikes, and<br>skilly spikes. Dey don't give you skilly in Romton, t'ank God--leastways,<br>dey didn't de last time I was here. I been up to York and round Wales<br>since.'<br><br>'What is skilly?' I said.<br><br>'Skilly? A can o' hot water wid some bloody oatmeal at de bottom;<br>dat's skilly. De skilly spikes is always de worst.'<br><br>We stayed talking for an hour or two. The Irishman was a friendly old<br>man, but he smelt very unpleasant, which was not surprising when one<br>learned how many diseases he suffered from. It appeared (he described his<br>symptoms fully) that taking him from top to bottom he had the following<br>things wrong with him: on his crown, which was bald, he had eczema; he was<br>shortsighted, and had no glasses; he had chronic bronchitis; he had some<br>undiagnosed pain in the back; he had dyspepsia; he had urethritis; he had<br>varicose veins, bunions and flat feet. With this assemblage of diseases he<br>had tramped the roads for fifteen years.<br><br>At about five the Irishman said, 'Could you do wid a cup o' tay? De<br>spike don't open till six.'<br><br>'I should think I could.'<br><br>'Well, dere's a place here where dey gives you a free cup o' tay and a<br>bun. GOOD tay it is. Dey makes you say a lot o' bloody prayers after; but<br>hell! It all passes de time away. You come wid me.'<br><br>He led the way to a small tin-roofed shed in a side-street, rather<br>like a village cricket pavilion. About twenty-five other tramps were<br>waiting. A few of them were dirty old habitual vagabonds, the majority<br>decent-looking lads from the north, probably miners or cotton operatives<br>out of work. Presently the door opened and a lady in a blue silk dress,<br>wearing gold spectacles and a crucifix, welcomed us in. Inside were thirty<br>or forty hard chairs, a harmonium, and a very gory lithograph of the<br>Crucifixion.<br><br>Uncomfortably we took off our caps and sat down. The lady handed out<br>the tea, and while we ate and drank she moved to and fro, talking benignly.<br>She talked upon religious subjects--about Jesus Christ always having a<br>soft spot for poor rough men like us, and about how quickly the time passed<br>when you were in church, and what a difference it made to a man on the road<br>if he said his prayers regularly. We hated it. We sat against the wall<br>fingering our caps (a tramp feels indecently exposed with his cap off), and<br>turning pink and trying to mumble something when the lady addressed us.<br>There was no doubt that she meant it all kindly. As she came up to one of<br>the north country lads with the plate of buns, she said to him:<br><br>'And you, my boy, how long is it since you knelt down and spoke with<br>your Father in Heaven?'<br><br>Poor lad, not a word could he utter; but his belly answered for him,<br>with a disgraceful rumbling which it set up at sight of the food.<br>Thereafter he was so overcome with shame that he could scarcely swallow his<br>bun. Only one man managed to answer the lady in her own style, and he was a<br>spry, red-nosed fellow looking like a corporal who had lost his stripe for<br>drunkenness. He could pronounce the words 'the dear Lord Jesus' with less<br>shame than anyone I ever saw. No doubt he had learned the knack in prison.<br><br>Tea ended, and I saw the tramps looking furtively at one another. An<br>unspoken thought was running from man to man--could we possibly make off<br>before the prayers started? Someone stirred in his chair--not getting up<br>actually, but with just a glance at the door, as though half suggesting the<br>idea of departure. The lady quelled him with one look. She said in a more<br>benign tone than ever:<br><br>'I don't think you need go QUITE yet. The casual ward doesn't open<br>till six, and we have time to kneel down and say a few words to our Father<br>first. I think we should all feel better after that, shouldn't we?'<br><br>The red-nosed man was very helpful, pulling the harmonium into place<br>and handing out the prayerbooks. His back was to the lady as he did this,<br>and it was his idea of a joke to deal the books like a pack of cards,<br>whispering to each man as he did so, 'There y'are, mate, there's a--nap<br>'and for yer! Four aces and a king!' etc.<br><br>Bareheaded, we knelt down among the dirty teacups and began to mumble<br>that we had left undone those things that we ought to have done, and done<br>those things that we ought not to have done, and there was no health in us.<br>The lady prayed very fervently, but her eyes roved over us all the time,<br>making sure that we were attending. When she was not looking we grinned and<br>winked at one another, and whispered bawdy jokes, just to show that we did<br>not care; but it stuck in our throats a little. No one except the red-nosed<br>man was self-possessed enough to speak the responses above a whisper. We<br>got on better with the singing, except that one old tramp knew no tune but<br>'Onward, Christian soldiers', and reverted to it sometimes, spoiling the<br>harmony.<br><br>The prayers lasted half an hour, and then, after a handshake at the<br>door, we made off. 'Well,' said somebody as soon as we were out of hearing,<br>'the trouble's over. I thought them--prayers was never goin' to end.'<br><br>'You 'ad your bun,' said another; 'you got to pay for it.'<br><br>'Pray for it, you mean. Ah, you don't get much for nothing. They can't<br>even give you a twopenny cup of tea without you go down on you--knees for<br>it.'<br><br>There were murmurs of agreement. Evidently the tramps were not<br>grateful for their tea. And yet it was excellent tea, as different from<br>coffee-shop tea as good Bordeaux is from the muck called colonial claret,<br>and we were all glad of it. I am sure too that it was given in a good<br>spirit, without any intention of humiliating us; so in fairness we ought to<br>have been grateful--still, we were not.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/24.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/26.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
