<h2>Chapter X</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>The Hotel X was a vast, grandiose place with a classical facade, and<br>at one side a little, dark doorway like a rat-hole, which was the service<br>entrance. I arrived at a quarter to seven in the morning. A stream of men<br>with greasy trousers were hurrying in and being checked by a doorkeeper who<br>sat in a tiny office. I waited, and presently the CHEF DU PERSONNEL, a sort<br>of assistant manager, arrived and began to question me. He was an Italian,<br>with a round, pale face, haggard from overwork. He asked whether I was an<br>experienced dishwasher, and I said that I was; he glanced at my hands and<br>saw that I was lying, but on hearing that I was an Englishman he changed<br>his tone and engaged me.<br><br>'We have been looking for someone to practise our English on,' he<br>said. 'Our clients are all Americans, and the only English we know is----'<br>He repeated something that little boys write on the walls in London. 'You<br>may be useful. Come downstairs.'<br><br>He led me down a winding staircase into a narrow passage, deep<br>underground, and so low that I had to stoop in places. It was stiflingly<br>hot and very dark, with only dim, yellow bulbs several yards apart. There<br>seemed to be miles of dark labyrinthine passages--actually, I suppose, a<br>few hundred yards in all--that reminded one queerly of the lower decks of<br>a liner; there were the same heat and cramped space and warm reek of food,<br>and a humming, whirring noise (it came from the kitchen furnaces) just like<br>the whir of engines. We passed doorways which let out sometimes a shouting<br>of oaths, sometimes the red glare of a fire, once a shuddering draught from<br>an ice chamber. As we went along, something struck me violently in the<br>back. It was a hundred-pound block of ice, carried by a blue-aproned<br>porter. After him came a boy with a great slab of veal on his shoulder, his<br>cheek pressed into the damp, spongy flesh. They shoved me aside with a cry<br>of 'SAUVE-TOI, IDIOT!' and rushed on. On the wall, under one of the lights,<br>someone had written in a very neat hand: 'Sooner will you find a cloudless<br>sky in winter, than a woman at the Hotel X who has her maidenhead.' It<br>seemed a queer sort of place.<br><br>One of the passages branched off into a laundry, where an old,<br>skull-faced woman gave me a blue apron and a pile of dishcloths. Then the<br>CHEF DU PERSONNEL took me to a tiny underground den--a cellar below a<br>cellar, as it were--where there were a sink and some gas-ovens. It was<br>too low for me to stand quite upright, and the temperature was perhaps 110<br>degrees Fahrenheit. The CHEF DU PERSONNEL explained that my job was to<br>fetch meals for the higher hotel employees, who fed in a small dining-room<br>above, clean their room and wash their crockery. When he had gone, a<br>waiter, another Italian, thrust a fierce, fuzzy head into the doorway and<br>looked down at me.<br><br>'English, eh?' he said. 'Well, I'm in charge here. If you work well'<br>--he made the motion of up-ending a bottle and sucked noisily. 'If you<br>don't'--he gave the doorpost several vigorous kicks. 'To me, twisting<br>your neck would be no more than spitting on the floor. And if there's any<br>trouble, they'll believe me, not you. So be careful.'<br><br>After this I set to work rather hurriedly. Except for about an hour, I<br>was at work from seven in the morning till a quarter past nine at night;<br>first at washing crockery, then at scrubbing the tables and floors of the<br>employees' dining-room, then at polishing glasses and knives, then at<br>fetching meals, then at washing crockery again, then at fetching more meals<br>and washing more crockery. It was easy work, and I got on well with it<br>except when I went to the kitchen to fetch meals. The kitchen was like<br>nothing I had ever seen or imagined--a stifling, low-ceilinged inferno of<br>a cellar, red-lit from the fires, and deafening with oaths and the clanging<br>of pots and pans. It was so hot that all the metal-work except the stoves<br>had to be covered with cloth. In the middle were furnaces, where twelve<br>cooks skipped to and fro, their faces dripping sweat in spite of their<br>white caps. Round that were counters where a mob of waiters and PLONGEURS<br>clamoured with trays. Scullions, naked to the waist, were stoking the fires<br>and scouring huge copper saucepans with sand. Everyone seemed to be in a<br>hurry and a rage. The head cook, a fine, scarlet man with big moustachios,<br>stood in the middle booming continuously, 'CA MARCHE DEUX AUFS BROUILLES!<br>CA MARCHE UN CHATEAUBRIAND AUX POMMES SAUTEES!' except when he broke off to<br>curse at a PLONGEUR. There were three counters, and the first time I went<br>to the kitchen I took my tray unknowingly to the wrong one. The head cook<br>walked up to me, twisted his moustaches, and looked me up and down. Then he<br>beckoned to the breakfast cook and pointed at me.<br><br>'Do you see THAT? That is the type of PLONGEUR they send us nowadays.<br>Where do you come from, idiot? From Charenton, I suppose?' (There is a<br>large lunatic asylum at Charenton.)<br><br>'From England,' I said.<br><br>'I might have known it. Well, MAN CHER MONSIEUR L'ANGLAIS, may I<br>inform you that you are the son of a whore? And now--the camp to the<br>other counter, where you belong.'<br><br>I got this kind of reception every time I went to the kitchen, for I<br>always made some mistake; I was expected to know the work, and was cursed<br>accordingly. From curiosity I counted the number of times I was called<br>MAQUEREAU during the day, and it was thirty-nine.<br><br>At half past four the Italian told me that I could stop working, but<br>that it was not worth going out, as we began at five. I went to the<br>lavatory for a smoke; smoking was strictly forbidden, and Boris had warned<br>me that the lavatory was the only safe place. After that I worked again<br>till a quarter past nine, when the waiter put his head into the doorway and<br>told me to leave the rest of the crockery. To my astonishment, after<br>calling me pig, mackerel, etc., all day, he had suddenly grown quite<br>friendly. I realized that the curses I had met with were only a kind of<br>probation.<br><br>'That'll do, MAN P'TIT,' said the waiter. 'TU N'ES PAS DEBROUILLARD,<br>but you work all right. Come up and have your dinner. The hotel allows us<br>two litres of wine each, and I've stolen another bottle. We'll have a fine<br>booze.'<br><br>We had an excellent dinner from the leavings of the higher employees.<br>The waiter, grown mellow, told me stories about his love-affairs, and about<br>two men whom he had stabbed in Italy, and about how he had dodged Us<br>military service. He was a good fellow when one got to know him; he<br>reminded me of Benvenuto Cellini, somehow. I was tired and drenched with<br>sweat, but I felt a new man after a day's solid food. The work did not seem<br>difficult, and I felt that this job would suit me. It was not certain,<br>however, that it would continue, for I had been engaged as an 'extra' for<br>the day only, at twenty-five francs. The sour-faced doorkeeper counted out<br>the money, less fifty centimes which he said was for insurance (a lie, I<br>discovered afterwards). Then he stepped out into the passage, made me take<br>off my coat, and carefully prodded me all over, searching for stolen food.<br>After this the CHEF DU PERSONNEL appeared and spoke to me. Like the waiter,<br>he had grown more genial on seeing that I was willing to work.<br><br>'We will give you a permanent job if you like,' he said. 'The head<br>waiter says he would enjoy calling an Englishman names. Will you sign on<br>for a month?'<br><br>Here was a job at last, and I was ready to jump at it. Then I<br>remembered the Russian restaurant, due to open in a fortnight. It seemed<br>hardly fair to promise working a month, and then leave in the middle. I<br>said that I had other work in prospect--could I be engaged for a<br>fortnight? But at that the CHEF DU PERSONNEL shrugged his shoulders and<br>said that the hotel only engaged men by the month. Evidently I had lost my<br>chance of a job.<br><br>Boris, by arrangement, was waiting for me in the Arcade of the Rue de<br>Rivoli. When I told him what had happened, he was furious. For the first<br>time since I had known him he forgot his manners and called me a fool.<br><br>'Idiot! Species of idiot! What's the good of my finding you a job when<br>you go and chuck it up the next moment? How could you be such a fool as to<br>mention the other restaurant? You'd only to promise you would work for a<br>month.'<br><br>'It seemed more honest to say I might have to leave,' I objected.<br><br>'Honest! Honest! Who ever heard of a PLONGEUR being honest? MON AMI'<br>--suddenly he seized my lapel and spoke very earnestly--'MON AMI, you<br>have worked here all day. You see what hotel work is like. Do you think a<br>PLONGEUR can afford a sense of honour?'<br><br>'No, perhaps not.'<br><br>'Well, then, go back quickly and tell the CHEF DU PERSONNEL you are<br>quite ready to work for a month. Say you will throw the other job over.<br>Then, when our restaurant opens, we have only to walk out.'<br><br>'But what about my wages if I break my contract?<br><br>'Boris banged his stick on the pavement and cried out at such<br>stupidity. 'Ask to be paid by the day, then you won't lose a sou. Do you<br>suppose they would prosecute a PLONGEUR for breaking Us contract? A<br>PLONGEUR is too low to be prosecuted.'<br><br>I hurried back, found the CHEF DU PERSONNEL, and told him that I would<br>work for a month, whereat he signed me on. Ibis was my first lesson in<br>PLONGEUR morality. Later I realized how foolish it had been to have any<br>scruples, for the big hotels are quite merciless towards their employees.<br>They engage or discharge men as the work demands, and they all sack ten per<br>cent or more of their staff when the season is over. Nor have they any<br>difficulty in replacing a man who leaves at short notice, for Paris is<br>thronged by hotel employees out of work.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/8.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/10.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
