<h2>Chapter III</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>I lived in the Coq d'Or quarter for about a year and a half. One day,<br>in summer, I found that I had just four hundred and fifty francs left, and<br>beyond this nothing but thirty-six francs a week, which I earned by giving<br>English lessons. Hitherto I had not thought about the future, but I now<br>realized that I must do something at once. I decided to start looking for a<br>job, and--very luckily, as it turned out--I took the precaution of<br>paying two hundred francs for a month's rent in advance. With the other two<br>hundred and fifty francs, besides the English lessons, I could live a<br>month, and in a month I should probably find work. I aimed at becoming a<br>guide to one of the tourist companies, or perhaps an interpreter. However,<br>a piece of bad luck prevented this.<br><br>One day there turned up at the hotel a young Italian who called<br>himself a compositor. He was rather an ambiguous person, for he wore side<br>whiskers, which are the mark either of an apache or an intellectual, and<br>nobody was quite certain in which class to put him. Madame F. did not like<br>the look of him, and made him pay a week's rent in advance. The Italian<br>paid the rent and stayed six nights at the hotel. During this time he<br>managed to prepare some duplicate keys, and on the last night he robbed a<br>dozen rooms, including mine. Luckily, he did not find the money that was in<br>my pockets, so I was not left penniless. I was left with just forty-seven<br>francs--that is, seven and tenpence.<br><br>This put an end to my plans of looking for work. I had now got to live<br>at the rate of about six francs a day, and from the start it was too<br>difficult to leave much thought for anything else. It was now that my<br>experiences of poverty began--for six francs a day, if not actual<br>poverty, is on the fringe of it. Six francs is a shilling, and you can live<br>on a shilling a day in Paris if you know how. But it is a complicated<br>business.<br><br>It is altogether curious, your first contact with poverty. You have<br>thought so much about poverty--it is the thing you have feared all your<br>life, the thing you knew would happen to you sooner or later; and it, is<br>all so utterly and prosaically different. You thought it would be quite<br>simple; it is extraordinarily complicated. You thought it would be<br>terrible; it is merely squalid and boring. It is the peculiar LOWNESS of<br>poverty that you discover first; the shifts that it puts you to, the<br>complicated meanness, the crust-wiping.<br><br>You discover, for instance, the secrecy attaching to poverty. At a<br>sudden stroke you have been reduced to an income of six francs a day. But<br>of course you dare not admit it--you have got to pretend that you are<br>living quite as usual. From the start it tangles you in a net of lies, and<br>even with the lies you can hardly manage it. You stop sending clothes to<br>the laundry, and the laundress catches you in the street and asks you why;<br>you mumble something, and she, thinking you are sending the clothes<br>elsewhere, is your enemy for life. The tobacconist keeps asking why you<br>have cut down your smoking. There are letters you want to answer, and<br>cannot, because stamps are too expensive. And then there are your meals--<br>meals are the worst difficulty of all. Every day at meal-times you go out,<br>ostensibly to a restaurant, and loaf an hour in the Luxembourg Gardens,<br>watching the pigeons. Afterwards you smuggle your food home in your<br>pockets. Your food is bread and margarine, or bread and wine, and even the<br>nature of the food is governed by lies. You have to buy rye bread instead<br>of household bread, because the rye loaves, though dearer, are round and<br>can be smuggled in your pockets. This wastes you a franc a day. Sometimes,<br>to keep up appearances, you have to spend sixty centimes on a drink, and go<br>correspondingly short of food. Your linen gets filthy, and you run out of<br>soap and razor-blades. Your hair wants cutting, and you try to cut it<br>yourself, with such fearful results that you have to go to the barber after<br>all, and spend the equivalent of a day's food. All day you arc telling<br>lies, and expensive lies.<br><br>You discover the extreme precariousness of your six francs a day. Mean<br>disasters happen and rob you of food. You have spent your last eighty<br>centimes on half a litre of milk, and are boiling it over the spirit lamp.<br>While it boils a bug runs down your forearm; you give the bug a flick with<br>your nail, and it falls, plop! straight into the milk. There is nothing for<br>it but to throw the milk away and go foodless.<br><br>You go to the baker's to buy a pound of bread, and you wait while the<br>girl cuts a pound for another customer. She is clumsy, and cuts more than a<br>pound. 'PARDON, MONSIEUR,' she says, 'I suppose you don't mind paying two<br>sous extra?' Bread is a franc a pound, and you have exactly a franc. When<br>you think that you too might be asked to pay two sous extra, and would have<br>to confess that you could not, you bolt in panic. It is hours before you<br>dare venture into a baker's shop again.<br><br>You go to the greengrocer's to spend a franc on a kilogram of<br>potatoes. But one of the pieces that make up the franc is a Belgian piece,<br>and the shopman refuses it. You slink out of the shop, and can never go<br>there again.<br><br>You have strayed into a respectable quarter, and you see a prosperous<br>friend coming. To avoid him you dodge into the nearest cafe. Once in the<br>cafe you must buy something, so you spend your last fifty centimes on a<br>glass of black coffee with a dead fly in it. Once could multiply these<br>disasters by the hundred. They are part of the process of being hard up.<br><br>You discover what it is like to be hungry. With bread and margarine in<br>your belly, you go out and look into the shop windows. Everywhere there is<br>food insulting you in huge, wasteful piles; whole dead pigs, baskets of hot<br>loaves, great yellow blocks of butter, strings of sausages, mountains of<br>potatoes, vast Gruyere cheeses like grindstones. A snivelling self-pity<br>comes over you at the sight of so much food. You plan to grab a loaf and<br>run, swallowing it before they catch you; and you refrain, from pure funk.<br><br>You discover the boredom which is inseparable from poverty; the times<br>when you have nothing to do and, being underfed, can interest yourself in<br>nothing. For half a day at a time you lie on your bed, feeling like the<br>JEUNE SQUELETTE in Baudelaire's poem. Only food could rouse you. You<br>discover that a man who has gone even a week on bread and margarine is not<br>a man any longer, only a belly with a few accessory organs.<br><br>This--one could describe it further, but it is all in the same style<br>--is life on six francs a day. Thousands of people in Paris live it--<br>struggling artists and students, prostitutes when their luck is out,<br>out-of-work people of all kinds. It is the suburbs, as it were, of poverty.<br><br>I continued in this style for about three weeks. The forty-seven<br>francs were soon gone, and I had to do what I could on thirty-six francs a<br>week from the English lessons. Being inexperienced, I handled the money<br>badly, and sometimes I was a day without food. When this happened I used to<br>sell a few of my clothes, smuggling them out of the hotel in small packets<br>and taking them to a secondhand shop in the rue de la Montagne St<br>Genevieve. The shopman was a red-haired Jew, an extraordinary disagreeable<br>man, who used to fall into furious rages at the sight of a client. From his<br>manner one would have supposed that we had done him some injury by coming<br>to him. 'MERDE!' he used to shout, 'YOU here again? What do you think this<br>is? A soup kitchen?' And he paid incredibly low prices. For a hat which I<br>had bought for twenty-five shillings and scarcely worn he gave five francs;<br>for a good pair of shoes, five francs; for shirts, a franc each. He always<br>preferred to exchange rather than buy, and he had a trick of thrusting some<br>useless article into one's hand and then pretending that one had accepted<br>it. Once I saw him take a good overcoat from an old woman, put two white<br>billiard-balls into her hand, and then push her rapidly out of the shop<br>before she could protest. It would have been a pleasure to flatten the<br>Jew's nose, if only one could have afforded it.<br><br>These three weeks were squalid and uncomfortable, and evidently there<br>was worse coming, for my rent would be due before long. Nevertheless,<br>things were not a quarter as bad as I had expected. For, when you are<br>approaching poverty, you make one discovery which outweighs some of the<br>others. You discover boredom and mean complications and the beginnings of<br>hunger, but you also discover the great redeeming feature of poverty: the<br>fact that it annihilates the future. Within certain limits, it is actually<br>true that the less money you have, the less you worry. When you have a<br>hundred francs in the world you are liable to the most craven panics. When<br>you have only three francs you are quite indifferent; for three francs will<br>feed you till tomorrow, and you cannot think further than that. You are<br>bored, but you are not afraid. You think vaguely, 'I shall be starving in a<br>day or two--shocking, isn't it?' And then the mind wanders to other<br>topics. A bread and margarine diet does, to some extent, provide its own<br>anodyne.<br><br>And there is another feeling that is a great consolation in poverty. I<br>believe everyone who has been hard up has experienced it. It is a feeling<br>of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing yourself at last genuinely down<br>and out. You have talked so often of going to the dogs--and well, here<br>are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand it. It takes off<br>a lot of anxiety,<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/1.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/3.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
