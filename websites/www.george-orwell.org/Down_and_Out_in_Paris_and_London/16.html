<h2>Chapter XVII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>With thirty francs a week to spend on drinks I could take part in the<br>social life of the quarter. We had some jolly evenings, on Saturdays, in<br>the little BISTRO at the foot of the Hotel des Trois Moineaux.<br><br>The brick-floored room, fifteen feet square, was packed with twenty<br>people, and the air dim with smoke. The noise was deafening, for everyone<br>was either talking at the top of his voice or singing. Sometimes it was<br>just a confused din of voices; sometimes everyone would burst out together<br>in the same song--the 'Marseillaise', or the 'Internationale', or<br>'Madelon', or 'Les Fraises et les Fram-boises'. Azaya, a great clumping<br>peasant girl who worked fourteen hours a day in a glass factory, sang a<br>song about, 'IL A PERDU SES PANTALONS, TOUT EN DANSANT LE CHARLESTON.' Her<br>friend Marinette, a thin, dark Gorsican girl of obstinate virtue, tied her<br>knees together and danced the DANSE DU VENTRE. The old Rougiers wandered in<br>and out, cadging drinks and trying to tell a long, involved story about<br>someone who had once cheated them over a bedstead. R., cadaverous and<br>silent, sat in his comer quietly boozing. Charlie, drunk, half danced, half<br>staggered to and fro with a glass of sham absinthe balanced in one fat<br>hand, pinching the women's breasts and declaiming poetry. People played<br>darts and diced for drinks. Manuel, a Spaniard, dragged the girls to the<br>bar and shook the dice-box against their bellies, for luck. Madame F. stood<br>at the bar rapidly pouring CHOPINES of wine through the pewter funnel, with<br>a wet dishcloth always handy, because every man in the room tried to make<br>love to her. Two children, bastards of big Louis the bricklayer, sat in a<br>comer sharing a glass of SIROP. Everyone was very happy, overwhelmingly<br>certain that the world was a good place and we a notable set of people.<br><br>For an hour the noise scarcely slackened. Then about midnight there<br>was a piercing shout of 'CITOYENS!' and the sound of a chair falling over.<br>A blond, red-faced workman had risen to his feet and was banging a bottle<br>on the table. Everyone stopped singing; the word went round, 'Sh! Furex is<br>starting!' Furex was a strange creature, a Limousin stonemason who worked<br>steadily all the week and drank himself into a kind of paroxysm on<br>Saturdays. He had lost his memory and could not remember anything before<br>the war, and he would have gone to pieces through drink if Madame F. had<br>not taken care of him. On Saturday evenings at about five o'clock she would<br>say to someone, 'Catch Furex before he spends his wages,' and when he had<br>been caught she would take away his money, leaving him enough for one good<br>drink. One week he escaped, and, rolling blind drunk in the Place Monge,<br>was run over by a car and badly hurt.<br><br>The queer thing about Furex was that, though he was a Communist when<br>sober, he turned violently patriotic when drunk. He started the evening<br>with good Communist principles, but after four or five litres he was a<br>rampant Chauvinist, denouncing spies, challenging all foreigners to fight,<br>and, if he was not prevented, throwing bottles. It was at this stage that<br>he made his speech--for he made a patriotic speech every Saturday night.<br>The speech was always the same, word for word. It ran:<br><br>'Citizens of the Republic, are there any Frenchmen here? If there are<br>any Frenchmen here, I rise to remind them--to remind them in effect, of<br>the glorious days of the war. When one looks back upon that time of<br>comradeship and heroism--one looks back, in effect, upon that time of<br>comradeship and heroism. When one remembers the heroes who are dead--one<br>remembers, in effect, the heroes who are dead. Citizens of the Republic, I<br>was wounded at Verdun--'<br><br>Here he partially undressed and showed the wound he had received at<br>Verdun. There were shouts of applause. We thought nothing in the world<br>could be funnier than this speech of Furex's. He was a well-known spectacle<br>in the quarter; people used to come in from other BISTROS to watch him when<br>Us fit started.<br><br>The word was passed round to bait Furex. With a wink to the others<br>someone called for silence, and asked him to sing the 'Marseillaise'. He<br>sang it well, in a fine bass voice, with patriotic gurgling noises deep<br>down in his chest when he came to 'AUX ARRMES, CITOYENS! FORRMEZ VOS<br>BATAILLONS!' Veritable tears rolled down his cheeks; he was too drunk to<br>see that everyone was laughing at him. Then, before he had finished, two<br>strong workmen seized him by either arm and held him down, while Azaya<br>shouted, 'VIVE L'ALLEMAGNE!' just out of his reach. Furex's face went<br>purple at such infamy. Everyone in the BISTRO began shouting together,<br>'VIVE L'ALLEMAGNE! A BAS LA FRANCE!' while Furex struggled to get at them.<br>But suddenly he spoiled the fun. His face turned pale and doleful, his<br>limbs went limp, and before anyone could stop him he was sick on the table.<br>Then Madame F. hoisted him like a sack and carried him up to bed. In the<br>morning he reappeared quiet and civil, and bought a copy of L'HUMANITE.<br><br>The table was wiped with a cloth, Madame F. brought more litre bottles<br>and loaves of bread, and we Settled down to serious drinking. There were<br>more songs. An itinerant singer came in with his banjo and performed for<br>five-sou pieces. An Arab and a girl from the BISTRO down the street did a<br>dance, the man wielding a painted wooden phallus the size of a rolling-pin.<br>There were gaps in the noise now. People had begun to talk about their<br>love-affairs, and the war, and the barbel fishing in the Seine, and the<br>best way to FAIRE LA REVOLUTION, and to tell stories. Charlie, grown sober<br>again, captured the conversation and talked about his soul for five<br>minutes. The doors and windows were opened to cool the room. The street was<br>emptying, and in the distance one could hear the lonely milk train<br>thundering down the Boulevard St Michel. The air blew cold on our<br>foreheads, and the coarse African wine still tasted good: we were still<br>happy, but meditatively, with the shouting and hilarious mood finished.<br><br>By one o'clock we were not happy any longer. We felt the joy of the<br>evening wearing thin, and called hastily for more bottles, but Madame F.<br>was watering the wine now, and it did not taste the same. Men grew<br>quarrelsome. The girls were violently kissed and hands thrust into their<br>bosoms and they made off lest worse should happen. Big Louis, the<br>bricklayer, was drunk, and crawled about the floor barking and pretending<br>to be a dog. The others grew tired of him and kicked at him as he went<br>past. People seized each other by the arm and began long rambling<br>confessions, and were angry when these were not listened to. The crowd<br>thinned. Manuel and another man, both gamblers, went across to the Arab<br>BISTRO, where card-playing went on till daylight. Charlie suddenly borrowed<br>thirty francs from Madame F. and disappeared, probably to a brothel. Men<br>began to empty their glasses, call briefly, ''SIEURS, DAMES!' and go off to<br>bed.<br><br>By half past one the last drop of pleasure had evaporated, leaving<br>nothing but headaches. We perceived that we were not splendid inhabitants<br>of a splendid world, but a crew of underpaid workmen grown squalidly and<br>dismally drunk. We went on swallowing the wine, but it was only from habit,<br>and the stuff seemed suddenly nauseating. One's head had swollen up like a<br>balloon, the floor rocked, one's tongue and lips were stained purple. At<br>last it was no use keeping it up any longer. Several men went out into the<br>yard behind the BISTRO and were sick. We crawled up to bed, tumbled down<br>half dressed, and stayed there ten hours.<br><br>Most of my Saturday nights went in this way. On the whole, the two<br>hours when one was perfectly and wildly happy seemed worth the subsequent<br>headache. For many men in the quarter, unmarried and with no future to<br>think of, the weekly drinking-bout was the one thing that made life worth<br>living.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/15.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/17.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
