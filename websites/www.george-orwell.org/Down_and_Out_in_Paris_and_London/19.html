<h2>Chapter XX</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>The PATRON had engaged me as kitchen PLONGEUR; that is, my job was to<br>wash up, keep the kitchen clean, prepare vegetables, make tea, coffee and<br>sandwiches, do the simpler cooking, and run errands. The terms were, as<br>usual, five hundred francs a month and food, but I had no free day and no<br>fixed working hours. At the Hotel X I had seen catering at its best, with<br>unlimited money and good organization. Now, at the Auberge, I learned how<br>things are done in a thoroughly bad restaurant. It is worth describing, for<br>there are hundreds of similar restaurants in Paris, and every visitor feeds<br>in one of them occasionally.<br><br>I should add, by the way, that the Auberge was not the ordinary cheap<br>eating-house frequented by students and workmen. We did not provide an<br>adequate meal at less than twenty-five francs, and we were picturesque and<br>artistic, which sent up our social standing. There were the indecent<br>pictures in the bar, and the Norman decorations--sham beams on the walls,<br>electric lights done up as candlesticks, 'peasant' pottery, even a<br>mounting-block at the door--and the PATRON and the head waiter were<br>Russian officers, and many of the customers tided Russian refugees. In<br>short, we were decidedly chic.<br><br>Nevertheless, the conditions behind the kitchen door were suitable for<br>a pigsty. For this is what our service arrangements were like.<br><br>The kitchen measured fifteen feet long by eight broad, and half this<br>space was taken up by the stoves and tables. All the pots had to be kept on<br>shelves out of reach, and there was only room for one dustbin. This dustbin<br>used to be crammed full by midday, and the floor was normally an inch deep<br>in a compost of trampled food.<br><br>For firing we had nothing but three gas-stoves, without ovens, and all<br>joints had to be sent out to the bakery.<br><br>There was no larder. Our substitute for one was a half-roofed shed in<br>the yard, with a tree growing in the middle of it. The meat, vegetables and<br>so forth lay there on the bare earth, raided by rats and cats.<br><br>There was no hot water laid on. Water for washing up had to be heated<br>in pans, and, as there was no room for these on the stoves when meals were<br>cooking, most of the plates had to be washed in cold water. This, with soft<br>soap and the hard Paris water, meant scraping the grease off with bits of<br>newspaper.<br><br>We were so short of saucepans that I had to wash each one as soon as<br>it was done with, instead of leaving them till the evening. This alone<br>wasted probably an hour a day.<br><br>Owing to some scamping of expense in the installation, the electric<br>light usually fused at eight in the evening. The PATRON would only allow us<br>three candles in the kitchen, and the cook said three were unlucky, so we<br>had only two.<br><br>Our coffee-grinder was borrowed from a BISTRO near by, and our dustbin<br>and brooms from the concierge. After the first week a quantity of linen did<br>not come back from the wash, as the bill was not paid. We were in trouble<br>with the inspector of labour, who had discovered that the staff included no<br>Frenchmen; he had several private interviews with the PATRON, who, I<br>believe, was obliged to bribe him. The electric company was still dunning<br>us, and when the duns found that we would buy them off with APERITIFS, they<br>came every morning. We were in debt at the grocery, and credit would have<br>been stopped, only the grocer's wife (a moustachio'd woman of sixty) had<br>taken a fancy to Jules, who was sent every morning to cajole her. Similarly<br>I had to waste an hour every day haggling over vegetables in the rue du<br>Commerce, to save a few centimes.<br><br>These are the results of starting a restaurant on insufficient<br>capital. And in these conditions the cook and I were expected to serve<br>thirty or forty meals a day, and would later on be serving a hundred. From<br>the first day it was too much for us. The cook's working hours were from<br>eight in the morning till midnight, and mine from seven in the morning till<br>half past twelve the next morning--seventeen and a half hours, almost<br>without a break. We never had time to sit down till five in the afternoon,<br>and even then there was no seat except the top of the dustbin. Boris, who<br>lived near by and had not to catch the last Metro home, worked from eight<br>in the morning till two the next morning--eighteen hours a day, seven<br>days a week. Such hours, though not usual, are nothing extraordinary in<br>Paris.<br><br>Life settled at once into a routine that made the Hotel X seem like a<br>holiday. Every morning at six I drove myself out of bed, did not shave,<br>sometimes washed, hurried up to the Place d'ltalie and fought for a place<br>on the Metro. By seven I was in the desolation of the cold, filthy kitchen,<br>with the potato skins and bones and fishtails littered on the floor, and a<br>pile of plates, stuck together in their grease, waiting from overnight. I<br>could not start on the plates yet, because the water was cold, and I had to<br>fetch milk and make coffee, for the others arrived at eight and expected to<br>find coffee ready. Also, there were always several copper saucepans to<br>clean. Those copper saucepans are the bane of a PLONGEUR'S life. They have<br>to be scoured with sand and bunches of chain, ten minutes to each one, and<br>then polished on the outside with Brasso. Fortunately, the art of making<br>them has been lost and they are gradually vanishing from French kitchens,<br>though one can still buy them second-hand.<br><br>When I had begun on the plates the cook would take me away from the<br>plates to begin skinning onions, and when I had begun on the onions the<br>PATRON would arrive and send me out to buy cabbages. When I came back with<br>the cabbages the PATRON'S wife would tell me to go to some shop half a mile<br>away and buy a pot of rouge; by the time I came back there would be more<br>vegetables waiting, and the plates were still not done. In this way our<br>incompetence piled one job on another throughout the day, everything in<br>arrears.<br><br>Till ten, things went comparatively easily, though we were working<br>fast, and no one lost his temper. The cook would find time to talk about<br>her artistic nature, and say did I not think Tolstoy was EPATANT, and sing<br>in a fine soprano voice as she minced beef on the board. But at ten the<br>waiters began clamouring for their lunch, which they had early, and at<br>eleven the first customers would be arriving. Suddenly everything became<br>hurry and bad temper. There was not the same furious rushing and yelling as<br>at the Hotel X, but an atmosphere of muddle, petty spite and exasperation.<br>Discomfort was at the bottom of it. It was unbearably cramped in the<br>kitchen, and dishes had to be put on the floor, and one had to be thinking<br>constantly about not stepping on them. The cook's vast buttocks banged<br>against me as she moved to and fro. A ceaseless, nagging chorus of orders<br>streamed from her:<br><br>'Unspeakable idiot! How many times have I told you not to bleed the<br>beetroots? Quick, let me get to the sink! Put those knives away; get on<br>with the potatoes. What have you done with my strainer? Oh, leave those<br>potatoes alone. Didn't I tell you to skim the BOUILLON? Take that can of<br>water off the stove. Never mind the washing up, chop this celery. No, not<br>like that, you fool, like this. There! Look at you letting those peas boil<br>over! Now get to work and scale these herrings. Look, do you call this<br>plate clean? Wipe it on your apron. Put that salad on the floor. That's<br>right, put it where I'm bound to step in it! Look out, that pot's boiling<br>over! Get me down that saucepan. No, the other one. Put this on the grill.<br>Throw those potatoes away. Don't waste time, throw them on the floor. Tread<br>them in. Now throw down some sawdust; this Hoor's like a skating-rink.<br>Look, you fool, that steak's burning! MON DIEU, why did they send me an<br>idiot for a PLONGEUR? Who are you talking to? Do you realize that my aunt<br>was a Russian countess?' etc. etc. etc.<br><br>This went on till three o'clock without much variation, except that<br>about eleven the cook usually had a CRISE DE NERFS and a flood of tears.<br>From three to five was a fairly slack time for the waiters, but the cook<br>was still busy, and I was working my fastest, for there was a pile of dirty<br>plates waiting, and it was a race to get them done, or partly done, before<br>dinner began. The washing up was doubled by the primitive conditions--a<br>cramped draining-board, tepid water, sodden cloths, and a sink that got<br>blocked once in an hour. By five the cook and I were feeling unsteady on<br>our feet, not having eaten or sat down since seven. We used to collapse,<br>she on the dustbin and I on the floor, drink a bottle of beer, and<br>apologize for some of the things we had said in the morning. Tea was what<br>kept us going. We took care to have a pot always stewing, and drank pints<br>during the day.<br><br>At half-past five the hurry and quarrelling began again, and now worse<br>than before, because everyone was tired out. The cook had a CRISE DE NERFS<br>at six and another at nine; they came on so regularly that one could have<br>told the time by them. She would flop down on the dustbin, begin weeping<br>hysterically, and cry out that never, no, never had she thought to come to<br>such a life as this; her nerves would not stand it; she had studied music<br>at Vienna; she had a bedridden husband to support, etc. etc. At another<br>time one would have been sorry for her, but, tired as we all were, her<br>whimpering voice merely infuriated us. Jules used to stand in the doorway<br>and mimic her weeping. The PATRON'S wife nagged, and Boris and Jules<br>quarrelled all day, because Jules shirked his work, and Boris, as head<br>waiter, claimed the larger share of the tips. Only the second day after the<br>restaurant opened, they came to blows in the kitchen over a two-franc tip,<br>and the cook and I had to separate them. The only person who never forgot<br>Us manners was the PATRON. He kept the same hours as the rest of us, but he<br>had no work to do, for it was his wife who really managed things. His sole<br>job, besides ordering the supplies, was to stand in the bar smoking<br>cigarettes and looking gentlemanly, and he did that to perfection.<br><br>The cook and I generally found time to eat our dinner between ten and<br>eleven o'clock. At midnight the cook would steal a packet of food for her<br>husband, stow it under her clothes, and make off, whimpering that these<br>hours would kill her and she would give notice in the morning. Jules also<br>left at midnight, usually after a dispute with Boris, who had to look after<br>the bar till two. Between twelve and half past I did what I could to finish<br>the washing up. There was no time to attempt doing the work properly, and I<br>used simply to rub the grease off the plates with table-napkins. As for the<br>dirt on the floor, I let it lie, or swept the worst of it out of sight<br>under the stoves.<br><br>At half past twelve I would put on my coat and hurry out. The PATRON,<br>bland as ever, would stop me as I went down the alley-way past the bar.<br>'MAIS, MON CHER MONSIEUR, how tired you look! Please do me the favour of<br>accepting this glass of brandy.'<br><br>He would hand me the glass of brandy as courteously as though I had<br>been a Russian duke instead of a PLONGEUR. He treated all of us like this.<br>It was our compensation for working seventeen hours a day.<br><br>As a rule the last Metro was almost empty--a great advantage, for<br>one could sit down and sleep for a quarter of an hour. Generally I was in<br>bed by half past one. Sometimes I missed the train and had to sleep on the<br>floor of the restaurant, but it hardly mattered, for I could have slept on<br>cobblestones at that time.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/18.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/20.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
