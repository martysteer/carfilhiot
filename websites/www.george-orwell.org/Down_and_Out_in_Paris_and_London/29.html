<h2>Chapter XXX</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>The next morning we began looking once more for Paddy's friend, who<br>was called Bozo, and was a screever--that is, a pavement artist.<br>Addresses did not exist in Paddy's world, but he had a vague idea that Bozo<br>might be found in Lambeth, and in the end we ran across him on the<br>Embankment, where he had established himself not far from Waterloo Bridge.<br>He was kneeling on the pavement with a box of chalks, copying a sketch of<br>Winston Churchill from a penny note-book. The likeness was not at all bad.<br>Bozo was a small, dark, hook-nosed man, with curly hair growing low on his<br>head. His right leg was dreadfully deformed, the foot being twisted heel<br>forward in a way horrible to see. From his appearance one could have taken<br>him for a Jew, but he used to deny this vigorously. He spoke of his<br>hooknose as 'Roman', and was proud of his resemblance to some Roman Emperor<br>--it was Vespasian, I think.<br><br>Bozo had a strange way of talking, Cockneyfied and yet very lucid and<br>expressive. It was as though he had read good books but had never troubled<br>to correct Us grammar. For a while Paddy and I stayed on the Embankment,<br>talking, and Bozo gave us an account of the screeving trade. I repeat what<br>he said more or less in his own words.<br><br>'I'm what they call a serious screever. I don't draw in blackboard<br>chalks like these others, I use proper colours the same as what painters<br>use; bloody expensive they are, especially the reds. I use five bobs' worth<br>of colours in a long day, and never less than two bobs' worth*. Cartoons<br>is my line--you know, politics and cricket and that. Look here'--he<br>showed me his notebook--'here's likenesses of all the political blokes,<br>what I've copied from the papers. I have a different cartoon every day. For<br>instance, when the Budget was on I had one of Winston trying to push an<br>elephant marked "Debt", and underneath I wrote, "Will he budge it?" See?<br>You can have cartoons about any of the parties, but you mustn't put<br>anything in favour of Socialism, because the police won't stand it. Once I<br>did a cartoon of a boa constrictor marked Capital swallowing a rabbit<br>marked Labour. The copper came along and saw it, and he says, "You rub that<br>out, and look sharp about it," he says. I had to rub it out. The copper's<br>got the right to move you on for loitering, and it's no good giving them a<br>back answer.'<br><br>[* Pavement artists buy their colours in the form of powder,<br>and work them into cakes in condensed milk]<br><br>I asked Bozo what one could earn at screeving. He said:<br><br>'This time of year, when it don't rain, I take about three quid<br>between Friday and Sunday--people get their wages Fridays, you see. I<br>can't work when it rains; the colours get washed off straight away. Take<br>the year round, I make about a pound a week, because you can't do much in<br>the winter. Boat Race day, and Cup Final day, I've took as much as four<br>pounds. But you have to CUT it out of them, you know; you don't take a bob<br>if you just sit and look at them. A halfpenny's the usual drop [gift], and<br>you don't get even that unless you give them a bit of backchat. Once<br>they've answered you they feel ashamed not to give you a drop. The best<br>thing's to keep changing your picture, because when they see you drawing<br>they'll stop and watch you. The trouble is, the beggars scatter as soon as<br>you turn round with the hat. You really want a nobber [assistant] at this<br>game. You keep at work and get a crowd watching you, and the nobber comes<br>casual-like round the back of them. They don't know he's the nobber. Then<br>suddenly he pulls his cap off, and you got them between two fires like.<br>You'll never get a drop off real toffs. It's shabby sort of blokes you get<br>most off, and foreigners. I've had even sixpences off Japs, and blackies,<br>and that. They're not so bloody mean as what an Englishman is. Another<br>thing to remember is to keep your money covered up, except perhaps a penny<br>in the hat. People won't give you anything if they see you got a bob or two<br>already.'<br><br>Bozo had the deepest contempt for the other screevers on the<br>Embankment. He called them 'the salmon platers'. At that time there was a<br>screever almost every twenty-five yards along the Embankment--twenty-five<br>yards being the recognized minimum between pitches. Bozo contemptuously<br>pointed out an old white-bearded screever fifty yards away.<br><br>'You see that silly old fool? He's bin doing the same picture every<br>day for ten years. "A faithful friend" he calls it. It's of a dog pulling a<br>child out of the water. The silly old bastard can't draw any better than a<br>child of ten. He's learned just that one picture by rule of thumb, like you<br>leam to put a puzzle together. There's a lot of that sort about here. They<br>come pinching my ideas sometimes; but I don't care; the silly--s can't<br>think of anything for themselves, so I'm always ahead of them. The whole<br>thing with cartoons is being up to date. Once a child got its head stuck in<br>the railings of Chelsea Bridge. Well, I heard about it, and my cartoon was<br>on the pavement before they'd got the child's head out of the railings.<br>Prompt, I am.'<br><br>Bozo seemed an interesting man, and I was anxious to see more of him.<br>That evening I went down to the Embankment to meet him, as he had arranged<br>to take Paddy and myself to a lodging-house south of the river. Bozo washed<br>his pictures off the pavement and counted his takings--it was about<br>sixteen shillings, of which he said twelve or thirteen would be profit. We<br>walked down into Lambeth. Bozo limped slowly, with a queer crablike gait,<br>half sideways, dragging his smashed foot behind him. He carried a stick in<br>each hand and slung his box of colours over his shoulder. As we were<br>crossing the bridge he stopped in one of the alcoves to rest. He fell<br>silent for a minute or two, and to my surprise I saw that he was looking at<br>the stars. He touched my arm and pointed to the sky with his stick.<br><br>'Say, will you look at Aldebaran! Look at the colour. Like a--great<br>blood orange!'<br><br>From the way he spoke he might have been an art critic in a picture<br>gallery. I was astonished. I confessed that I did not know which Aldebaran<br>was--indeed, I had never even noticed that the stars were of different<br>colours. Bozo began to give me some elementary hints on astronomy, pointing<br>out-the chief constellations. He seemed concerned at my ignorance. I said<br>to him, surprised:<br><br>'You seem to know a lot about stars.'<br><br>'Not a great lot. I know a bit, though. I got two letters from the<br>Astronomer Royal thanking me for writing about meteors. Now and again I go<br>out at night and watch for meteors. The stars are a free show; it don't<br>cost anything to use your eyes.'<br><br>'What a good idea! I should never have thought of it.'<br><br>'Well, you got to take an interest in something. It don't follow that<br>because a man's on the road he can't think of anything but<br>tea-and-two-slices.'<br><br>'But isn't it very hard to take an interest in things--things like<br>stars--living this life?'<br><br>'Screeving, you mean? Not necessarily. It don't need turn you into a<br>bloody rabbit--that is, not if you set your mind to it.'<br><br>'It seems to have that effect on most people.'<br><br>'Of course. Look at Paddy--a tea-swilling old moocher, only fit to<br>scrounge for fag-ends. That's the way most of them go. I despise them. But<br>you don't NEED to get like that. If you've got any education, it don't<br>matter to you if you're on the road for the rest of your life.'<br><br>'Well, I've found just the contrary,' I said. 'It seems to me that<br>when you take a man's money away he's fit for nothing from that moment.'<br><br>'No, not necessarily. If you set yourself to it, you can live the same<br>life, rich or poor. You can still keep on with your books and your ideas.<br>You just got to say to yourself, "I'm a free man in HERE"'--he tapped his<br>forehead--'and you're all right.'<br><br>Bozo talked further in the same strain, and I listened with attention.<br>He seemed a very unusual screever, and he was, moreover, the first person I<br>had heard maintain that poverty did not matter. I saw a good deal of him<br>during the next few days, for several times it rained and he could not<br>work. He told me the history of his life, and it was a curious one.<br><br>The son of a bankrupt bookseller, he had gone to work as a<br>house-painter at eighteen, and then served three years in France and India<br>during the war. After the war he had found a house-painting job in Paris,<br>and had stayed there several years. France suited him better than England<br>(he despised the English), and he had been doing well in Paris, saving<br>money, and engaged to a French girl. One day the girl was crushed to death<br>under the wheels of an omnibus. Bozo went on the drink for a week, and then<br>returned to work, rather shaky; the same morning he fell from a stage on<br>which he was working, forty feet on to the pavement, and smashed his right<br>foot to pulp. For some reason he received only sixty pounds compensation.<br>He returned to England, spent his money in looking for jobs, tried hawking<br>books in Middlesex Street market, then tried selling toys from a tray, and<br>finally settled down as a screever. He had lived hand to mouth ever since,<br>half starved throughout the winter, and often sleeping in the spike or on<br>the Embankment.<br><br>When I knew him he owned nothing but the clothes he stood up in, and<br>his drawing materials and a few books. The clothes were the usual beggar's<br>rags, but he wore a collar and tie, of which he was rather proud. The<br>collar, a year or more old, was constantly 'going' round the neck, and Bozo<br>used to patch it with bits cut from the tail of his shirt so that the shirt<br>had scarcely any tail left. His damaged leg was getting worse and would<br>probably have to be amputated, and his knees, from kneeling on the stones,<br>had pads of skin on them as thick as boot-soles. There was, clearly, no<br>future for him but beggary and a death in the workhouse.<br><br>With all this, he had neither fear, nor regret, nor shame, nor<br>self-pity. He had faced his position, and made a philosophy for himself.<br>Being a beggar, he said, was not his fault, and he refused either to have<br>any compunction about it or to let it trouble him. He was the enemy of<br>society, and quite ready to take to crime if he saw a good opportunity. He<br>refused on principle to be thrifty. In the summer he saved nothing,<br>spending his surplus earnings on drink, as he did not care about women. If<br>he was penniless when winter came on, then society must look after him. He<br>was ready to extract every penny he could from charity, provided that he<br>was not expected to say thank you for it. He avoided religious charities,<br>however, for he said it stuck in his throat to sing hymns for buns. He had<br>various other points of honour; for instance, it was his boast that never<br>in his life, even when starving, had he picked up a cigarette end. He<br>considered himself in a class above the ordinary run of beggars, who, he<br>said, were an abject lot, without even the decency to be ungrateful.<br><br>He spoke French passably, and had read some of Zola's novels, all<br>Shakespeare's plays, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, and a number of essays. He could<br>describe his adventures in words that one remembered. For instance,<br>speaking of funerals, he said to me:<br><br>'Have you-ever seen a corpse burned? I have, in India. They put the<br>old chap on the fire, and the next moment I almost jumped out of my skin,<br>because he'd started kicking. It was only his muscles contracting in the<br>heat--still, it give me a turn. Well, he wriggled about for a bit like a<br>kipper on hot coals, and then his belly blew up and went off with a bang<br>you could have heard fifty yards away. It fair put me against cremation.'<br><br>Or, again, apropos of his accident:<br><br>'The doctor says to me, "You fell on one foot, my man. And bloody<br>lucky for you you didn't fall on both feet," he says. "Because if you had<br>of fallen on both feet you'd have shut up like a bloody concertina, and<br>your thigh bones'd be sticking out of your ears!"'<br><br>Clearly the phrase was not the doctor's but Bozo's own. He had a gift<br>for phrases. He had managed to keep his brain intact and alert, and so<br>nothing could make him succumb to poverty. He might be ragged and cold, or<br>even starving, but so long as he could read, think, and watch for meteors,<br>he was, as he said, free in his own mind.<br><br>He was an embittered atheist (the sort of atheist who does not so much<br>disbelieve in God as personally dislike Him), and took a sort of pleasure<br>in thinking that human affairs would never improve. Sometimes, he said,<br>when sleeping on the Embankment, it had consoled him to look up at Mars or<br>Jupiter and think that there were probably Embankment sleepers there. He<br>had a curious theory about this. Life on earth, he said, is harsh because<br>the planet is poor in the necessities of existence. Mars, with its cold<br>climate and scanty water, must be far poorer, and life correspondingly<br>harsher. Whereas on earth you are merely imprisoned for stealing sixpence,<br>on Mars you are probably boiled alive. This thought cheered Bozo, I do not<br>know why. He was a very exceptional man.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/28.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/30.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
