<h2>Chapter XXIX</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>On the way to Edbury I told Paddy that I had a friend from whom I<br>could be sure of getting money, and suggested going straight into London<br>rather than face another night in the spike. But Paddy had not been in<br>Edbury spike recently, and, tramp-like, he would not waste a night's free<br>lodging. We arranged to go into London the next morning. I had only a<br>halfpenny, but Paddy had two shillings, which would get us a bed each and a<br>few cups of tea.<br><br>The Edbury spike did not differ much from the one at Romton. The worst<br>feature was that all tobacco was confiscated at the gate, and we were<br>warned that any man caught smoking would be turned out at once. Under the<br>Vagrancy Act tramps can be prosecuted for smoking in the spike--in fact,<br>they can be prosecuted for almost anything; but the authorities generally<br>save the trouble of a prosecution by turning disobedient men out of doors.<br>There was no work to do, and the cells were fairly comfortable. We slept<br>two in a cell, 'one up, one down'--that is, one on a wooden shelf and one<br>on the floor, with straw palliasses and plenty of blankets, dirty but not<br>verminous. The food was the same as at Romton, except that we had tea<br>instead of cocoa. One could get extra tea in the morning, as the Tramp<br>Major was selling it at a halfpenny a mug, illicitly no doubt. We were each<br>given a hunk of bread and cheese to take away for our midday meal.<br><br>When we got into London we had eight hours to kill before the<br>lodging-houses opened. It is curious how one does not notice things. I had<br>been in London innumerable times, and yet till that day I had never noticed<br>one of the worst things about London--the fact that it costs money even<br>to sit down. In Paris, if you had no money and could not find a public<br>bench, you would sit on the pavement. Heaven knows what sitting on the<br>pavement would lead to in London--prison, probably. By four we had stood<br>five hours, and our feet seemed red-hot from the hardness of the stones. We<br>were hungry, having eaten our ration as soon as we left the spike, and I<br>was out of tobacco--it mattered less to Paddy, who picked up cigarette<br>ends. We tried two churches and found them locked. Then we tried a public<br>library, but there were no seats in it. As a last hope Paddy suggested<br>trying a Rowton House; by the rules they would not let us in before seven,<br>but we might slip in unnoticed. We walked up to the magnificent doorway<br>(the Rowton Houses really are magnificent) and very casually, trying to<br>look like regular lodgers, began to stroll in. Instantly a man lounging in<br>the doorway, a sharp-faced fellow, evidently in some position of authority,<br>barred the way.<br><br>'You men sleep 'ere last night?'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'Then--off.'<br><br>We obeyed, and stood two more hours on the street corner. It was<br>unpleasant, but it taught me not to use the expression 'street corner<br>loafer', so I gained something from it.<br><br>At six we went to a Salvation Army shelter. We could not book beds<br>till eight and it was not certain that there would be any vacant, but an<br>official, who called us 'Brother', let us in on the condition that we paid<br>for two cups of tea. The main hall of the shelter was a great white-washed<br>barn of a place, oppressively clean and bare, with no fires. Two hundred<br>decentish, rather subdued-looking people were sitting packed on long wooden<br>benches. One or two officers in uniform prowled up and down. On the wall<br>were pictures of General Booth, and notices prohibiting cooking, drinking,<br>spitting, swearing, quarrelling, and gambling. As a specimen of these<br>notices, here is one that I copied word for word:<br><br><br>Any man found gambling or playing cards will be expelled and<br>will not be admitted under any circumstances.<br><br>A reward will be given for information leading to the discovery<br>of such persons.<br><br>The officers in charge appeal to all lodgers to assist them in<br>keeping this hostel free from the DETESTABLE EVIL OF GAMBLING.<br><br><br>'Gambling or playing cards' is a delightful phrase. To my eye these<br>Salvation Army shelters, though clean, are far drearier than the worst of<br>the common lodging-houses. There is such a hopelessness about some of the<br>people there--decent, broken-down types who have pawned their collars but<br>are still trying for office jobs. Coming to a Salvation Army shelter, where<br>it is at least clean, is their last clutch at respectability. At the next<br>table to me were two foreigners, dressed in rags but manifestly gentlemen.<br>They were playing chess verbally, not even writing down the moves. One of<br>them was blind, and I heard them say that they had been saving up for a<br>long time to buy a board, price half a crown, but could never manage it.<br>Here and there were clerks out of work, pallid and moody. Among a group of<br>them a tall, thin, deadly pale young man was talking excitedly. He thumped<br>his fist on the table and boasted in a strange, feverish style. When the<br>officers were out of hearing he broke out into startling blasphemies:<br><br>'I tell you what, boys, I'm going to get that job tomorrow. I'm not<br>one of your bloody down-on-the-knee brigade; I can look after myself. Look<br>at that--notice there! "The Lord will provide!" A bloody lot He's ever<br>provided me with. You don't catch me trusting to the--Lord. You leave it<br>to me, boys. I'M GOING TO GET THAT JOB,' etc. etc.<br><br>I watched him, struck by the wild, agitated way in which he talked; he<br>seemed hysterical, or perhaps a little drunk. An hour later I went into a<br>small room, apart from the main hall, which was intended for reading. It<br>had no books or papers in it, so few of the lodgers went there. As I opened<br>the door I saw the young clerk in there all alone; he was on his knees,<br>PRAYING. Before I shut the door again I had time to see his face, and it<br>looked agonized. Quite suddenly I realized, from the expression of his<br>face, that he was starving.<br><br>The charge for beds was eightpence. Paddy and I had fivepence left,<br>and we spent it at the 'bar', where food was cheap, though not so cheap as<br>in some common lodging-houses. The tea appeared to be made with tea DUST,<br>which I fancy had been given to the Salvation Army in charity, though they<br>sold it at threehalfpence a cup. It was foul stuff. At ten o'clock an<br>officer marched round the hall blowing a whistle. Immediately everyone<br>stood up.<br><br>'What's this for?' I said to Paddy, astonished.<br><br>'Dat means you has to go off to bed. An' you has to look sharp about<br>it, too.'<br><br>Obediently as sheep, the whole two hundred men trooped off to bed,<br>under the command of the officers.<br><br>The dormitory was a great attic like a barrack room, with sixty or<br>seventy beds in it. They were clean and tolerably comfortable, but very<br>narrow and very close together, so that one breathed straight into one's<br>neighbour's face. Two officers slept in the room, to see that there was no<br>smoking and no talking after lights-out. Paddy and I had scarcely a wink of<br>sleep, for there was a man near us who had some nervous trouble, shellshock<br>perhaps, which made him cry out 'Pip!' at irregular intervals. It was a<br>loud, startling noise, something like the toot of a small motor-horn. You<br>never knew when it was coming, and it was a sure preventer of sleep. It<br>appeared that Pip, as the others called him, slept regularly in the<br>shelter, and he must have kept ten or twenty people awake every night. He<br>was an example of the kind of thing that prevents one from ever getting<br>enough sleep when men are herded as they are in these lodging-houses.<br><br>At seven another whistle blew, and the officers went round shaking<br>those who did not get up at once. Since then I have slept in a number of<br>Salvation Army shelters, and found that, though the different houses vary a<br>little, this semi-military discipline is the same in all of them. They are<br>certainly cheap, but they are too like workhouses for my taste. In some of<br>them there is even a compulsory religious service once or twice a week,<br>which the lodgers must attend or leave the house. The fact is that the<br>Salvation Army are so in the habit of thinking themselves a charitable body<br>that they cannot even run a lodging-house without making it stink of<br>charity.<br><br>At ten I went to B.'s office and asked him to lend me a pound. He gave<br>me two pounds and told me to come again when necessary, so that Paddy and I<br>were free of money troubles for a week at least. We loitered the day in<br>Trafalgar Square, looking for a friend of Paddy's who never turned up, and<br>at night went to a lodging-house in a back alley near the Strand. The<br>charge was elevenpence, but it was a dark, evil-smelling place, and a<br>notorious haunt of the 'nancy boys'. Downstairs, in the murky kitchen,<br>three ambiguous-looking youths in smartish blue suits were sitting on a<br>bench apart, ignored by the other lodgers. I suppose they were 'nancy<br>boys'. They looked the same type as the apache boys one sees in Paris,<br>except that they wore no side-whiskers. In front of the fire a fully<br>dressed man and a stark-naked man were bargaining. They were newspaper<br>sellers. The dressed man was selling his clothes to the naked man. He said:<br><br>''Ere y'are, the best rig-out you ever 'ad. A tosheroon [half a crown]<br>for the coat, two 'ogs for the trousers, one and a tanner for the boots,<br>and a 'og for the cap and scarf. That's seven bob.'<br><br>'You got a 'ope! I'll give yer one and a tanner for the coat, a 'og<br>for the trousers, and two 'ogs for the rest. That's four and a tanner.'<br><br>'Take the 'ole lot for five and a tanner, chum.'<br><br>'Right y'are, off with 'em. I got to get out to sell my late edition.'<br><br>The clothed man stripped, and in three minutes their positions were<br>reversed; the naked man dressed, and the other kilted with a sheet of the<br>Daily Mail.<br><br>The dormitory was dark and close, with fifteen beds in it. There was a<br>horrible hot reek of urine, so beastly that at first one tried to breathe<br>in small, shallow puffs, not filling one's lungs to the bottom. As I lay<br>down in bed a man loomed out of the darkness, leant over me and began<br>babbling in an educated, half-drunken voice:<br><br>'An old public schoolboy, what? [He had heard me say something to<br>Paddy.] Don't meet many of the old school here. I am an old Etonian. You<br>know--twenty years hence this weather and all that.' He began to quaver<br>out the Eton boating-song, not untunefully:<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jolly boating weather,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a hay harvest--<br><br><br>'Stop that--noise!' shouted several lodgers.<br><br>'Low types,' said the old Etonian, 'very low types. Funny sort of<br>place for you and me, eh? Do you know what my friends say to me? They say,<br>"M--, you are past redemption." Quite true, I AM past redemption. I've come<br>down in the world; not like these--s here, who couldn't come down if they<br>tried. We chaps who have come down ought to hang together a bit. Youth will<br>be still in our faces--you know. May I offer you a drink?'<br><br>He produced a bottle of cherry brandy, and at the same moment lost his<br>balance and fell heavily across my legs. Paddy, who was undressing, pulled<br>him upright.<br><br>'Get back to yer bed, you silly ole--!'<br><br>The old Etonian walked unsteadily to his bed and crawled under the<br>sheets with all his clothes on, even his boots. Several times in the night<br>I heard him murmuring, 'M--, you are past redemption,' as though the phrase<br>appealed to him. In the morning he was lying asleep fully dressed, with the<br>bottle clasped in his arms. He was a man of about fifty, with a refined,<br>worn face, and, curiously enough, quite fashionably dressed. It was queer<br>to see his good patent-leather shoes sticking out of that filthy bed. It<br>occurred to me, too, that the cherry brandy must have cost the equivalent<br>of a fortnight's lodging, so he could not have been seriously hard up.<br>Perhaps he frequented common lodging-houses in search of the 'nancy boys'.<br><br>The beds were not more than two feet apart. About midnight I woke up<br>to find that the man next to me was trying to steal the money from beneath<br>my pillow. He was pretending to be asleep while he did it, sliding his hand<br>under the pillow as gently as a rat. In the morning I saw that he was a<br>hunchback, with long, apelike arms. I told Paddy about the attempted theft.<br>He laughed and said:<br><br>'Christ! You got to get used to dat. Desc lodgin' houses is full o'<br>thieves. In some houses dere's nothin' safe but to sleep wid all yer clo'es<br>on. I seen 'em steal a wooden leg off a cripple before now. Once I see a<br>man--fourteen-stone man he was--come into a lodgin'-house wid four<br>pound ten. He puts it under his mattress. "Now," he says, "any--dat<br>touches dat money does it over my body," he says. But dey done him all de<br>same. In de mornin' he woke up on de floor. Four fellers had took his<br>mattress by de corners an' lifted him off as light as a feather. He never<br>saw his four pound ten again.'<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/27.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/29.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
