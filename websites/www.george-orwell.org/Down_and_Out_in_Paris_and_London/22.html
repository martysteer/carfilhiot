<h2>Chapter XXIII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>As soon as I left the Auberge de Jehan Cottard I went to bed and slept<br>the clock round, all but one hour. Then I washed my teeth for the first<br>time in a fortnight, bathed and had my hair cut, and got my clothes out of<br>pawn. I had two glorious days of loafing. I even went in my best suit to<br>the Auberge, leant against the bar and spent five francs on a bottle of<br>English beer. It is a curious sensation, being a customer where you have<br>been a slave's slave. Boris was sorry that I had left the restaurant just<br>at the moment when we were LANCES and there was a chance of making money. I<br>have heard from him since, and he tells me that he is making a hundred<br>francs a day and has set up a girl who is TRES SERIEUSE and never smells of<br>garlic.<br><br>I spent a day wandering about our quarter, saying good-bye to<br>everyone. It was on this day that Charlie told me about the death of old<br>Roucolle the miser, who had once lived in the quarter. Very likely Charlie<br>was lying as usual, but it was a good story.<br><br>Roucolle died, aged seventy-four, a year or two before I went to<br>Paris, but the people in the quarter still talked of him while I was there.<br>He never equalled Daniel Dancer or anyone of that kind, but he was an<br>interesting character. He went to Les Halles every morning to pick up<br>damaged vegetables, and ate cat's meat, and wore newspaper instead of<br>underclothes, and used the wainscoting of his room for firewood, and made<br>himself a pair of trousers out of a sack--all this with half a million<br>francs invested. I should like very much to have known him.<br><br>Like many misers, Roucolle came to a bad end through putting his money<br>into a wildcat scheme. One day a Jew appeared in the quarter, an alert,<br>business-like young chap who had a first-rate plan for smuggling cocaine<br>into England. It is easy enough, of course, to buy cocaine in Paris, and<br>the smuggling would be quite simple in itself, only there is always some<br>spy who betrays the plan to the customs or the police. It is said that this<br>is often done by the very people who sell the cocaine, because the<br>smuggling trade is in the hands of a large combine, who do not want<br>competition. The Jew, however, swore that there was no danger. He knew a<br>way of getting cocaine direct from Vienna, not through the usual channels,<br>and there would be no blackmail to pay. He had got into touch with Roucolle<br>through a young Pole, a student at the Sorbonne, who was going to put four<br>thousand francs into the scheme if Roucolle would put six thousand. For<br>this they could buy ten pounds of cocaine, which would be worth a small<br>fortune in England.<br><br>The Pole and the Jew had a tremendous struggle to get the money from<br>between old Roucolle's claws. Six thousand francs was not much--he had<br>more than that sewn into the mattress in his room--but it was agony for<br>him to part with a sou. The Pole and the Jew were at him for weeks on end,<br>explaining, bullying, coaxing, arguing, going down on their knees and<br>imploring him to produce the money. The old man was half frantic between<br>greed and fear. His bowels yearned at the thought of getting, perhaps,<br>fifty thousand francs' profit, and yet he could not bring himself to risk<br>the money. He used to sit in a comer with his head in his hands, groaning<br>and sometimes yelling out in agony, and often he would kneel down (he was<br>very pious) and pray for strength, but still he couldn't do it. But at<br>last, more from exhaustion than anything else, he gave in quite suddenly;<br>he slit open the mattress where his money was concealed and handed over six<br>thousand francs to the Jew.<br><br>The Jew delivered the cocaine the same day, and promptly vanished. And<br>meanwhile, as was not surprising after the fuss Roucolle had made, the<br>affair had been noised all over the quarter. The very next morning the<br>hotel was raided and searched by the police.<br><br>Roucolle and the Pole were in agonies. The police were downstairs,<br>working their way up and searching every room in turn, and there was the<br>great packet of cocaine on the table, with no place to hide it and no<br>chance of escaping down the stairs. The Pole was for throwing the stuff out<br>of the window, but Roucolle would not hear of it. Charlie told me that he<br>had been present at the scene. He said that when they tried to take the<br>packet from Roucolle he clasped it to his breast and struggled like a<br>madman, although he was seventy-four years old. He was wild with fright,<br>but he would go to prison rather than throw his money away.<br><br>At last, when the police were searching only one floor below, somebody<br>had an idea. A man on Roucolle's floor had a dozen tins of face-powder<br>which he was selling on commission; it was suggested that the cocaine could<br>be put into the tins and passed off as face-powder. The powder was hastily<br>thrown out of the window and the cocaine substituted, and the tins were put<br>openly on Roucolle's table, as though there there were nothing to conceal.<br>A few minutes later the police came to search Roucolle's room. They tapped<br>the walls and looked up the chimney and turned out the drawers and examined<br>the floorboards, and then, just as they were about to give it up, having<br>found nothing, the inspector noticed the tins on the table.<br><br>'TIENS,' he said, 'have a look at those tins. I hadn't noticed them.<br>What's in them, eh?'<br><br>'Face-powder,' said the Pole as calmly as he could manage. But at the<br>same instant Roucolle let out a loud groaning noise, from alarm, and the<br>police became suspicious immediately. They opened one of the tins and<br>tipped out the contents, and after smelling it, the inspector said that he<br>believed it was cocaine. Roucolle and the Pole began swearing on the names<br>of the saints that it was only face-powder; but it was no use, the more<br>they protested the more suspicious the police became. The two men were<br>arrested and led off to the police station, followed by half the quarter.<br><br>At the station, Roucolle and the Pole were interrogated by the<br>Commissaire while a tin of the cocaine was sent away to be analysed.<br>Charlie said that the scene Roucolle made was beyond description. He wept,<br>prayed, made contradictory statements and denounced the Pole all at once,<br>so loud that he could be heard half a street away. The policemen almost<br>burst with laughing at him.<br><br>After an hour a policeman came back with the tin of cocaine and a note<br>from the analyst. He was laughing.<br><br>'This is not cocaine, MONSIEUR,' he said.<br><br>'What, not cocaine?' said the Commissaire. 'MAIS, ALORS--what is it,<br>then?'<br><br>'It is face-powder.'<br><br>Roucolle and the Pole were released at once, entirely exonerated but<br>very angry. The Jew had double-crossed them. Afterwards, when the<br>excitement was over, it turned out that he had played the same trick on two<br>other people in the quarter.<br><br>The Pole was glad enough to escape, even though he had lost his four<br>thousand francs, but poor old Roucolle was utterly broken down. He took to<br>his bed at once, and all that day and half the night they could hear him<br>thrashing about, mumbling, and sometimes yelling out at the top of his<br>voice:<br><br>'Six thousand francs! NOM DE JESUS-CHRIST! Six thousand francs!'<br><br>Three days later he had some kind of stroke, and in a fortnight he was<br>dead--of a broken heart, Charlie said.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/21.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/23.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
