<h2>Chapter XXVIII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>Paddy was my mate for about the next fortnight, and, as he was the<br>first tramp I had known at all well, I want to give an account of him. I<br>believe that he was a typical tramp and there are tens of thousands in<br>England like him.<br><br>He was a tallish man, aged about thirty-five, with fair hair going<br>grizzled and watery blue eyes. His features were good, but his cheeks had<br>lanked and had that greyish, dirty in the grain look that comes of a bread<br>and margarine diet. He was dressed, rather better than most tramps, in a<br>tweed shooting-jacket and a pair of old evening trousers with the braid<br>still on them. Evidently the braid figured in his mind as a lingering scrap<br>of respectability, and he took care to sew it on again when it came loose.<br>He was careful of his appearance altogether, and carried a razor and<br>bootbrush that he would not sell, though he had sold his 'papers' and even<br>his pocket-knife long since. Nevertheless, one would have known him for a<br>tramp a hundred yards away. There was something in his drifting style of<br>walk, and the way he had of hunching his shoulders forward, essentially<br>abject. Seeing him walk, you felt instinctively that he would sooner take a<br>blow than give one.<br><br>He had been brought up in Ireland, served two years in the war, and<br>then worked in a metal polish factory, where he had lost his job two years<br>earlier. He was horribly ashamed of being a tramp, but he had picked up all<br>a tramp's ways. He browsed the pavements unceasingly, never missing a<br>cigarette end, or even an empty cigarette packet, as he used the tissue<br>paper for rolling cigarettes. On our way into Edbury he saw a newspaper<br>parcel on the pavement, pounced on it, and found that it contained two<br>mutton sandwiches/rather frayed at the edges; these he insisted on my<br>sharing. He never passed an automatic machine without giving a tug at the<br>handle, for he said that sometimes they are out of order and will eject<br>pennies if you tug at them. He had no stomach for crime, however. When we<br>were in the outskirts of Romton, Paddy noticed a bottle of milk on a<br>doorstep, evidently left there by mistake. He stopped, eyeing the bottle<br>hungrily.<br><br>'Christ!' he said, 'dere's good food goin' to waste. Somebody could<br>knock dat bottle off, eh? Knock it off easy.'<br><br>I saw that he was thinking of 'knocking it off' himself. He looked up<br>and down the street; it was a quiet residential street and there was nobody<br>in sight. Paddy's sickly, chap-fallen face yearned over the milk. Then he<br>turned away, saying gloomily:<br><br>'Best leave it. It don't do a man no good to steal. T'ank God, I ain't<br>never stolen nothin' yet.'<br><br>It was funk, bred of hunger, that kept him virtuous. With only two or<br>three sound meals in his belly, he would have found courage to steal the<br>milk.<br><br>He had two subjects of conversation, the shame and come-down of being<br>a tramp, and the best way of getting a free meal. As we drifted through the<br>streets he would keep up a monologue in this style, in a whimpering,<br>self-pitying Irish voice:<br><br>'It's hell bein' on de road, eh? It breaks yer heart goin' into dem<br>bloody spikes. But what's a man to do else, eh? I ain't had a good meat<br>meal for about two months, an' me boots is getting bad, an'--Christ!<br>How'd it be if we was to try for a cup o' tay at one o' dem convents on de<br>way to Edbury? Most times dey're good for a cup o' tay. Ah, what'd a man do<br>widout religion, eh? I've took cups o' tay from de convents, an' de<br>Baptists, an' de Church of England, an' all sorts. I'm a Catholic meself.<br>Dat's to say, I ain't been to confession for about seventeen year, but<br>still I got me religious feelin's, y'understand. An' dem convents is always<br>good for a cup o' tay ...' etc. etc. He would keep this up all day, almost<br>without stopping.<br><br>His ignorance was limitless and appalling. He once asked me, for<br>instance, whether Napoleon lived before Jesus Christ or after. Another<br>time, when I was looking into a bookshop window, he grew very perturbed<br>because one of the books was called OF THE IMITATION OF CHRIST. He took<br>this for blasphemy. 'What de hell do dey want to go imitatin' of HIM for?'<br>he demanded angrily. He could read, but he had a kind of loathing for<br>books. On our way from Romton to Edbury I went into a public library, and,<br>though Paddy did not want to read, I suggested that he should come in and<br>rest his legs. But he preferred to wait on the pavement. 'No,' he said, 'de<br>sight of all dat bloody print makes me sick.'<br><br>Like most tramps, he was passionately mean about matches. He had a box<br>of matches when I met him, but I never saw him strike one, and he used to<br>lecture me for extravagance when I struck mine. His method was to cadge a<br>light from strangers, sometimes going without a smoke for half an hour<br>rather than strike a match.<br><br>Self-pity was the clue to his character. The thought of his bad luck<br>never seemed to leave him for an instant. He would break long silences to<br>exclaim, apropos of nothing, 'It's hell when yer clo'es begin to go up de<br>spout, eh?' or 'Dat tay in de spike ain't tay, it's piss,' as though there<br>was nothing else in the world to think about. And he had a low, worm-like<br>envy of anyone who was better off--not of the rich, for they were beyond<br>his social horizon, but of men in work. He pined for work as an artist<br>pines to be famous. If he saw an old man working he would say bitterly,<br>'Look at dat old--keepin' able-bodied men out o' work'; or if it was a<br>boy, 'It's dem young devils what's takin' de bread out of our mouths.' And<br>all foreigners to him were 'dem bloody dagoes'--for, according to his<br>theory, foreigners were responsible for unemployment.<br><br>He looked at women with a mixture of longing and hatred. Young, pretty<br>women were too much above him to enter into his ideas, but his mouth<br>watered at prostitutes. A couple of scarlet-lipped old creatures would go<br>past; Paddy's face would flush pale pink, and he would turn and stare<br>hungrily after the women. 'Tarts!' he would murmur, like a boy at a<br>sweetshop window. He told me once that he had not had to do with a woman<br>for two years--since he had lost his job, that is--and he had forgotten<br>that one could aim higher than prostitutes. He had the regular character of<br>a tramp--abject, envious, a jackal's character.<br><br>Nevertheless, he was a good fellow, generous by nature and capable of<br>sharing his last crust with a friend; indeed he did literally share his<br>last crust with me more than once. He was probably capable of work too, if<br>he had been well fed for a few months. But two years of bread and margarine<br>had lowered his standards hopelessly. He had lived on this filthy imitation<br>of food till his own mind and body were compounded of inferior stuff. It<br>was malnutrition and not any native vice that had destroyed his manhood.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/26.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/28.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
