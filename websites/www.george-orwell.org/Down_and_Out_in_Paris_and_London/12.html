<h2>Chapter XIII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>On my third day at the hotel the CHEF DU PERSONNEL, who had generally<br>spoken to me in quite a pleasant tone, called me up and said sharply:<br><br>'Here, you, shave that moustache off at once! NOM DE DIEU, who ever<br>heard of a PLONGEUR with a moustache?'<br><br>I began to protest, but he cut me short. 'A PLONGEUR with a moustache<br>--nonsense! Take care I don't see you with it tomorrow.'<br><br>On the way home I asked Boris what this meant. He shrugged his<br>shoulders. 'You must do what he says, MON AMI. No one in the hotel wears a<br>moustache, except the cooks. I should have thought you would have noticed<br>it. Reason? There is no reason. It is the custom.'<br><br>I saw that it was an etiquette, like not wearing a white tie with a<br>dinner-jacket, and shaved off my moustache. Afterwards I found out the<br>explanation of the custom, which is this: waiters in good hotels do not<br>wear moustaches, and to show their superiority they decree that PLONGEURS<br>shall not wear them either; and the cooks wear their moustaches to show<br>their contempt for the waiters.<br><br>This gives some idea of the elaborate caste system existing in a<br>hotel. Our staff, amounting to about a hundred and ten, had their prestige<br>graded as accurately as that of soldiers, and a cook or waiter was as much<br>above a PLONGEUR as a captain above a private. Highest of all came the<br>manager, who could sack anybody, even the cooks. We never saw the PATRON,<br>and all we knew of him was that his meals had to be prepared more carefully<br>than that of the customers; all the discipline of the hotel depended on the<br>manager. He was a conscientious man, and always on the lookout for<br>slackness, but we were too clever for him. A system of service bells ran<br>through the hotel, and the whole staff used these for signalling to one<br>another. A long ring and a short ring, followed by two more long rings,<br>meant that the manager was coming, and when we heard it we took care to<br>look busy.<br><br>Below the manager came the MAITRE D'HOTEL. He did not serve at table,<br>unless to a lord or someone of that kind, but directed the other waiters<br>and helped with the catering. His tips, and his bonus from the champagne<br>companies (it was two francs for each cork he returned to them), came to<br>two hundred francs a day. He was in a position quite apart from the rest of<br>the staff, and took his meals in a private room, with silver on the table<br>and two apprentices in clean white jackets to serve him. A little below the<br>head waiter came the head cook, drawing about five thousand francs a month;<br>he dined in the kitchen, but at a separate table, and one of the apprentice<br>cooks waited on him. Then came the CHEF DU PERSONNEL; he drew only fifteen<br>hundred francs a month, but he wore a black coat and did no manual work,<br>and he could sack PLONGEURS and fine waiters. Then came the other cooks,<br>drawing anything between three thousand and seven hundred and fifty ^<br>francs a month; then the waiters, making about seventy francs a day in<br>tips, besides a small retaining fee; then the laundresses and sewing women;<br>then the apprentice waiters, who received no tips, but were paid seven<br>hundred and fifty francs a month; then the PLONGEURS, also at seven hundred<br>and fifty francs; then the chambermaids, at five or six hundred francs a<br>month; and lastly the cafetiers, at five hundred a month. We of the<br>cafeterie were the very dregs of the hotel, despised and TUTOIED by<br>everyone.<br><br>There were various others--the office employees, called generally<br>couriers, the storekeeper, the cellarman, some porters and pages, the ice<br>man, the bakers, the night-watchman, the doorkeeper. Different jobs were<br>done by different races. The office employees and the cooks and<br>sewing-women were French, the waiters Italians and Germans (there is hardly<br>such a thing as a French waiter in Paris), the PLONGEURS of every race in<br>Europe, beside Arabs and Negroes. French was the lingua franca, even the<br>Italians speaking it to one another.<br><br>All the departments had their special perquisites. In all Paris hotels<br>it is the custom to sell the broken bread to bakers for eight sous a pound,<br>and the kitchen scraps to pigkeepers for a trifle, and to divide the<br>proceeds of this among the PLONGEURS. There was much pilfering, too. The<br>waiters all stole food--in fact, I seldom saw a waiter trouble to eat the<br>rations provided for him by the hotel--and the cooks did it on a larger<br>scale in the kitchen, and we in the cafeterie swilled illicit tea and<br>coffee. The cellarman stole brandy. By a rule of the hotel the waiters were<br>not allowed to keep stores of spirits, but had to go to the cellarman for<br>each drink as it was ordered. As the cellarman poured out the drinks he<br>would set aside perhaps a teaspoonful from each glass, and he amassed<br>quantities in this way. He would sell you the stolen brandy for five sous a<br>swig if he thought he could trust you.<br><br>There were thieves among the staff, and if you left money in your coat<br>pockets it was generally taken. The doorkeeper, who paid our wages and<br>searched us for stolen food, was the greatest thief in the hotel. Out of my<br>five hundred francs a month, this man actually managed to cheat me of a<br>hundred and fourteen francs in six weeks. I had asked to be paid daily, so<br>the doorkeeper paid me sixteen francs each evening, and, by not paying for<br>Sundays (for which of course payment was due), pocketed sixty-four francs.<br>Also, I sometimes worked on a Sunday, for which, though I did not know it,<br>I was entitled to an extra twenty-five francs. The doorkeeper never paid me<br>this either, and so made away with another seventy-five francs. I only<br>realized during my last week that I was being cheated, and, as I could<br>prove nothing, only twenty-five francs were refunded. The doorkeeper played<br>similar tricks on any employee who was fool enough to be taken in. He<br>called himself a Greek, but in reality he was an Armenian. After knowing<br>him I saw the force of the proverb 'Trust a snake before a Jew and a Jew<br>before a Greek, but don't trust an Armenian.'<br><br>There were queer characters among the waiters. One was a gentleman--<br>a youth who had been educated at a university, and had had a well-paid job<br>in a business office. He had caught a venereal disease, lost his job,<br>drifted, and now considered himself lucky to be a waiter. Many of the<br>waiters had slipped into France without passports, and one or two of them<br>were spies--it is a common profession for a spy to adopt. One day there<br>was a fearful row in the waiters' dining-room between Morandi, a<br>dangerous-looking man with eyes set too far apart, and another Italian. It<br>appeared that Morandi had taken the other man's mistress. The other man, a<br>weakling and obviously frightened of Morandi, was threatening vaguely.<br><br>Morandi jeered at him. 'Well, what are you going to do about it? I've<br>slept with your girl, slept with her three times. It was fine. What can you<br>do, eh?'<br><br>'I can denounce you to the secret police. You are an Italian spy.'<br><br>Morandi did not deny it. He simply produced a razor from his tail<br>pocket and made two swift strokes in the air, as though slashing a man's<br>cheeks open. Whereat the other waiter took it back.<br><br>The queerest type I ever saw in the hotel was an 'extra'. He had been<br>engaged at twenty-five francs for the day to replace the Magyar, who was<br>ill. He was a Serbian, a thick-set nimble fellow of about twenty-five,<br>speaking six languages, including English. He seemed to know all about<br>hotel work, and up till midday he worked like a slave. Then, as soon as it<br>had struck twelve, he turned sulky, shirked Us work, stole wine, and<br>finally crowned all by loafing about openly with a pipe in his mouth.<br>Smoking, of course, was forbidden under severe penalties. The manager<br>himself heard of it and came down to interview the Serbian, fuming with<br>rage.<br><br>'What the devil do you mean by smoking here?' he cried.<br><br>'What the devil do you mean by having a face like that?' answered the<br>Serbian, calmly.<br><br>I cannot convey the blasphemy of such a remark. The head cook, if a<br>PLONGEUR had spoken to him like that, would have thrown a saucepan of hot<br>soup in his face. The manager said instantly, 'You're sacked!' and at two<br>o'clock the Serbian was given his twenty-five francs and duly sacked.<br>Before he went out Boris asked him in Russian what game he was playing. He<br>said the Serbian answered:<br><br>'Look here, MON VIEUX, they've got to pay me a day's wages if I work<br>up to midday, haven't they? That's the law. And where's the sense of<br>working after I get my wages? So I'll tell you what I do. I go to a hotel<br>and get a job as an extra, and up to midday I work hard. Then, the moment<br>it's struck twelve, I start raising such hell that they've no choice but to<br>sack me. Neat, eh? Most days I'm sacked by half past twelve; today it was<br>two o'clock; but I don't care, I've saved four hours' work. The only<br>trouble is, one can't do it at the same hotel twice.'<br><br>It appeared that he had played this game at half the hotels and<br>restaurants in Paris. It is probably quite an easy game to play during the<br>summer, though the hotels protect themselves against it as well as they can<br>by means of a black list.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/11.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/13.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
