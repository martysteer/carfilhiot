<h2>Chapter IV</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>One day my English lessons ceased abruptly. The weather was getting<br>hot and one of my pupils, feeling too lazy to go on with his lessons,<br>dismissed me. The other disappeared from his lodgings without notice, owing<br>me twelve francs. I was left with only thirty centimes and no tobacco. For<br>a day and a half I had nothing to cat or smoke, and then, too hungry to put<br>it off any longer, I packed my remaining clothes into my suitcase and took<br>them to the pawnshop. This put an end to all pretence of being in funds,<br>for I could not take my clothes out of the hotel without asking Madame F.'s<br>leave. I remember, however, how surprised she was at my asking her instead<br>of removing the clothes on the sly, shooting the moon being a common trick<br>in our quarter.<br><br>It was the first time that I had been in a French pawnshop. One went<br>through grandiose stone portals (marked, of course, 'LIBERTE, EGATITE,<br>FRATERNITE' they write that even over the police stations in France) into a<br>large, bare room like a school classroom, with a counter and rows of<br>benches. Forty or fifty people were waiting. One handed one's pledge over<br>the counter and sat down. Presently, when the clerk had assessed its value<br>he would call out, 'NUMERO such and such, will you take fifty francs?'<br>Sometimes it was only fifteen francs, or ten, or five--whatever it was,<br>the whole room knew it. As I Came in the clerk called with an air of<br>offence, 'NUMERO 83--here!' and gave a little whistle and a beckon, as<br>though calling a dog. NUMERO 83 stepped to the counter; he was an old<br>bearded man, with an overcoat buttoned up at the neck and frayed<br>trouser-ends. Without a word the clerk shot the bundle across the counter<br>--evidently it was worth nothing. It fell to the ground and came open,<br>displaying four pairs of men's woollen pants. No one could help laughing.<br>Poor NUMERO 83 gathered up his pants and shambled out, muttering to<br>himself.<br><br>The clothes I was pawning, together with the suitcase, had cost over<br>twenty pounds, and were in good condition. I thought they must be worth ten<br>pounds, and a quarter of this (one expects quarter value at a pawnshop) was<br>two hundred and fifty or three hundred francs. I waited without anxiety,<br>expecting two hundred francs at the worst.<br><br>At last the clerk called my number: 'NUMERO 97!'<br><br>'Yes,' I said, standing up.<br><br>'Seventy francs?'<br><br>Seventy francs for ten pounds' worth of clothes! But it was no use<br>arguing; I had seen someone else attempt to argue, and the clerk had<br>instantly refused the pledge. I took the money and the pawnticket and<br>walked out. I had now no clothes except what I stood up in--the coat<br>badly out at the elbow--an overcoat, moderately pawnable, and one spare<br>shirt. Afterwards, when it was too late, I learned that it was wiser to go<br>to a pawnshop in the afternoon. The clerks are French, and, like most<br>French people, are in a bad temper till they have eaten their lunch.<br><br>When I got home, Madame F. was sweeping the BISTRO floor. She came up<br>the steps to meet me. I could see in her eye that she was uneasy about my<br>rent.<br><br>'Well,' she said, 'what did you get for your clothes? Not much, eh?'<br><br>'Two hundred francs,' I said promptly.<br><br>'TIENS!' she said, surprised; 'well, THAT'S not bad. How expensive<br>those English clothes must be!'<br><br>The lie saved a lot of trouble, and, strangely enough, it came true. A<br>few days later I did receive exactly two hundred francs due to me for a<br>newspaper article, and, though it hurt to do it, I at once paid every penny<br>of it in rent. So, though I came near to starving in the following weeks, I<br>was hardly ever without a roof.<br><br>It was now absolutely necessary to find work, and I remembered a<br>friend of mine, a Russian waiter named Boris, who might be able to help me.<br>I had first met him in the public ward of a hospital, where he was being<br>treated for arthritis in the left leg. He had told me to come to him if I<br>were ever in difficulties.<br><br>I must say something about Boris, for he was a curious character and<br>my close friend for a long time. He was a big, soldierly man of about<br>thirty-five, and had been good looking, but since his illness he had grown<br>immensely fat from lying in bed. Like most Russian refugees, he had had an<br>adventurous life. His parents, killed in the Revolution, had been rich<br>people, and he had served through the war in the Second Siberian Rifles,<br>which, according to him, was the best regiment in the Russian Army. After<br>the war he had first worked in a brush factory, then as a porter at Les<br>Halles, then had become a dishwasher, and had finally worked his way up to<br>be a waiter. When he fell ill he was at the Hotel Scribe, and taking a<br>hundred francs a day in tips. His ambition was to become a MAITRE D'HOTEL,<br>save fifty thousand francs, and set up a small, select restaurant on the<br>Right Bank.<br><br>Boris always talked of the war as the happiest time of his life. War<br>and soldiering were his passion; he had read innumerable books of strategy<br>and military history, and could tell you all about the theories of<br>Napoleon, Kutuzof, Clausewitz, Moltke and Foch. Anything to do with<br>soldiers pleased him. His favourite cafe was the Gloserie des Lilas in<br>Montparnasse, simply because the statue of Marshal Ney stands outside it.<br>Later on, Boris and I sometimes went to the rue du Commerce together. If we<br>went by Metro, Boris always got out at Cambronne station instead of<br>Commerce, though Commerce was nearer; he liked the association with General<br>Cambronne, who was called on to surrender at Waterloo, and answered simply,<br>'MERDE!'<br><br>The only things left to Boris by the Revolution were his medals and<br>some photographs of his old regiment; he had kept these when everything<br>else went to the pawnshop. Almost every day he would spread the photographs<br>out on the bed and talk about them:<br><br>'VOILA, MON AMI. There you see me at the head of my company. Fine big<br>men, eh? Not like these little rats of Frenchmen. A captain at twenty--<br>not bad, eh? Yes, a captain in the Second Siberian Rifles; and my father<br>was a colonel.<br><br>'AH, MAIS, MON AMI, the ups and downs of life! A captain in the<br>Russian Army, and then, piff! the Revolution--every penny gone. In 1916 I<br>stayed a week at the Hotel Edouard Sept; in 1920 I was trying for a job as<br>night watchman there. I have been night watchman, cellarman, floor<br>scrubber, dishwasher, porter, lavatory attendant. I have tipped waiters,<br>and I have been tipped by waiters.<br><br>'Ah, but I have known what it is to live like a gentleman, MON AMI. I<br>do not say it to boast, but the other day I was trying to compute how many<br>mistresses I have had in my life, and I made it out to be over two hundred.<br>Yes, at least two hundred... Ah, well, CA REVIENDRA. Victory is to him who<br>fights the longest. Courage!' etc. etc.<br><br>Boris had a queer, changeable nature. He always wished himself back in<br>the army, but he had also been a waiter long enough to acquire the waiter's<br>outlook. Though he had never saved more than a few thousand francs, he took<br>it for granted that in the end he would be able to set up his own<br>restaurant and grow rich. All waiters, I afterwards found, talk and think<br>of this; it is what reconciles them to being waiters. Boris used to talk<br>interestingly about Hotel life:<br><br>'Waiting is a gamble,' he used to say; 'you may die poor, you may make<br>your fortune in a year. You are not paid wages, you depend on tips--ten<br>per cent of the bill, and a commission from the wine companies on champagne<br>corks. Sometimes the tips are enormous. The barman at Maxim's, for<br>instance, makes five hundred francs a day. More than five hundred, in the<br>season... I have made two hundred francs a day myself. It was at a Hotel in<br>Biarritz, in the season. The whole staff, from the manager down to the<br>PLONGEURS, was working twenty-one hours a day. Twenty-one hours' work and<br>two and a half hours in bed, for a month on end. Still, it was worth it, at<br>two hundred francs a day.<br><br>'You never know when a stroke of luck is coming. Once when I was at<br>the Hotel Royal an American customer sent for me before dinner and ordered<br>twenty-four brandy cocktails. I brought them all together on a tray, in<br>twenty-four glasses. "Now, GUARCON," said the customer (he was drunk),<br>"I'll drink twelve and you'll drink twelve, and if you can walk to the door<br>afterwards you get a hundred francs." I walked to the door, and he gave me<br>a hundred francs. And every night for six days he did the same thing;<br>twelve brandy cocktails, then a hundred francs. A few months later I heard<br>he had been extradited by the American Government--embezzlement. There is<br>something fine, do you not think, about these Americans?'<br><br>I liked Boris, and we had interesting times together, playing chess<br>and talking about war and Hotels. Boris used often to suggest that I should<br>become a waiter. 'The life would suit you,' he used to say; 'when you are<br>in work, with a hundred francs a day and a nice mistress, it's not bad. You<br>say you go in for writing. Writing is bosh. There is only one way to make<br>money at writing, and that is to marry a publisher's daughter. But you<br>would make a good waiter if you shaved that moustache off. You are tall and<br>you speak English--those are the chief things a waiter needs. Wait till I<br>can bend this accursed leg, MON AMI. And then, if you are ever out of a<br>job, come to me.'<br><br>Now that I was short of my rent, and getting hungry, I remembered<br>Boris's promise, and decided to look him up at once. I did not hope to<br>become a waiter so easily as he had promised, but of course I knew how to<br>scrub dishes, and no doubt he could get me a job in the kitchen. He had<br>said that dishwashing jobs were to be had for the asking during the summer.<br>It was a great relief to remember that I had after all one influential<br>friend to fall back on.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/2.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/4.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
