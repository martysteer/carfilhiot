<h2>Chapter XXXV</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>Arrived at Lower Binfield, we sprawled for a long time on the green,<br>watched by cottagers from their front gates. A clergyman and his daughter<br>came and stared silently at us for a while, as though we had been aquarium<br>fishes, and then went away again. There were several dozen of us waiting.<br>William and Fred were there, still singing, and the men who had fought, and<br>Bill the moocher. He had been mooching from bakers, and had quantities of<br>stale bread tucked away between his coat and his bare body. He shared it<br>out, and we were all glad of it. There was a woman among us, the first<br>woman tramp I had ever seen. She was a fattish, battered, very dirty woman<br>of sixty, in a long, trailing black skirt. She put on great airs of<br>dignity, and if anyone sat down near her she sniffed and moved farther off.<br><br>'Where you bound for, missis?' one of the tramps called to her.<br><br>The woman sniffed and looked into the distance.<br><br>'Come on, missis,' he said, 'cheer up. Be chummy. We're all in the<br>same boat 'ere.'<br><br>'Thank you,' said the woman bitterly, 'when I want to get mixed up<br>with a set of TRAMPS, I'll let you know.'<br><br>I enjoyed the way she said TRAMPS. It seemed to show you in a flash<br>the whole other soul; a small, blinkered, feminine soul, that had learned<br>absolutely nothing from years on the road. She was, no doubt, a respectable<br>widow woman, become a tramp through some grotesque accident.<br><br>The spike opened at six. This was Saturday, and we were to be confined<br>over the week-end, which is the usual practice; why, I do not know, unless<br>it is from a vague feeling that Sunday merits something disagreeable. When<br>we registered I gave my trade as 'journalist'. It was truer than 'painter',<br>for I had sometimes earned money from newspaper articles, but it was a<br>silly thing to say, being bound to lead to questions. As soon as we were<br>inside the spike and had been lined up for the search, the Tramp Major<br>called my name. He was a stiff, soldierly man of forty, not looking the<br>bully he had been represented, but with an old soldier's gruffness. He said<br>sharply:<br><br>'Which of you is Blank?' (I forget what name I had given.)<br><br>'Me, sir.'<br><br>'So you are a journalist?'<br><br>'Yes, sir,' I said, quaking. A few questions would betray the fact<br>that I had been lying, which might mean prison. But the Tramp Major only<br>looked me up and down and said:<br><br>'Then you are a gentleman?'<br><br>'I suppose so.'<br><br>He gave me another long look. 'Well, that's bloody bad luck, guv'nor,'<br>he said; 'bloody bad luck that is.' And thereafter he treated me with<br>unfair favouritism, and even with a kind of deference. He did not search<br>me, and in the bathroom he actually gave me a clean towel to myself--an<br>unheard-of luxury. So powerful is the word 'gentleman' in an old soldier's<br>ear.<br><br>By seven we had wolfed our bread and tea and were in our cells. We<br>slept one in a cell, and there were bedsteads and straw palliasses, so that<br>one ought to have had a good night's sleep. But no spike is perfect, and<br>the peculiar shortcoming at Lower Binfield was the cold. The hot pipes were<br>not working, and the two blankets we had been given were thin cotton things<br>and almost useless. It was only autumn, but the cold was bitter. One spent<br>the long twelve-hour night in turning from side to side, falling asleep for<br>a few minutes and waking up shivering. We could not smoke, for our tobacco,<br>which we had managed to smuggle in, was in our clothes and we should not<br>get these back till the morning. All down the passage one could hear<br>groaning noises, and sometimes a shouted oath. No one, I imagine, got more<br>than an hour or two of sleep.<br><br>In the morning, after breakfast and the doctor's inspection, the Tramp<br>Major herded us all into the dining-room and locked the door upon us. It<br>was a limewashed, stone-floored room, unutterably dreary, with its<br>furniture of deal boards and benches, and its prison smell. The barred<br>windows were too high to look out of, and there were no ornaments save a<br>clock and a copy of the workhouse rules. Packed elbow to elbow on the<br>benches, we were bored already, though it was barely eight in the morning.<br>There was nothing to do, nothing to talk about, not even room to move. The<br>sole consolation was that one could smoke, for smoking was connived at so<br>long as one was not caught in the act. Scotty, a little hairy tramp with a<br>bastard accent sired by Cockney out of Glasgow, was tobaccoless, his tin of<br>cigarette ends having fallen out of his boot during the search and been<br>impounded. I stood him the makings of a cigarette. We smoked furtively,<br>thrusting our cigarettes into our pockets, like schoolboys, when we heard<br>the Tramp Major coming.<br><br>Most of the tramps spent ten continuous hours in this comfortless,<br>soulless room. Heaven knows how they put up with it. I was luckier than the<br>others, for at ten o'clock the Tramp Major told off a few men for odd jobs,<br>and he picked me out to help in the workhouse kitchen, the most coveted job<br>of all. This, like the clean towel, was a charm worked by the word<br>'gentleman'.<br><br>There was no work to do in the kitchen, and I sneaked off into a small<br>shed used for storing potatoes, where some workhouse paupers were skulking<br>to avoid the Sunday morning service. There were comfortable packing-cases<br>to sit on, and some back numbers of the FAMILY HERALD, and even a copy of<br>RAFFLES from the workhouse library. The paupers talked interestingly about<br>workhouse life. They told me, among other things, that the thing really<br>hated in the workhouse, as a stigma of charity, is the uniform; if the men<br>could wear their own clothes, or even their own caps and scarves, they<br>would not mind being paupers. I had my dinner from the workhouse table, and<br>it was a meal fit for a boa-constrictor--the largest meal I had eaten<br>since my first day at the Hotel X. The paupers said that they habitually<br>gorged to the bursting-point on Sunday and were underfed the rest of the<br>week. After dinner the cook set me to do the washing up, and told me to<br>throw away the food that remained. The wastage was astonishing and, in the<br>circumstances, appalling. Half-eateh joints of meat, and bucketfuls of<br>broken bread and vegetables, were pitched away like so much rubbish and<br>then defiled with tea-leaves. I filled five dustbins to overflowing with<br>quite eatable food. And while I did so fifty tramps were sitting in the<br>spike with their bellies half filled by the spike dinner of bread and<br>cheese, and perhaps two cold boiled potatoes each in honour of Sunday.<br>According to the paupers, the food was thrown away from deliberate policy,<br>rather than that it should be given to the tramps.<br><br>At three I went back to the spike. The tramps had been sitting there<br>since eight, with hardly room to move an elbow, and they were now half mad<br>with boredom. Even smoking was at an end, for a tramp's tobacco is<br>picked-up cigarette ends, and he starves if he is more than a few hours<br>away from the pavement. Most of the men were too bored even to talk; they<br>just sat packed on the benches, staring at nothing, their scrubby faces<br>split in two by enormous yawns. The room stank of ENNUI.<br><br>Paddy, his backside aching from the hard bench, was in a whimpering<br>mood, and to pass the time away I talked with a rather superior tramp, a<br>young carpenter who wore a collar and tie and was on the road, he said, for<br>lack of a set of tools. He kept a little aloof from the other tramps, and<br>held himself more like a free man than a casual. He had literary tastes,<br>too, and carried a copy of QUENTIN DURWARD in his pocket. He told me that<br>he never went into a spike unless driven there by hunger, sleeping under<br>hedges and behind ricks in preference. Along the south coast he had begged<br>by day and slept in bathing-huts for weeks at a time.<br><br>We talked of life on the road. He criticized the system that makes a<br>tramp spend fourteen hours a day in the spike, and the other ten in walking<br>and dodging the police. He spoke of his own case--six months at the<br>public charge for want of a few pounds' worth of tools. It was idiotic, he<br>said.<br><br>Then I told him about the wastage of food in the workhouse kitchen,<br>and what I thought of it. And at that he changed his tone instantly. I saw<br>that I had awakened the pew-renter who sleeps in every English workman.<br>Though he had been famished along with the others, he at once saw reasons<br>why the food should have been thrown away rather that given to the tramps.<br>He admonished me quite severely.<br><br>'They have to do it,' he said. 'If they made these places too<br>comfortable, you'd have all the scum of the country flocking into them.<br>It's only the bad food as keeps all that scum away. These here tramps are<br>too lazy to work, that's all that's wrong with them. You don't want to go<br>encouraging of them. They're scum.'<br><br>I produced arguments to prove him wrong, but he would not listen. He<br>kept repeating:<br><br>'You don't want to have any pity on these here tramps--scum, they<br>are. You don't want to judge them by the same standards as men like you and<br>me. They're scum, just scum.'<br><br>It was interesting to see the subtle way in which he disassociated<br>himself from 'these here tramps'. He had been on the road six months, but<br>in the sight of God, he seemed to imply, he was not a tramp. I imagine<br>there are quite a lot of tramps who thank God they are not tramps. They are<br>like the trippers who say such cutting things about trippers.<br><br>Three hours dragged by. At six supper arrived, and turned out to be<br>quite uneatable; the bread, tough enough in the morning (it had been cut<br>into slices on Saturday night), was now as hard as ship's biscuit. Luckily<br>it was spread with dripping, and we scraped the dripping off and ate that<br>alone, which was better than nothing. At a quarter past six we were sent to<br>bed. New tramps were arriving, and in order not to mix the tramps of<br>different days (for fear of infectious diseases) the new men were put in<br>the cells and we in dormitories. Our dormitory was a barn-like room with<br>thirty beds close together, and a tub to serve as a common chamber-pot. It<br>stank abominably, and the older men coughed and got up all night. But being<br>so many together kept the room warm, and we had some sleep.<br><br>We dispersed at ten in the morning, after a fresh medical inspection,<br>with a hunk of bread and cheese for our midday dinner. William and Fred,<br>strong in the possession of a shilling, impaled their bread on the spike<br>railings--as a protest, they said. This was the second spike in Kent that<br>they had made too hot to hold them, and they thought it a great joke. They<br>were cheerful souls, for tramps. The imbecile (there is an imbecile in<br>every collection of tramps) said that he was too tired to walk and clung to<br>the railings, until the Tramp Major had to dislodge him and start him with<br>a kick. Paddy and I turned north, for London. Most of the others were going<br>on to Ide Hill, said to be about the worst spike in England*.<br><br>[* I have been in it since, and it is not so bad]<br><br>Once again it was jolly autumn weather, and the road was quiet, with<br>few cars passing. The air was like sweet-briar after the spike's mingled<br>stenches of sweat, soap, and drains. We two seemed the only tramps on the<br>road. Then I heard a hurried step behind us, and someone calling. It was<br>little Scotty, the Glasgow tramp, who had run after us panting. He produced<br>a rusty tin from his pocket. He wore a friendly smile, like someone<br>repaying an obligation.<br><br>'Here y'are, mate,' he said cordially. 'I owe you some fag ends. You<br>stood me a smoke yesterday. The Tramp Major give me back my box of fag ends<br>when we come out this morning. One good turn deserves another--here<br>y'are.'<br><br>And he put four sodden, debauched, loathly cigarette ends into my<br>hand.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/33.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/35.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
