<h2>Chapter II</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>Life in the quarter. Our BISTRO, for instance, at the foot of the<br>Hotel des Trois Moineaux. A tiny brick-floored room, half underground, with<br>wine-sodden tables, and a photograph of a funeral inscribed 'CREDIT EST<br>MORT'; and red-sashed workmen carving sausage with big jack-knives; and<br>Madame F., a splendid Auvergnat peasant woman with the face of a<br>strong-minded cow, drinking Malaga all day 'for her stomach'; and games of<br>dice for APERITIFS; and songs about 'LES PRAISES ET LES FRAMBOISES', and<br>about Madelon, who said, 'COMMENT EPOUSER UN SOLDAT, MOI QUI AIME TOUT LE<br>REGIMENT?'; and extraordinarily public love-making. Half the hotel used to<br>meet in the BISTRO in the evenings. I wish one could find a pub in London a<br>quarter as cheery.<br><br>One heard queer conversations in the BISTRO. As a sample I give you<br>Charlie, one of the local curiosities, talking.<br><br>Charlie was a youth of family and education who had run away from home<br>and lived on occasional remittances. Picture him very pink and young, with<br>the fresh cheeks and soft brown hair of a nice little boy, and lips<br>excessively red and wet, like cherries. His feet are tiny, his arms<br>abnormally short, his hands dimpled like a baby's. He has a way of dancing<br>and capering while he talks, as though he were too happy and too full of<br>life to keep still for an instant. It is three in the afternoon, and there<br>is no one in the BISTRO except Madame F. and one or two men who are out of<br>work; but it is all the same to Charlie whom he talks to, so long as he<br>can talk about himself. He declaims like an orator on a barricade, rolling<br>the words on his tongue and gesticulating with his short arms. His small,<br>rather piggy eyes glitter with enthusiasm. He is, somehow, profoundly<br>disgusting to see.<br><br>He is talking of love, his favourite subject.<br><br>'AH, L'AMOUR, L'AMOUR! AH, QUE LES FEMMES M'ONT TUE! Alas, MESSIEURS<br>ET DAMES, women have been my ruin, beyond all hope my ruin. At twenty-two I<br>am utterly worn out and finished. But what things I have learned, what<br>abysses of wisdom have I not plumbed! How great a thing it is to have<br>acquired the true wisdom, to have become in the highest sense of the word a<br>civilized man, to have become RAFFINE, VICIEUX,' etc. etc.<br><br>'MESSIEURS ET DAFFIES, I perceive that you are sad. AH, MAIS LA VIE<br>EST BELLE--you must not be sad. Be more gay, I beseech you!<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fill high ze bowl vid Samian vine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ve vill not sink of semes like zese!<br><br><br>'AH, QUE LA VIE EST BELLE! LISTEN, MESSIEURS ET DAMES, out of the<br>fullness of my experience I will discourse to you of love. I will explain<br>to you what is the true meaning of love--what is the true sensibility,<br>the higher, more refined pleasure which is known to civilized men alone. I<br>will tell you of the happiest day of my life. Alas, but I am past the time<br>when I could know such happiness as that. It is gone for ever--the very<br>possibility, even the desire for it, are gone.<br><br>'Listen, then. It was two years ago; my brother was in Paris--he is<br>a lawyer--and my parents had told him to find me and take me out to<br>dinner. We hate each other, my brother and I, but we preferred not to<br>disobey my parents. We dined, and at dinner he grew very drunk upon three<br>bottles of Bordeaux. I took him back to his hotel, and on the way I bought<br>a bottle of brandy, and when we had arrived I made my brother drink a<br>tumblerful of it--I told him it was something to make him sober. He drank<br>it, and immediately he fell down like somebody in a fit, dead drunk. I<br>lifted him up and propped his back against the bed; then I went through his<br>pockets. I found eleven hundred francs, and with that I hurried down the<br>stairs, jumped into a taxi, and escaped. My brother did not know my address<br>--I was safe.<br><br>'Where does a man go when he has money? To the BORDELS, naturally. But<br>you do not suppose that I was going to waste my time on some vulgar<br>debauchery fit only for navvies? Confound it, one is a civilized man! I was<br>fastidious, exigeant, you understand, with a thousand francs in my pocket.<br>It was midnight before I found what I was looking for. I had fallen in with<br>a very smart youth of eighteen, dressed EN SMOKING and with his hair cut A<br>L'AMERICAINE, and we were talking in a quiet BISTRO away from the<br>boulevards. We understood one another well, that youth and I. We talked of<br>this and that, and discussed ways of diverting oneself. Presently we took a<br>taxi together and were driven away.<br><br>'The taxi stopped in a narrow, solitary street with a single gas-lamp<br>flaring at the end. There were dark puddles among the stones. Down one side<br>ran the high, blank wall of a convent. My guide led me to a tall, ruinous<br>house with shuttered windows, and knocked several times at the door.<br>Presently there was a sound of footsteps and a shooting of bolts, and the<br>door opened a little. A hand came round the edge of it; it was a large,<br>crooked hand, that held itself palm upwards under our noses, demanding<br>money.<br><br>'My guide put his foot between the door and the step. "How much do you<br>want?" he said.<br><br>'"A thousand francs," said a woman's voice. "Pay up at once or you<br>don't come in."<br><br>'I put a thousand francs into the hand and gave the remaining hundred<br>to my guide: he said good night and left me. I could hear the voice inside<br>counting the notes, and then a thin old crow of a woman in a black dress<br>put her nose out and regarded me suspiciously before letting me in. It was<br>very dark inside: I could see nothing except a flaring gas-jet that<br>illuminated a patch of plaster wall, throwing everything else into deeper<br>shadow. There was a smell of rats and dust. Without speaking, the old woman<br>lighted a candle at the gas-jet, then hobbled in front of me down a stone<br>passage to the top of a flight of stone steps.<br><br>'"VOILA!" she said; "go down into the cellar there and do what you<br>like. I shall see nothing, hear nothing, know nothing. You are free, you<br>understand--perfectly free."<br><br>'Ha, MESSIEURS, need I describe to YOU--FORCEMENT, you know it<br>yourselves--that shiver, half of terror and half of joy, that goes<br>through one at these moments? I crept down, feeling my way; I could hear my<br>breathing and the scraping of my shoes on the stones, otherwise all was<br>silence. At the bottom of the stairs my hand met an electric switch. I<br>turned it, and a great electrolier of twelve red globes flooded the cellar<br>with a red light. And behold, I was not in a cellar, but in a bedroom, a<br>great, rich, garish bedroom, coloured blood red from top to bottom. Figure<br>it to yourselves, MESSIEURS ET DAMES! Red carpet on the floor, red paper on<br>the walls, red plush on the chairs, even the ceiling red; everywhere red,<br>burning into the eyes. It was a heavy, stifling red, as though the light<br>were shining through bowls of blood. At the far end stood a huge, square<br>bed, with quilts red like the rest, and on it a girl was lying, dressed in<br>a frock of red velvet. At the sight of me she shrank away and tried to hide<br>her knees under the short dress.<br><br>'I had halted by the door. "Come here, my chicken," I called to her.<br><br>'She gave a whimper of fright. With a bound I was beside the bed; she<br>tried to elude me, but I seized her by the throat--like this, do you see?<br>--tight! She struggled, she began to cry out for mercy, but I held her<br>fast, forcing back her head and staring down into her face. She was twenty<br>years old, perhaps; her face was the broad, dull face of a stupid child,<br>but it was coated with paint and powder, and her blue, stupid eyes, shining<br>in the red light, wore that shocked, distorted look that one sees nowhere<br>save in the eyes of these women. She was some peasant girl, doubtless, whom<br>her parents had sold into slavery.<br><br>'Without another word I pulled her off the bed and threw her on to the<br>floor. And then I fell upon her like a tiger! Ah, the joy, the incomparable<br>rapture of that time! There, MESSIEURS ET DAMES, is what I would expound to<br>you; VOILA L'AMOUR! There is the true love, there is the only thing in the<br>world worth striving for; there is the thing beside which all your arts and<br>ideals, all your philosophies and creeds, all your fine words and high<br>attitudes, are as pale and profitless as ashes. When one has experienced<br>love--the true love--what is there in the world that seems more than a<br>mere ghost of joy?<br><br>'More and more savagely I renewed the attack. Again and again the girl<br>tried to escape; she cried out for mercy anew, but I laughed at her.<br><br>'"Mercy!" I said, "do you suppose I have come here to show mercy? Do<br>you suppose I have paid a thousand francs for that?" I swear to you,<br>MESSIEURS ET DAMES, that if it were not for that accursed law that robs us<br>of our liberty, I would have murdered her at that moment.<br><br>'Ah, how she screamed, with what bitter cries of agony. But there was<br>no one to hear them; down there under the streets of Paris we were as<br>secure as at the heart of a pyramid. Tears streamed down the girl's face,<br>washing away the powder in long, dirty smears. Ah, that irrecoverable time!<br>You, MESSIEURS ET DAMES, you who have not cultivated the finer<br>sensibilities of love, for you such pleasure is almost beyond conception.<br>And I too, now that my youth is gone--ah, youth!--shall never again see<br>life so beautiful as that. It is finished.<br><br>'Ah yes, it is gone--gone for ever. Ah, the poverty, the shortness,<br>the disappointment of human joy! For in reality--CAR EN REALITE, what is<br>the duration of the supreme moment of love. It is nothing, an instant, a<br>second perhaps. A second of ecstasy, and after that--dust, ashes,<br>nothingness.<br><br>'And so, just for one instant, I captured the supreme happiness, the<br>highest and most refined emotion to which human beings can attain. And in<br>the same moment it was finished, and I was left--to what? All my<br>savagery, my passion, were scattered like the petals of a rose. I was left<br>cold and languid, full of vain regrets; in my revulsion I even felt a kind<br>of pity for the weeping girl on the floor. Is it not nauseous, that we<br>should be the prey of such mean emotions? I did not look at the girl again;<br>my sole thought was to get away. I hastened up the steps of the vault and<br>out into the street. It was dark and bitterly cold, the streets were empty,<br>the stones echoed under my heels with a hollow, lonely ring. All my money<br>was gone, I had not even the price of a taxi fare. I walked back alone to<br>my cold, solitary room.<br><br>'But there, MESSIEURS ET DAMES, that is what I promised to expound to<br>you. That is Love. That was the happiest day of my life.'<br><br>He was a curious specimen, Charlie. I describe him, just to show what<br>diverse characters could be found flourishing in the Coq d'Or quarter.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/0.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/2.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
