<h2>Chapter XV</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>I heard queer tales in the hotel. There were tales of dope fiends, of<br>old debauchees who frequented hotels in search of pretty page boys, of<br>thefts and blackmail. Mario told me of a hotel in which he had been, where<br>a chambermaid stole a priceless diamond ring from an American lady. For<br>days the staff were searched as they left work, and two detectives searched<br>the hotel from top to bottom, but the ring was never found. The chambermaid<br>had a lover in the bakery, and he had baked the ring into a roll, where it<br>lay unsuspected until the search was over.<br><br>Once Valenti, at a slack time, told me a story about himself.<br><br>'You know, MON P'TIT, this hotel life is all very well, but it's the<br>devil when you're out of work. I expect you know what it is to go without<br>eating, eh? FORCEMENT, otherwise you wouldn't be scrubbing dishes. Well,<br>I'm not a poor devil of a PLONGEUR; I'm a waiter, and I went five days<br>without eating, once. Five days without even a crust of bread--Jesus<br>Christ!<br><br>'I tell you, those five days were the devil. The only good thing was,<br>I had my rent paid in advance. I was living in a dirty, cheap little hotel<br>in the Rue Sainte Eloise up in the Latin quarter. It was called the Hotel<br>Suzanne May, after some famous prostitute of the time of the Empire. I was<br>starving, and there was nothing I could do; I couldn't even go to the cafes<br>where the hotel proprietors come to engage waiters, because I hadn't the<br>price of a drink. All I could do was to lie in bed getting weaker and<br>weaker, and watching the bugs running about the ceiling. I don't want to go<br>through that again, I can tell you.<br><br>'In the afternoon of the fifth day I went half mad; at least, that's<br>how it seems to me now. There was an old faded print of a woman's head<br>hanging on the wall of my room, and I took to wondering who it could be;<br>and after about an hour I realized that it must be Sainte Eloise, who was<br>the PATRON saint of the quarter. I had never taken any notice of the thing<br>before, but now, as I lay staring at it, a most extraordinary idea came<br>into my head.<br><br>'"ECOUTE, MON CHER," I said to myself, "you'll be starving to death if<br>this goes on much longer. You've got to do something. Why not try a prayer<br>to Sainte Eloise? Go down on your knees and ask her to send you some money.<br>After all, it can't do any harm. Try it!"<br><br>'Mad, eh? Still, a man will do anything when he's hungry. Besides, as<br>I said, it couldn't do any harm. I got out of bed and began praying. I<br>said:<br><br>'"Dear Sainte Eloise, if you exist, please send me some money. I don't<br>ask for much--just enough to buy some bread and a bottle of wine and get<br>my strength back. Three or four francs would do. You don't know how<br>grateful I'll be, Sainte Eloise, if you help me this once. And be sure, if<br>you send me anything, the first thing I'll do will be to go and bum a<br>candle for you, at your church down the street. Amen."<br><br>'I put in that about the candle, because I had heard that saints like<br>having candles burnt in their honour. I meant to keep my promise, of<br>course. But I am an atheist and I didn't really believe that anything would<br>come of it.<br><br>'Well, I got into bed again, and five minutes later there came a bang<br>at the door. It was a girl called Maria, a big fat peasant girl who lived<br>at our hotel. She was a very stupid girl, but a good sort, and I didn't<br>much care for her to see me in the state I was in.<br><br>'She cried out at the sight of me. "NOM DE DIEU!" she said, "what's<br>the matter with you? What are you doing in bed at this time of day? QUELLE<br>MINE QUE TU AS! You look more like a corpse than a man."<br><br>'Probably I did look a sight. I had been five days without food, most<br>of the time in bed, and it was three days since I had had a wash or a<br>shave. The room was a regular pigsty, too.<br><br>'"What's the matter?" said Maria again.<br><br>'"The matter!" I said; "Jesus Christ! I'm starving. I haven't eaten<br>for five days. That's what's the matter."<br><br>'Maria was horrified. "Not eaten for five days?" she said. "But why?<br>Haven't you any money, then?"<br><br>'"Money!" I said. "Do you suppose I should be starving if I had money?<br>I've got just five sous in the world, and I've pawned everything. Look<br>round the room and see if there's anything more I can sell or pawn. If you<br>can find anything that will fetch fifty centimes, you're cleverer than I<br>am."<br><br>'Maria began looking round the room. She poked here and there among a<br>lot of rubbish that was lying about, and then suddenly she got quite<br>excited. Her great thick mouth fell open with astonishment.<br><br>'"You idiot!" she cried out. "Imbecile! What's THIS, then?"<br><br>'I saw that she had picked up an empty oil BIDON that had been lying<br>in the comer. I had bought it weeks before, for an oil lamp I had before I<br>sold my things.<br><br>"That?" I said. "That's an oil BIDON. What about it?"<br><br>'"Imbecile! Didn't you pay three francs fifty deposit on it?"<br><br>'Now, of course I had paid the three francs fifty. They always make<br>you pay a deposit on the BIDON, and you get it back when the BIDON is<br>returned. But I'd forgotten all about it.<br><br>'"Yes--" I began.<br><br>'"Idiot!" shouted Maria again. She got so excited that she began to<br>dance about until I thought her sabots would go through the floor, "Idiot!<br>T'ES FOU! T'ES FOU! What have you got to do but take it back to the shop<br>and get your deposit back? Starving, with three francs fifty staring you in<br>the face! Imbecile!"<br><br>'I can hardly believe now that in all those five days I had never once<br>thought of taking the BIDON back to the shop. As good as three francs fifty<br>in hard cash, and it had never occurred to me! I sat up in bed. "Quick!" I<br>shouted to Maria, "you take it for me. Take it to the grocer's at the<br>corner--run like the devil. And bring back food!"<br><br>'Maria didn't need to be told. She grabbed the BIDON and went<br>clattering down the stairs like a herd of elephants and in three minutes<br>she was back with two pounds of bread under one arm and a half-litre bottle<br>of wine under the other. I didn't stop to thank her; I just seized the<br>bread and sank my teeth in it. Have you noticed how bread tastes when you<br>have been hungry for a long time? Cold, wet, doughy--like putty almost.<br>But, Jesus Christ, how good it was! As for the wine, I sucked it all down<br>in one draught, and it seemed to go straight into my veins and flow round<br>my body like new blood. Ah, that made a difference!<br><br>'I wolfed the whole two pounds of bread without stopping to take<br>breath. Maria stood with her hands on her hips, watching me eat. "Well, you<br>feel better, eh?" she said when I had finished.<br><br>'"Better!" I said. "I feel perfect! I'm not the same man as I was five<br>minutes ago. There's only one thing in the world I need now--a<br>cigarette."<br><br>'Maria put her hand in her apron pocket. "You can't have it," she<br>said. "I've no money. This is all I had left out of your three francs fifty<br>--seven sous. It's no good; the cheapest cigarettes are twelve sous a<br>packet."<br><br>'"Then I can have them!" I said. "Jesus Christ, what a piece of luck!<br>I've got five sous--it's just enough."<br><br>'Maria took the twelve sous and was starting out to the tobacconist's.<br>And then something I had forgotten all this time came into my head. There<br>was that cursed Sainte Eloise! I had promised her a candle if she sent me<br>money; and really, who could say that the prayer hadn't come true? "Three<br>or four francs," I had said; and the next moment along came three francs<br>fifty. There was no getting away from it. I should have to spend my twelve<br>sous on a candle.<br><br>'I called Maria back. "It's no use," I said; "there is Sainte Eloise<br>--I have promised her a candle. The twelve sous will have to go on that.<br>Silly, isn't it? I can't have my cigarettes after all."<br><br>'"Sainte Eloise?" said Maria. "What about Sainte Eloise?"<br><br>'"I prayed to her for money and promised her a candle," I said. "She<br>answered the prayer--at any rate, the money turned up. I shall have to<br>buy that candle. It's a nuisance, but it seems to me I must keep my<br>promise."<br><br>'"But what put Sainte Eloise into your head?" said Maria.<br><br>'"It was her picture," I said, and I explained the whole thing. "There<br>she is, you see," I said, and I pointed to the picture on the wall.<br><br>'Maria looked at the picture, and then to my surprise she burst into<br>shouts of laughter. She laughed more and more, stamping about the room and<br>holding her fat sides as though they would burst. I thought she had gone<br>mad. It was two minutes before she could speak.<br><br>'"Idiot!" she cried at last. "T'ES FOU! T'ES FOU! Do you mean to tell<br>me you really knelt down and prayed to that picture? Who told you it was<br>Sainte Eloise?"<br><br>'"But I made sure it was Sainte Eloise!" I said.<br><br>'"Imbecile! It isn't Sainte Eloise at all. Who do you think it is?"<br><br>'"Who?" I said.<br><br>'"It is Suzanne May, the woman this hotel is called after."<br><br>'I had been praying to Suzanne May, the famous prostitute of the<br>Empire...<br><br>'But, after all, I wasn't sorry. Maria and I had a good laugh, and<br>then we talked it over, and we made out that I didn't owe Sainte Eloise<br>anything. Clearly it wasn't she who had answered the prayer, and there was<br>no need to buy her a candle. So I had my packet of cigarettes after all.'<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/13.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/15.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
