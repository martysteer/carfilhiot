<h2>Chapter XXXIV</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>The next morning, our money being at an end, Paddy and I set out for<br>the spike. We went southward by the Old Kent Road, making for Cromley; we<br>could not go to a London spike, for Paddy had been in one recently and did<br>not care to risk going again. It was a sixteen-mile walk over asphalt,<br>blistering to the heels, and we were acutely hungry. Paddy browsed the<br>pavement, laying up a store of cigarette ends against his time in the<br>spike. In the end his perseverance was rewarded, for he picked up a penny.<br>We bought a large piece of stale bread, and devoured it as we walked.<br><br>When we got to Cromley, it was too early to go to the spike, and we<br>walked several miles farther, to a plantation beside a meadow, where one<br>could sit down. It was a regular caravanserai of tramps--one could tell<br>it by the worn grass and the sodden newspaper and rusty cans that they had<br>left behind. Other tramps were arriving by ones and twos. It was jolly<br>autumn weather. Near by, a deep bed of tansies was growing; it seems to me<br>that even now I can smell the sharp reek of those tansies, warring with the<br>reek of tramps. In the meadow two carthorse colts, raw sienna colour with<br>white manes and tails, were nibbling at a gate. We. sprawled about on the<br>ground, sweaty and exhausted. Someone managed to find dry sticks and get a<br>fire going, and we all had milkless tea out of a tin 'drum' which was<br>passed round.<br><br>Some of the tramps began telling stories. One of them, Bill, was an<br>interesting type, a genuine sturdy beggar of the old breed, strong as<br>Hercules and a frank foe of work. He boasted that with his great strength<br>he could get a nawying job any time he liked, but as soon as he drew his<br>first week's wages he went on a terrific drunk and was sacked. Between<br>whiles he 'mooched', chiefly from shopkeepers. He talked like this:<br><br>'I ain't goin' far in--Kent. Kent's a tight county, Kent is. There's<br>too many bin' moochin' about 'ere. The--bakers get so as they'll throw<br>their bread away sooner'n give it you. Now Oxford, that's the place for<br>moochin', Oxford is. When I was in Oxford I mooched bread, and I mooched<br>bacon, and I mooched beef, and every night I mooched tanners for my kip off<br>of the students. The last night I was twopence short of my kip, so I goes<br>up to a parson and mooches 'im for threepence. He give me threepence, and<br>the next moment he turns round and gives me in charge for beggin'. "You bin<br>beggin'," the copper says. "No I ain't," I says, "I was askin' the<br>gentleman the time," I says. The copper starts feelin' inside my coat, and<br>he pulls out a pound of meat and two loaves of bread. "Well, what's all<br>this, then?" he says. "You better come 'long to the station," he says. The<br>beak give me seven days. I don't mooch from no more--parsons. But Christ!<br>what do I care for a lay-up of seven days?' etc. etc.<br><br>It seemed that his whole life was this--a round of mooching, drunks,<br>and lay-ups. He laughed as he talked of it, taking it all for a tremendous<br>joke. He looked as though he made a poor thing out of begging, for he wore<br>only a corduroy suit, scarf, and cap--no socks or linen. Still, he was<br>fat and jolly, and he even smelt of beer, a most unusual smell in a tramp<br>nowadays.<br><br>Two of the tramps had been in Cromley spike recently, and they told a<br>ghost story connected with it. Years earlier, they said, there had been a<br>suicide there. A tramp had managed to smuggle a razor into his cell, and<br>there cut his throat. In the morning, when the Tramp Major came round, the<br>body was jammed against the door, and to open it they had to break the dead<br>man's arm. In revenge for this, the dead man haunted his cell, and anyone<br>who slept there was certain to die within the year; there were copious<br>instances, of course. If a cell door stuck when you tried to open it, you<br>should avoid that cell like the plague, for it was the haunted one.<br><br>Two tramps, ex-sailors, told another grisly story. A man (they swore<br>they had known him) had planned to stow away on a boat bound for Chile. It<br>was laden with manufactured goods packed in big wooden crates, and with the<br>help of a docker the stowaway had managed to hide himself in one of these.<br>But the docker had made a mistake about the order in which the crates were<br>to be loaded. The crane gripped the stowaway, swung him aloft, and<br>deposited him--at the very bottom of the hold, beneath hundreds of<br>crates. No one discovered what had happened until the end of the voyage,<br>when they found the stowaway rotting, dead of suffocation.<br><br>Another tramp told the story of Gilderoy, the Scottish robber.<br>Gilderoy was the man who was condemned to be hanged, escaped, captured the<br>judge who had sentenced him, and (splendid fellow!) hanged him. The tramps<br>liked the story, of course, but the interesting thing was to see that they<br>had got it all wrong. Their version was that Gilderoy escaped to America,<br>whereas in reality he was recaptured and put to death. The story had been<br>amended, no doubt deliberately; just as children amend the stories of<br>Samson and Robin Hood, giving them happy endings which are quite imaginary.<br><br>This set the tramps talking about history, and a very old man declared<br>that the 'one bite law' was a survival from days when the nobles hunted men<br>instead of deer. Some of the others laughed at him, but he had the idea<br>firm in his head. He had heard, too, of the Corn Laws, and the JUS PRIMAE<br>NOCTIS (he believed it had really existed); also of the Great Rebellion,<br>which he thought was a rebellion of poor against rich--perhaps he had got<br>it mixed up with the peasant rebellions. I doubt whether the old man could<br>read, and certainly he was not repeating newspaper articles. His scraps of<br>history had been passed from generation to generation of tramps, perhaps<br>for centuries in some cases. It was oral tradition lingering on, like a<br>faint echo from the Middle Ages.<br><br>Paddy and I went to the spike at six in the evening, getting out at<br>ten in the morning. It was much like Romton and Edbury, and we saw nothing<br>of the ghost. Among the casuals were two young men named William and Fred,<br>ex-fishermen from Norfolk, a lively pair and fond of singing. They had a<br>song called 'Unhappy Bella' that is worth writing down. I heard them sing<br>it half a dozen times during the next two days, and I managed to get it by<br>heart, except a line or two which I have guessed. It ran:<br><br><br>Bella was young and Bella was fair<br>With bright blue eyes and golden hair,<br>O unhappy Bella!<br>Her step was light and her heart was gay,<br>But she had no sense, and one fine day<br>She got herself put in the family way<br>By a wicked, heartless, cruel deceiver.<br><br>Poor Bella was young, she didn't believe<br>That the world is hard and men deceive,<br>O unhappy Bella!<br>She said, 'My man will do what's just,<br>He'll marry me now, because he must';<br>Her heart was full of loving trust<br>In a wicked, heartless, cruel deceiver.<br><br>She went to his house; that dirty skunk<br>Had packed his bags and done a bunk,<br>O unhappy Bella!<br>Her landlady said, 'Get out, you whore,<br>I won't have your sort a-darkening my door.'<br>Poor Bella was put to affliction sore<br>By a wicked, heartless, cruel deceiver.<br><br>All night she tramped the cruel snows,<br>What she must have suffered nobody knows,<br>O unhappy Bella!<br>And when the morning dawned so red,<br>Alas, alas, poor Bella was dead,<br>Sent so young to her lonely bed<br>By a wicked, heartless, cruel deceiver.<br><br>So thus, you see, do what you will,<br>The fruits of sin are suffering still,<br>O unhappy Bella!<br>As into the grave they laid her low,<br>The men said, 'Alas, but life is so,'<br>But the women chanted, sweet and low,<br>'It's all the men, the dirty bastards!'<br><br><br>Written by a woman, perhaps.<br><br>William and Fred, the singers of this song, were thorough scallywags,<br>the sort of men who get tramps a bad name. They happened to know that the<br>Tramp Major at Cromley had a stock of old clothes, which were to be given<br>at need to casuals. Before going in William and Fred took off their boots,<br>ripped the seams and cut pieces off the soles, more or less ruining them.<br>Then they applied for two pairs of boots, and the Tramp Major, seeing how<br>bad their boots were, gave them almost new pairs. William and Fred were<br>scarcely outside the spike in the morning before they had sold these boots<br>for one and ninepence. It seemed to them quite worth while, for one and<br>ninepence, to make their own boots practically unwearable.<br><br>Leaving the spike, we all started southward, a long slouching<br>procession, for Lower Binfield and Ide Hill. On the way there was a fight<br>between two of the tramps. They had quarrelled overnight (there was some<br>silly CASUS BELLI about one saying to the other, 'Bull shit', which was<br>taken for Bolshevik--a deadly insult), and they fought it out in a field.<br>A dozen of us stayed to watch them. The scene sticks in my mind for one<br>thing--the man who was beaten going down, and his cap falling off and<br>showing that his hair was quite white. After that some of us intervened and<br>stopped the fight. Paddy had meanwhile been making inquiries, and found<br>that the real cause of the quarrel was, as usual, a few pennyworth of food.<br><br>We got to Lower Binfield quite early, and Paddy filled in the time by<br>asking for work at back doors. At one house he was given some boxes to chop<br>up for firewood, and, saying he had a mate outside, he brought me in and we<br>did the work together. When it was done the householder told the maid to<br>take us out a cup of tea. I remember the terrified way in which she brought<br>it out, and then, losing her courage, set the cups down on the path and<br>bolted back to the house, shutting herself in the kitchen. So dreadful is<br>the name of 'tramp'. They paid us sixpence each, and we bought a threepenny<br>loaf and half an ounce of tobacco, leaving fivepence.<br><br>Paddy thought it wiser to bury our fivepence, for the Tramp Major at<br>Lower Binfield was renowned as a tyrant and might refuse to admit us if we<br>had any money at all. It is quite a common practice of tramps to bury their<br>money. If they intend to smuggle at all a large sum into the spike they<br>generally sew it into their clothes, which may mean prison if they are<br>caught, of course. Paddy and Bozo used to tell a good story about this. An<br>Irishman (Bozo said it was an Irishman; Paddy said an Englishman), not a<br>tramp, and in possession of thirty pounds, was stranded in a small village<br>where he could not get a bed. He consulted a tramp, who advised him to go<br>to the workhouse. It is quite a regular proceeding, if one cannot get a bed<br>elsewhere, to get one at the workhouse, paying a reasonable sum for it. The<br>Irishman, however, thought he would be clever and get a bed for nothing, so<br>he presented himself at the workhouse as an ordinary casual. He had sewn<br>the thirty pounds into his clothes. Meanwhile the tramp who had advised him<br>had seen his chance, and that night he privately asked the Tramp Major for<br>permission to leave the spike early in the morning, as he had to see about<br>a job. At six in the morning he was released and went out--in the<br>Irishman's clothes. The Irishman complained of the theft, and was given<br>thirty days for going into a casual ward under false pretences.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/32.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/34.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
