<h2>Chapter XXXVI</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>I want to set down some general remarks about tramps. When one comes<br>to think of it, tramps are a queer product and worth thinking over. It is<br>queer that a tribe of men, tens of thousands in number, should be marching<br>up and down England like so many Wandering Jews. But though the case<br>obviously wants considering, one cannot even start to consider it until one<br>has got rid of certain prejudices. These prejudices are rooted in the idea<br>that every tramp, IPSO FACTO, is a blackguard. In childhood we have been<br>taught that tramps are blackguards, and consequently there exists in our<br>minds a sort of ideal or typical tramp--a repulsive, rather dangerous<br>creature, who would die rather than work or wash, and wants nothing but to<br>beg, drink, and rob hen-houses. This tramp-monster is no truer to life than<br>the sinister Chinaman of the magazine stories, but he is very hard to get<br>rid of. The very word 'tramp' evokes his image. And the belief in him<br>obscures the real questions of vagrancy.<br><br>To take a fundamental question about vagrancy: Why do tramps exist at<br>all? It is a curious thing, but very few people know what makes a tramp<br>take to the road. And, because of the belief in the tramp-monster, the most<br>fantastic reasons are suggested. It is said, for instance, that tramps<br>tramp to avoid work, to beg more easily, to seek opportunities for crime,<br>even--least probable of reasons--because they like tramping. I have<br>even read in a book of criminology that the tramp is an atavism, a<br>throw-back to the nomadic stage of humanity. And meanwhile the quite<br>obvious cause of vagrancy is staring one in the face. Of course a tramp is<br>not a nomadic atavism--one might as well say that a commercial traveller<br>is an atavism. A tramp tramps, not because he likes it, but for the same<br>reason as a car keeps to the left; because there happens to be a law<br>compelling him to do so. A destitute man, if he is not supported by the<br>parish, can only get relief at the casual wards, and as each casual ward<br>will only admit him for one night, he is automatically kept moving. He is a<br>vagrant because, in the state of the law, it is that or starve. But people<br>have been brought up to believe in the tramp-monster, and so they prefer to<br>think that there must be some more or less villainous motive for tramping.<br><br>As a matter of fact, very little of the tramp-monster will survive<br>inquiry. Take the generally accepted idea that tramps are dangerous<br>characters. Quite apart from experience, one can say A PRIORI that very few<br>tramps are dangerous, because if they were dangerous they would be treated<br>accordingly. A casual ward will often admit a hundred tramps in one night,<br>and these are handled by a staff of at most three porters. A hundred<br>ruffians could not be controlled by three unarmed men. Indeed, when one<br>sees how tramps let themselves be bullied by the workhouse officials, it is<br>obvious that they are the most docile, broken-spirited creatures<br>imaginable. Or take the idea that all tramps are drunkards--an idea<br>ridiculous on the face of it. No doubt many tramps would drink if they got<br>the chance, but in the nature of things they cannot get the chance. At this<br>moment a pale watery stuff called beer is sevenpence a pint in England. To<br>be drunk on it would cost at least half a crown, and a man who can command<br>half a crown at all often is not a tramp. The idea that tramps are impudent<br>social parasites ('sturdy beggars') is not absolutely unfounded, but it is<br>only true in a few per cent of the cases. Deliberate, cynical parasitism,<br>such as one reads of in Jack London's books on American tramping, is not in<br>the English character. The English are a conscience-ridden race, with a<br>strong sense of the sinfulness of poverty. One cannot imagine the average<br>Englishman deliberately turning parasite, and this national character does<br>not necessarily change because a man is thrown out of work. Indeed, if one<br>remembers that a tramp is only an Englishman out of work, forced by law to<br>live as a vagabond, then the tramp-monster vanishes. I am not saying, of<br>course, that most tramps are ideal characters; I am only saying that they<br>are ordinary human beings, and that if they are worse than other people it<br>is the result and not the cause of their way of life.<br><br>It follows that the 'Serve them damned well right' attitude that is<br>normally taken towards tramps is no fairer than it would be towards<br>cripples or invalids. When one has realized that, one begins to put oneself<br>in a tramp's place and understand what his life is like. It is an<br>extraordinarily futile, acutely unpleasant life. I have described the<br>casual ward--the routine of a tramp's day--but there are three especial<br>evils that need insisting upon. The first is hunger, which is the almost<br>general fate of tramps. The casual ward gives them a ration which is<br>probably not even meant to be sufficient, and anything beyond this must be<br>got by begging--that is, by breaking the law. The result is that nearly<br>every tramp is rotted by malnutrition; for proof of which one need only<br>look at the men lining up outside any casual ward. The second great evil of<br>a tramp's life--it seems much smaller at first sight, but it is a good<br>second--is that he is entirely cut off from contact with women. This<br>point needs elaborating.<br><br>Tramps are cut off from women, in the first place, because there are<br>very few women at their level of society. One might imagine that among<br>destitute people the sexes would be as equally balanced as elsewhere. But<br>it is not so; in fact, one can almost say that below a certain level<br>society is entirely male. The following figures, published by the L.C.C.<br>from a night census taken on February 13th, 1931, will show the relative<br>numbers of destitute men and destitute women:<br><br><br>Spending the night in the streets, 60 men, 18 women*.<br>In shelters and homes not licensed as common lodging-houses, 1,057 men,<br>137 women.<br>In the crypt of St Martin's-in-the-Fields Church, 88 men, 12 women.<br>In L.C.C. casual wards and hostels, 674 men, 15 women.<br><br>[* This must be an underestimate. Still, the proportions probably<br>hold good.]<br><br><br>It will be seen from these figures that at the charity level men<br>outnumber women by something like ten to one. The cause is presumably that<br>unemployment affects women less than men; also that any presentable woman<br>can, in the last resort, attach herself to some man. The result, for a<br>tramp, is that he is condemned to perpetual celibacy. For of course it goes<br>without saying that if a tramp finds no women at his own level, those above<br>--even a very little above--are as far out of his reach as the moon. The<br>reasons are not worth discussing, but there is no doubt that women never,<br>or hardly ever, condescend to men who are much poorer than themselves. A<br>tramp, therefore, is a celibate from the moment when he takes to the road.<br>He is absolutely without hope of getting a wife, a mistress, or any kind of<br>woman except--very rarely, when he can raise a few shillings--a<br>prostitute.<br><br>It is obvious what the results of this must be: homosexuality, for<br>instance, and occasional rape cases. But deeper than these there is the<br>degradation worked in a man who knows that he is not even considered fit<br>for marriage. The sexual impulse, not to put it any higher, is a<br>fundamental impulse, and starvation of it can be almost as demoralizing as<br>physical hunger. The evil of poverty is not so much that it makes a man<br>suffer as that it rots him physically and spiritually. And there can be no<br>doubt that sexual starvation contributes to this rotting process. Cut off<br>from the whole race of women, a tramp feels himself degraded to the rank of<br>a cripple or a lunatic. No humiliation could do more damage to a man's<br>self-respect.<br><br>The other great evil of a tramp's life is enforced idleness. By our<br>vagrancy laws things are so arranged that when he is not walking the road<br>he is sitting in a cell; or, in the intervals, lying on the ground waiting<br>for the casual ward to open. It is obvious that this is a dismal,<br>demoralizing way of life, especially for an uneducated man.<br><br>Besides these one could enumerate scores of minor evils--to name<br>only one, discomfort, which is inseparable from life on the road; it is<br>worth remembering that the average tramp has no clothes but what he stands<br>up in, wears boots that are ill-fitting, and does not sit in a chair for<br>months together. But the important point is that a tramp's sufferings are<br>entirely useless. He lives a fantastically disagreeable life, and lives it<br>to no purpose whatever. One could not, in fact, invent a more futile<br>routine than walking from prison to prison, spending perhaps eighteen hours<br>a day in the cell and on the road. There must be at the least several tens<br>of thousands of tramps in England. Each day they expend innumerable<br>foot-pounds of energy--enough to plough thousands of acres, build miles<br>of road, put up dozens of houses--in mere, useless walking. Each day they<br>waste between them possibly ten years of time in staring at cell walls.<br>They cost the country at least a pound a week a man, and give nothing in<br>return for it. They go round and round, on an endless boring game of<br>general post, which is of no use, and is not even meant to be of any use to<br>any person whatever. The law keeps this process going, and we have got so<br>accustomed to it that We are not surprised. But it is very silly.<br><br>Granting the futility of a tramp's life, the question is whether<br>anything could be done to improve it. Obviously it would be possible, for<br>instance, to make the casual wards a little more habitable, and this is<br>actually being done in some cases. During the last year some of the casual<br>wards have been improved--beyond recognition, if the accounts are true--<br>and there is talk of doing the same to all of them. But this does not go to<br>the heart of the problem. The problem is how to turn the tramp from a<br>bored, half alive vagrant into a self-respecting human being. A mere<br>increase of comfort cannot do this. Even if the casual wards became<br>positively luxurious (they never will)* a tramp's life would still be<br>wasted. He would still be a pauper, cut off from marriage and home life,<br>and a dead loss to the community. What is needed is to depauperize him, and<br>this can only be done by finding him work--not work for the sake of<br>working, but work of which he can enjoy the benefit. At present, in the<br>great majority of casual wards, tramps do no work whatever. At one time<br>they were made to break stones for their food, but this was stopped when<br>they had broken enough stone for years ahead and put the stone-breakers out<br>of work. Nowadays they are kept idle, because there is seemingly nothing<br>for them to do. Yet there is a fairly obvious way of making them useful,<br>namely this: Each workhouse could run a small farm, or at least a kitchen<br>garden, and every able-bodied tramp who presented himself could be made to<br>do a sound day's work. The produce of the farm or garden could be used for<br>feeding the tramps, and at the worst it would be better than the filthy<br>diet of bread and margarine and tea. Of course, the casual wards could<br>never be quite self-supporting, but they could go a long way towards it,<br>and the rates would probably benefit in the long run. It must be remembered<br>that under the present system tramps are as dead a loss to the country as<br>they could possibly be, for they do not only do no work, but they live on a<br>diet that is bound to undermine their health; the system, therefore, loses<br>lives as well as money. A scheme which fed them decently, and made them<br>produce at least a part of their own food, would be worth trying.<br><br>[* In fairness, it must be added that a few of the casual wards have been<br>improved recently, at least from the point of view of sleeping<br>accommodation. But most of them are the same as ever, and there has been<br>no real improvement in the food.]<br><br>It may be objected that a farm or even a garden could not be run with<br>casual labour. But there is no real reason why tramps should only stay a<br>day at each casual ward; they might stay a month or even a year, if there<br>were work for them to do. The constant circulation of tramps is something<br>quite artificial. At present a tramp is an expense to the rates, and the<br>object of each workhouse is therefore to push him on to the next; hence the<br>rule that he can stay only one night. If he returns within a month he is<br>penalized by being confined for a week, and, as this is much the same as<br>being in prison, naturally he keeps moving. But if he represented labour to<br>the workhouse, and the workhouse represented sound food to him, it would be<br>another matter. The workhouses would develop into partially self-supporting<br>institutions, and the tramps, settling down here or there according as they<br>were needed, would cease to be tramps. They would be doing something<br>comparatively useful, getting decent food, and living a settled life. By<br>degrees, if the scheme worked well, they might even cease to be regarded as<br>paupers, and be able to marry and take a respectable place in society.<br><br>This is only a rough idea, and there are some obvious objections to<br>it. Nevertheless, it does suggest a way of improving the status of tramps<br>without piling new burdens on the rates. And the solution must, in any<br>case, be something of this kind. For the question is, what to do with men<br>who are underfed and idle; and the answer--to make them grow their own<br>food--imposes itself automatically.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/34.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/36.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
