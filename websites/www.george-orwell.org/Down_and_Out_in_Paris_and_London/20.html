<h2>Chapter XXI</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>This life went on for about a fortnight, with a slight increase of<br>work as more customers came to the restaurant. I could have saved an hour a<br>day by taking a room near the restaurant, but it seemed impossible to find<br>time to change lodgings--or, for that matter, to get my hair cut, look at<br>a newspaper, or even undress completely. After ten days I managed to find a<br>free quarter of an hour, and wrote to my friend B. in London asking him if<br>he could get me a job of some sort--anything, so long as it allowed more<br>than five hours sleep. I was simply not equal to going on with a<br>seventeen-hour day, though there are plenty of people who think nothing of<br>it. When one is overworked, it is a good cure for self-pity to think of the<br>thousands of people in Paris restaurants who work such hours, and will go<br>on doing it, not for a few weeks, but for years. There was a girl in a<br>BISTRO near my hotel who worked from seven in the morning till midnight for<br>a whole year, only sitting down to her meals. I remember once asking her to<br>come to a dance, and she laughed and said that she had not been farther<br>than the street comer for several months. She was consumptive, and died<br>about the time I left Paris.<br><br>After only a week we were all neurasthenic with fatigue, except Jules,<br>who skulked persistently. The quarrels, intermittent at first, had now<br>become continuous. For hours' one would keep up a drizzle of useless<br>nagging, rising into storms of abuse every few minutes. 'Get me down that<br>saucepan, idiot!' the cook would cry (she was not tall enough to reach the<br>shelves where the saucepans were kept). 'Get it down yourself, you old<br>whore,' I would answer. Such remarks seemed to be generated spontaneously<br>from the air of the kitchen.<br><br>We quarrelled over things of inconceivable pettiness. The dustbin, for<br>instance, was an unending source of quarrels--whether it should be put<br>where I wanted it, which was in the cook's way, or where she wanted it,<br>which was between me and the sink. Once she nagged and nagged until at<br>last, in pure spite, I lifted the dustbin up and put it out in the middle<br>of the floor, where she was bound to trip over it.<br><br>'Now, you cow,' I said, 'move it yourself.'<br><br>Poor old woman, it was too heavy for her to lift, and she sat down,<br>put her head on the table and burst out crying. And I jeered at her. This<br>is the kind of effect that fatigue has upon one's manners.<br><br>After a few days the cook had ceased talking about Tolstoy and her<br>artistic nature, and she and I were not on speaking terms, except for the<br>purposes of work, and Boris and Jules were not on speaking terms, and<br>neither of them was on speaking terms with the cook. Even Boris and I were<br>barely on speaking terms. We had agreed beforehand that the ENGUEULADES of<br>working hours did not count between times; but we had called each other<br>things too bad to be forgotten--and besides, there were no between times.<br>Jules grew lazier and lazier, and he stole food constantly--from a sense<br>of duty, he said. He called the rest of us JAUNE--blackleg--when we<br>would not join with him in stealing. He had a curious, malignant spirit. He<br>told me, as a matter of pride, that he had sometimes wrung a dirty<br>dishcloth into a customer's soup before taking it in, just to be revenged<br>upon a member of the bourgeoisie.<br><br>The kitchen grew dirtier and the rats bolder, though we trapped a few<br>of them. Looking round that filthy room, with raw meat lying among refuse<br>on the floor, and cold, clotted saucepans sprawling everywhere, and the<br>sink blocked and coated with grease, I used to wonder whether there could<br>be a restaurant in the world as bad as ours. But the other three all said<br>that they had been in dirtier places. Jules took a positive pleasure in<br>seeings things dirty. In the afternoon, when he had not much to do, he used<br>to stand in the kitchen doorway jeering at us for working too hard:<br><br>'Fool! Why do you wash that plate? Wipe it on your trousers. Who cares<br>about the customers? THEY don't know what's going on. What is restaurant<br>work? You are carving a chicken and it falls on the floor. You apologize,<br>you bow, you go out; and in five minutes you come back by another door--<br>with the same chicken. That is restaurant work,' etc.<br><br>And, strange to say, in spite of all this filth and incompetence, the<br>Auberge de Jehan Cottard was actually a success. For the first few days all<br>our customers were Russians, friends of the PATRON, and these were followed<br>by Americans and other foreigners--no Frenchmen. Then one night there was<br>tremendous excitement, because our first Frenchman had arrived. For a<br>moment our quarrels were forgotten and we all united in the effort to serve<br>a good dinner. Boris tiptoed into the kitchen, jerked his thumb over his<br>shoulder and whispered conspiratorially:<br><br>'SH! ATTENTION, UN FRANCAIS!'<br><br>A moment later the PATRON's wife came and whispered:<br><br>'ATTENTION, UN FRANCAIS! See that he gets a double portion of all<br>vegetables.'<br><br>While the Frenchman ate, the PATRON'S wife stood behind the grille of<br>the kitchen door and watched the expression of his face. Next night the<br>Frenchman came back with two other Frenchmen. This meant that we were<br>earning a good name; the surest sign of a bad restaurant is to be<br>frequented only by foreigners. Probably part of the reason for our success<br>was that the PATRON, with the sole gleam of sense he had shown in fitting<br>out the restaurant, had bought very sharp table-knives. Sharp knives, of<br>course, are THE secret of a successful restaurant. I am glad that this<br>happened, for it destroyed one of my illusions, namely, the idea that<br>Frenchmen know good food when they see it. Or perhaps we WERE a fairly good<br>restaurant by Paris standards; in which case the bad ones must be past<br>imagining.<br><br>In a very few days after I had written to B he replied to say that<br>there was a job he could get for me. It was to look after a congenital<br>imbecile, which sounded a splendid rest cure after the Auberge de Jehan<br>Cottard. I pictured myself loafing in the country lanes, knocking<br>thistle-heads off with my stick, feeding on roast lamb and treacle tart,<br>and sleeping ten hours a night in sheets smelling of lavender. B sent me a<br>fiver to pay my passage and get my clothes out of the pawn, and as soon as<br>the money arrived I gave one day's notice and left the restaurant. My<br>leaving so suddenly embarrassed the PATRON, for as usual he was penniless,<br>and he had to pay my wages thirty francs short. However he stood me a glass<br>of Courvoisier '48 brandy, and I think he felt that this made up the<br>difference. They engaged a Czech, a thoroughly competent PLONGEUR, in my<br>place, and the poor old cook was sacked a few weeks later. Afterwards I<br>heard that, with two first-rate people in the kitchen, the PLONGEUR'S work<br>had been cut down to fifteen hours a day. Below that no one could have cut<br>it, short of modernizing the kitchen.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/19.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/21.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
