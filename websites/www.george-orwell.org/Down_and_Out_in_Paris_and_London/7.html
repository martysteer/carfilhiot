<h2>Chapter VIII</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>We had now twenty-eight francs in hand, and could start looking for<br>work once more. Boris was still sleeping, on some mysterious terms, at the<br>house of the cobbler, and he had managed to borrow another twenty francs<br>from a Russian friend. He had friends, mostly ex-officers like himself,<br>here and there all over Paris. Some were waiters or dishwashers, some drove<br>taxis, a few lived on women, some had managed to bring money away from<br>Russia and owned garages or dancing-halls. In general, the Russian refugees<br>in Paris are hard-working people, and have put up with/their bad luck far<br>better than one can imagine Englishmen of the same class doing. There are<br>exceptions, of course. Boris told me of an exiled Russian duke whom he had<br>once met, who frequented expensive restaurants. The duke would find out if<br>there was a Russian officer among the waiters, and, after he had dined,<br>call him in a friendly way to his table.<br><br>'Ah,' the duke would say, 'so you are an old soldier, like myself?<br>These are bad days, eh? Well, well, the Russian soldier fears nothing. And<br>what was your regiment?'<br><br>'The so-and-so, sir,' the waiter would answer.<br><br>'A very gallant regiment! I inspected them in 1912. By the way, I have<br>unfortunately left my notecase at home. A Russian officer will, I know,<br>oblige me with three hundred francs.'<br><br>If the waiter had three hundred francs he would hand it over, and, of<br>course, never see it again. The duke made quite a lot in this way. Probably<br>the waiters did not mind being swindled. A duke is a duke, even in exile.<br><br>It was through one of these Russian refugees that Boris heard of<br>something which seemed to promise money. Two days after we had pawned the<br>overcoats, Boris said to me rather mysteriously:<br><br>'Tell me, MON AMI, have you any political opinions?'<br><br>'No,'I said.<br><br>'Neither have I. Of course, one is always a patriot; but still--Did<br>not Moses say something about spoiling the Egyptians? As an Englishman you<br>will have read the Bible. What I mean is, would you object to earning money<br>from Communists?'<br><br>'No, of course not.'<br><br>'Well, it appears that there is a Russian secret society in Paris who<br>might do something for us. They are Communists; in fact they are agents for<br>the Bolsheviks. They act as a friendly society, get in touch with exiled<br>Russians, and try to get them to turn Bolshevik. My friend has joined their<br>society, and he thinks they would help us if we went to them.'<br><br>'But what can they do for us? In any case they won't help me, as I'm<br>not a Russian.'<br><br>'That is just the point. It seems that they are correspondents for a<br>Moscow paper, and they want some articles on English politics. If we got to<br>them at once they may commission you to write the articles.'<br><br>'Me? But I don't know anything about politics.'<br><br>'MERDE! Neither do they. Who DOES know anything about politics? It's<br>easy. All you have to do is to copy it out of the English papers. Isn't<br>there a Paris DAILY MAIL? Copy it from that.'<br><br>'But the DAILY MAIL is a Conservative paper. They loathe the<br>Communists.'<br><br>'Well, say the opposite of what the DAILY MAIL says, then you can't be<br>wrong. We mustn't throw this chance away, MON AMI. It might mean hundreds<br>of francs.'<br><br>I did not like the idea, for the Paris police are very hard on<br>Communists, especially if they are foreigners, and I was already under<br>suspicion. Some months before, a detective had seen me come out of the<br>office of a Communist weekly paper, and I had had a great deal of trouble<br>with the police. If they caught me going to this secret society, it might<br>mean deportation. However, the chance seemed too good to be missed. That<br>afternoon Boris's friend, another waiter, came to take us to the<br>rendezvous. I cannot remember the name of the street--it was a shabby<br>street running south from the Seine bank, somewhere near the Chamber of<br>Deputies. Boris's friend insisted on great caution. We loitered casually<br>down the street, marked the doorway we were to enter--it was a laundry--<br>and then strolled back again, keeping an eye on all the windows and cafes.<br>If the place were known as a haunt of Communists it was probably watched,<br>and we intended to go home if we saw anyone at all like a detective. I was<br>frightened, but Boris enjoyed these conspiratorial proceedings, and quite<br>forgot that he was about to trade with the slayers of his parents.<br><br>When we were certain that the coast was clear we dived quickly into<br>the doorway. In the laundry was a Frenchwoman ironing clothes, who told us<br>that 'the Russian gentlemen' lived up a staircase across the courtyard. We<br>went up several flights of dark stairs and emerged on to a landing. A<br>strong, surly-looking young man, with hair growing low on his head, was<br>standing at the top of the stairs. As I came up he looked at me<br>suspiciously, barred the way with his arm and said something in Russian.<br><br>'MOT D'ORDRE!' he said sharply when I did not answer.<br><br>I stopped, startled. I had not expected passwords.<br><br>'MOT D'ORDRE!' repeated the Russian.<br><br>Boris's friend, who was walking behind, now came forward and said<br>something in Russian, either the password or an explanation. At this, the<br>surly young man seemed satisfied, and led us into a small, shabby room with<br>frosted windows. It was like a very poverty-stricken office, with<br>propaganda posters in Russian lettering and a huge, crude picture of Lenin<br>tacked on the walls. At the table sat an unshaven Russian in shirt sleeves,<br>addressing newspaper wrappers from a pile in front of him. As I came in he<br>spoke to me in French, with a bad accent.<br><br>'This is very careless!' he exclaimed fussily. 'Why have you come here<br>without a parcel of washing?'<br><br>'Washing?'<br><br>'Everybody who comes here brings washing. It looks as though they were<br>going to the laundry downstairs. Bring a good, large bundle next time. We<br>don't want the police on our tracks.'<br><br>This was even more conspiratorial than I had expected. Boris sat down<br>in the only vacant chair, and there was a great deal of talking in Russian.<br>Only the unshaven man talked; the surly one leaned against the wall with<br>his eyes on me, as though he still suspected me. It was queer, standing in<br>the little secret room with its revolutionary posters, listening to a<br>conversation of which I did not understand a word. The Russians talked<br>quickly and eagerly, with smiles and shrugs of the shoulders. I wondered<br>what it was all about. They would be calling each other 'little father', I<br>thought, and 'little dove', and 'Ivan Alexandrovitch', like the characters<br>in Russian novels. And the talk would be of revolutions. The unshaven man<br>would be saying firmly, 'We never argue. Controversy is a bourgeois<br>pastime. Deeds are our arguments.' Then I gathered that it was not this<br>exactly. Twenty francs was being demanded, for an entrance fee apparently,<br>and Boris was promising to pay it (we had just seventeen francs in the<br>world). Finally Boris produced our precious store of money and paid five<br>francs on account.<br><br>At this the surly man looked less suspicious, and sat down on the edge<br>of the table. The unshaven one began to question me in French, making notes<br>on a slip of paper. Was I a Communist? he asked. By sympathy, I answered; I<br>had never joined any organization. Did I understand the political situation<br>in England? Oh, of course, of course. I mentioned the names of various<br>Ministers, and made some contemptuous remarks about the Labour Party. And<br>what about LE SPORT? Could I do articles on LE SPORT? (Football and<br>Socialism have some mysterious connexion on the Continent.) Oh, of course,<br>again. Both men nodded gravely. The unshaven one said:<br><br>'EVIDEMMENT, you have a thorough knowledge of conditions in England.<br>Could you undertake to write a series of articles for a Moscow weekly<br>paper? We will give you the particulars.'<br><br>'Certainly.'<br><br>'Then, comrade, you will hear from us by the first post tomorrow. Or<br>possibly the second post. Our rate of pay is a hundred and fifty francs an<br>article. Remember to bring a parcel of washing next time you come.<br>AU REVOIR, comrade.'<br><br>We went downstairs, looked carefully out of the laundry to see if<br>there was anyone in the street, and slipped out. Boris was wild with joy.<br>In a sort of sacrificial ecstasy he rushed into the nearest tobacconist's<br>and spent fifty centimes on a cigar. He came out thumping his stick on the<br>pavement and beaming.<br><br>'At last! At last! Now, MON AMI, out fortune really is made. You took<br>them in finely. Did you hear him call you comrade? A hundred and fifty<br>francs an article--NOM DE DIEU, what luck!'<br><br>Next morning when I heard the postman I rushed down to the BISTRO for<br>my letter; to my disappointment, it had not come. I stayed at home for the<br>second post; still no letter. When three days had gone by and I had not<br>heard from the secret society, we gave up hope, deciding that they must<br>have found somebody else to do their articles.<br><br>Ten days later we made another visit to the office of the secret<br>society, taking care to bring a parcel that looked like washing. And the<br>secret society had vanished! The woman in the laundry knew nothing--she<br>simply said that 'CES MESSIEURS' had left some days ago, after trouble<br>about the rent. What fools we looked, standing there with our parcel! But<br>it was a consolation that we had paid only five francs instead of twenty.<br><br>And that was the last we ever heard of the secret society. Who or what<br>they really were, nobody knew. Personally I do not think they had anything<br>to do with the Communist Party; I think they were simply swindlers, who<br>preyed upon Russian refugees by extracting entrance fees to an imaginary<br>society. It was quite safe, and no doubt they are still doing it in some<br>other city. They were clever fellows, and played their part admirably.<br>Their office looked exactly as a secret Communist office should look, and<br>as for that touch about bringing a parcel of washing, it was genius.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/6.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/8.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
