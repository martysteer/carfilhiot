<h2>Chapter VI</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>We again failed to find work the next day, and it was three weeks<br>before the luck changed. My two hundred francs saved me from trouble about<br>the rent, but everything else went as badly as possible. Day after day<br>Boris and I went up and down Paris, drifting at two miles an hour through<br>the crowds, bored and hungry, and finding nothing. One day, I remember, we<br>crossed the Seine eleven times. We loitered for hours outside service<br>doorways, and when the manager came out we would go up to him<br>ingratiatingly, cap in hand. We always got the same answer: they did not<br>want a lame man, nor a man without experience. Once we were very nearly<br>engaged. While we spoke to the manager Boris stood straight upright, not<br>supporting himself with his stick, and the .manager did not see that he was<br>lame. 'Yes,' he said, 'we want two men in the cellars. Perhaps you would<br>do. Come inside.' Then Boris moved, the game was up. 'Ah,' said the<br>manager, 'you limp. MALHEUREUSEMENT--'<br><br>We enrolled our names at agencies and answered advertisements, but<br>walking everywhere made us slow, and we seemed to miss every job by half an<br>hour. Once we very nearly got a job swabbing out railway trucks, but at the<br>last moment they rejected us in favour of Frenchmen. Once we answered an<br>advertisement calling for hands at a circus. You had to shift benches and<br>clean up litter, and, during the performance, stand on two tubs and let a<br>lion jump through your legs. When we got to the place, an hour before the<br>time named, we found a queue of fifty men already waiting. There is some<br>attraction in lions, evidently.<br><br>Once an agency to which I had applied months earlier sent me a PETIT<br>BLEU, telling me of an Italian gentleman who wanted English lessons. The<br>PETIT BLEU said 'Come at once' and promised twenty francs an hour. Boris<br>and I were in despair. Here was a splendid chance, and I could not take it,<br>for it was impossible to go to the agency with my coat out at the elbow.<br>Then it occurred to us that I could wear Boris's coat--it did not match<br>my trousers, but the trousers were grey and might pass for flannel at a<br>short distance. The coat was so much too big for me that I had to wear it<br>unbuttoned and keep one hand in my pocket. I hurried out, and wasted<br>seventy-five centimes on a bus fare to get to the agency. When I got there<br>I found that the Italian had changed his mind and left Paris.<br><br>Once Boris suggested that I should go to Les Halles and try for a job<br>as a porter. I arrived at half-past four in the morning, when the work was<br>getting into its swing. Seeing a short, fat man in a bowler hat directing<br>some porters, I went up to him and asked for work. Before answering he<br>seized my right hand and felt the palm.<br><br>'You are strong, eh?' he said.<br><br>'Very strong,' I said untruly.<br><br>'BIEN. Let me see you lift that crate.'<br><br>It was a huge wicker basket full of potatoes. I took hold of it, and<br>found that, so far from lifting it, I could not even move it. The man in<br>the bowler hat watched me, then shrugged his shoulders and turned away. I<br>made off. When I had gone some distance I looked back and saw FOUR men<br>lifting the basket on to a cart. It weighed three hundredweight, possibly.<br>The man had seen that I was no use, and taken this way of getting rid of me.<br><br>Sometimes in his hopeful moments Boris spent fifty centimes on a stamp<br>and wrote to one of his ex-mistresses, asking for money. Only one of them<br>ever replied. It was a woman who, besides having been his mistress, owed<br>him two hundred francs. When Boris saw the letter waiting and recognized<br>the handwriting, he was wild with hope. We seized the letter and rushed up<br>to Boris's room to read it, like a child with stolen sweets. Boris read the<br>letter, then handed it silently to me. It ran:<br><br><br>My Little Cherished Wolf,<br><br>With what delight did I open thy charming letter, reminding me<br>of the days of our perfect love, and of the so dear kisses which I<br>have received from thy lips. Such memories linger for ever in the<br>heart, like the perfume of a flower that is dead.<br><br>As to thy request for two hundred francs, alas! it is<br>impossible. Thou dost not know, my dear one, how I am desolated to<br>hear of thy embarrassments. But what wouldst thou? In this life<br>which is so sad, trouble conies to everyone. I too have had my<br>share. My little sister has been ill (ah, the poor little one, how<br>she suffered!) and we are obliged to pay I know not what to the<br>doctor. All our money is gone and we are passing, I assure thee,<br>very difficult days.<br><br>Courage, my little wolf, always the courage! Remember that the<br>bad days are not for ever, and the trouble which seems so terrible<br>will disappear at last.<br><br>Rest assured, my dear one, that I will remember thee always. And<br>receive the most sincere embraces of her who has never ceased to<br>love thee, thy<br><br>Yvonne<br><br><br>This letter disappointed Boris so much that he went straight to bed<br>and would not look for work again that day. My sixty francs lasted about a<br>fortnight. I had given up the pretence of going out to restaurants, and we<br>used to eat in my room, one of us sitting on the bed and the other on the<br>chair. Boris would contribute his two francs and I three or four francs,<br>and we would buy bread, potatoes, milk and cheese, and make soup over my<br>spirit lamp. We had a saucepan and a coffee-bowl and one spoon; every day<br>there was a polite squabble as to who should eat out of the saucepan and<br>who out of the coffee-bowl (the saucepan held more), and every day, to my<br>secret anger, Boris gave in first and had the saucepan. Sometimes we had<br>more bread in the evening, sometimes not. Our linen was getting filthy, and<br>it was three weeks since I had had a bath; Boris, so he said, had not had a<br>bath for months. It was tobacco that made everything tolerable. We had<br>plenty of tobacco, for some time before Boris had met a soldier (the<br>soldiers are given their tobacco free) and bought twenty or thirty packets<br>at fifty centimes each.<br><br>All this was far worse for Boris than for me. The walking and sleeping<br>on the floor kept his leg and back in constant pain, and with his vast<br>Russian appetite he suffered torments of hunger, though he never seemed to<br>grow thinner. On the whole he was surprisingly gay, and he had vast<br>capacities for hope. He used to say seriously that he had a PATRON saint<br>who watched over him, and when things were very bad he would search the<br>gutter for money, saying that the saint often dropped a two-franc piece<br>there. One day we were waiting in the rue Royale; there was a Russian<br>restaurant near by, and we were going to ask for a job there. Suddenly,<br>Boris made up his mind to go into the Madeleine and bum a fifty-centime<br>candle to his PATRON saint. Then, coming out, he said that he would be on<br>the safe side, and solemnly put a match to a fifty-centime stamp, as a<br>sacrifice to the immortal gods. Perhaps the gods and the saints did not get<br>on together; at any rate, we missed the job.<br><br>On some mornings Boris collapsed in the most utter despair. He would<br>lie in bed almost weeping, cursing the Jew with whom he lived. Of late the<br>Jew had become restive about paying the daily two francs, and, what was<br>worse, had begun putting on intolerable airs of PATRONage. Boris said that<br>I, as an Englishman, could not conceive what torture it was to a Russian of<br>family to be at the mercy of a Jew.<br><br>'A Jew, MON AMI, a veritable Jew! And he hasn't even the decency to be<br>ashamed of it. To think that I, a captain in the Russian Army--have I<br>ever told you, MON AMI, that I was a captain in the Second Siberian Rifles?<br>Yes, a captain, and my father was a colonel. And here I am, eating the<br>bread of a Jew. A Jew...<br><br>'I will tell you what Jews are like. Once, in the early months of the<br>war, we were on the march, and we had halted at a village for the night. A<br>horrible old Jew, with a red beard like Judas Iscariot, came sneaking up to<br>my billet. I asked him what he wanted. "Your honour," he said, "I have<br>brought a girl for you, a beautiful young girl only seventeen. It will only<br>be fifty francs." "Thank you," I said, "you can take her away again. I<br>don't want to catch any diseases." "Diseases!" cried the Jew, "MAIS,<br>MONSIEUR LE CAPITAINE, there's no fear of that. It's my own daughter!" That<br>is the Jewish national character for you.<br><br>'Have I ever told you, MON AMI, that in the old Russian Army it was<br>considered bad form to spit on a Jew? Yes, we thought a Russian officer's<br>spittle was too precious to be wasted on Jews...' etc. etc.<br><br>On these days Boris usually declared himself too ill to go out and<br>look for work. He would lie till evening in the greyish, verminous sheets,<br>smoking and reading old newspapers. Sometimes we played chess. We had no<br>board, but we wrote down the moves on a piece of paper, and afterwards we<br>made a board from the side of a packing--case, and a set of men from<br>buttons, Belgian coins and the like. Boris, like many Russians, had a<br>passion for chess. It was a saying of his that the rules of chess are the<br>same as the rules of love and war, and that if you can win at one you can<br>win at the others. But he also said that if you have a chessboard you do<br>not mind being hungry, which was certainly not true in my case.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/4.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/6.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
