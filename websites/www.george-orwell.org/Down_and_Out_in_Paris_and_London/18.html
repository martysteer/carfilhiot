<h2>Chapter XIX</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>One day, when we had been at the Hotel X five or six weeks, Boris<br>disappeared without notice. In the evening I found him waiting for me in<br>the Rue de Rivoli. He slapped me gaily on the shoulder.<br><br>'Free at last, MON AMI! You can give notice in the morning. The<br>Auberge opens tomorrow.'<br><br>'Tomorrow?'<br><br>'Well, possibly we shall need a day or two to arrange things. But, at<br>any rate, no more CAFETERIA! NOUS SOMMES LANCES, MON AMI! My tail coat is<br>out of pawn already.'<br><br>His manner was so hearty that I felt sure there was something wrong,<br>and I did not at all want to leave my safe and comfortable job at the<br>hotel. However, I had promised Boris, so I gave notice, and the next<br>morning at seven went down to the Auberge de Jehan Cottard. It was locked,<br>and I went in search of Boris, who had once more bolted from his lodgings<br>and taken a room in the rue de la Groix Nivert. I found him asleep,<br>together with a girl whom he had picked up the night before, and who he<br>told me was 'of a very sympathetic temperament.' As to the restaurant, he<br>said that it was all arranged; there were only a few little things to be<br>seen to before we opened.<br><br>At ten I managed to get Boris out of bed, and we unlocked the<br>restaurant. At a glance I saw what the 'few little things' amounted to. It<br>was briefly this: that the alterations had not been touched since our last<br>visit. The stoves for the kitchen had not arrived, the water and<br>electricity had not been laid on, and there was all manner of painting,<br>polishing and carpentering to be done. Nothing short of a miracle could<br>open the restaurant within ten days, and by the look of things it might<br>collapse without even opening. It was obvious what had happened. The PATRON<br>was short of money, and he had engaged the staff (there were four of us) in<br>order to use us instead of workmen. He would be getting our services almost<br>free, for waiters are paid no wages, and though he would have to pay me, he<br>would not be feeding me till the restaurant opened. In effect, he had<br>swindled us of several hundred francs by sending for us before the<br>restaurant was open. We had thrown up a good job for nothing.<br><br>Boris, however, was full of hope. He had only one idea in his head,<br>namely, that here at last was a chance of being a waiter and wearing a tail<br>coat once more. For this he was quite willing to do ten days' work unpaid,<br>with the chance of being left jobless in the end. 'Patience!' he kept<br>saying. 'That will arrange itself. Wait till the restaurant opens, and<br>we'll get it all back. Patience, MON AMI!'<br><br>We needed patience, for days passed and the restaurant did not even<br>progress towards opening. We cleaned out the cellars, fixed the shelves,<br>distempered the walls, polished the woodwork, whitewashed the ceiling,<br>stained the floor; but the main work, the plumbing and gas-fitting and<br>electricity, was still not done, because the PATRON could not pay the<br>bills. Evidently he was almost penniless, for he refused the smallest<br>charges, and he had a trick of swiftly disappearing when asked for money.<br>His blend of shiftiness and aristocratic manners made him very hard to deal<br>with. Melancholy duns came looking for him at all hours, and by instruction<br>we always told them that he was at Fontainebleau, or Saint Cloud, or some<br>other place that was safely distant. Meanwhile, I was getting hungrier and<br>hungrier. I had left the hotel with thirty francs, and I had to go back<br>immediately to a diet of dry bread. Boris had managed in the beginning to<br>extract an advance of sixty francs from the PATRON, but he had spent half<br>of it, in redeeming his waiter's clothes, and half on the girl of<br>sympathetic temperament. He borrowed three francs a day from Jules, the<br>second waiter, and spent it on bread. Some days we had not even money for<br>tobacco.<br><br>Sometimes the cook came to see how things were getting on, and when<br>she saw that the kitchen was still bare of pots and pans she usually wept.<br>Jules, the second waiter, refused steadily to help with the work. He was a<br>Magyar, a little dark, sharp-featured fellow in spectacles, and very<br>talkative; he had been a medical student, but had abandoned his training<br>for lack of money. He had a taste for talking while other people were<br>working, and he told me all about himself and his ideas. It appeared that<br>he was a Communist, and had various strange theories (he could prove to you<br>by figures that it was wrong to work), and he was also, like most Magyars,<br>passionately proud. Proud and lazy men do not make good waiters. It was<br>Jules's dearest boast that once when a customer in a restaurant had<br>insulted him, he had poured a plate of hot soup down the customer's neck,<br>and then walked straight out without even waiting to be sacked.<br><br>As each day went by Jules grew more and more enraged at the trick the<br>PATRON had played on us. He had a spluttering, oratorical way of talking.<br>He used to walk up and down shaking his fist, and trying to incite me not<br>to work:<br><br>'Put that brush down, you fool! You and I belong to proud races; we<br>don't work for nothing, like these damned Russian serfs. I tell you, to be<br>cheated like this is torture to me. There have been times in my life, when<br>someone has cheated me even of five sous, when I have vomited--yes,<br>vomited with rage.<br><br>'Besides, MON VIEUX, don't forget that I'm a Communist. A BAS LA<br>BOURGEOISIE! Did any man alive ever see me working when I could avoid it?<br>No. And not only I don't wear myself out working, like you other fools, but<br>I steal, just to show my independence. Once I was in a restaurant where the<br>PATRON thought he could treat me like a dog. Well, in revenge I found out a<br>way to steal milk from the milk-cans and seal them up again so that no one<br>should know. I tell you I just swilled that milk down night and morning.<br>Every day I drank four litres of milk, besides half a litre of cream. The<br>PATRON was at his wits' end to know where the milk was going. It wasn't<br>that I wanted milk, you understand, because I hate the stuff; it was<br>principle, just principle.<br><br>'Well, after three days I began to get dreadful pains in my belly, and<br>I went to the doctor. "What have you been eating?" he said. I said: "I<br>drink four litres of milk a day, and half a litre of cream." "Four litres!"<br>he said. "Then stop it at once. You'll burst if you go on." "What do I<br>care?" I said. "With me principle is everything. I shall go on drinking<br>that milk, even if I do burst."<br><br>'Well, the next day the PATRON caught me stealing milk. "You're<br>sacked," he said; "you leave at the end of the week." "PARDON, MONSIEUR," I<br>said, "I shall leave this morning." "No, you won't," he said, "I can't<br>spare you till Saturday." "Very well, MON PATRON," I thought to myself,<br>"we'll see who gets tired of it first." And then I set to work to smash the<br>crockery. I broke nine plates the first day and thirteen the second; after<br>that the PATRON was glad to see the last of me.<br><br>'Ah, I'm not one of your Russian MOUJIKS...'<br><br>Ten days passed. It was a bad time. I was absolutely at the end of my<br>money, and my rent was several days overdue. We loafed about the dismal<br>empty restaurant, too hungry even to get on with the work that remained.<br>Only Boris now believed that the restaurant would open. He had set his<br>heart on being MAITRE D'HOTEL, and he invented a theory that the PATRON'S<br>money was tied up in shares and he was waiting a favourable moment for<br>selling. On the tenth day I had nothing to eat or smoke, and I told the<br>PATRON that I could not continue working without an advance on my wages. As<br>blandly as usual, the PATRON promised the advance, and then, according to<br>his custom, vanished. I walked part of the way home, but I did not feel<br>equal to a scene with Madame F. over the rent, so I passed the night on a<br>bench on the boulevard. It was very uncomfortable--the arm of the seat<br>cuts into your back--and much colder than I had expected. There was<br>plenty of time, in the long boring hours between dawn and work, to think<br>what a fool I had been to deliver myself into the hands of these Russians.<br><br>Then, in the morning, the luck changed. Evidently the PATRON had come<br>to an understanding with his creditors, for he arrived with money in his<br>pockets, set the alterations going, and gave me my advance. Boris and I<br>bought macaroni and a piece of horse's liver, and had our first hot meal in<br>ten days.<br><br>The workmen were brought in and the alterations made, hastily and with<br>incredible shoddiness. The tables, for instance, were to be covered with<br>baize, but when the PATRON found that baize was expensive he bought instead<br>disused army blankets, smelling incorrigibly of sweat. The table cloths<br>(they were check, to go with the 'Norman' decorations) would cover them, of<br>course. On the last night we were at work till two in the morning, getting<br>things ready. The crockery did not arrive till eight, and, being new, had<br>all to be washed. The cutlery did not arrive till the next morning, nor the<br>linen either, so that we had to dry the crockery with a shirt of the<br>PATRON's and an old pillowslip belonging to the concierge. Boris and I did<br>all the work. Jules was skulking, and the PATRON and his wife sat in the<br>bar with a dun and some Russian friends, drinking success to the<br>restaurant. The cook was in the kitchen with her head on the table, crying,<br>because she was expected to cook for fifty people, and there were not pots<br>and pans enough for ten. About midnight there was a fearful interview with<br>some duns, who came intending to seize eight copper saucepans which the<br>PATRON had obtained on credit. They were bought off with half a bottle of<br>brandy.<br><br>Jules and I missed the last Metro home and had to sleep on the floor<br>of the restaurant. The first thing we saw in the morning were two large<br>rats sitting on the kitchen table, eating from a ham that stood there. It<br>seemed a bad omen, and I was surer than ever that the Auberge de Jehan<br>Cottard would turn out a failure.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/17.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/19.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
