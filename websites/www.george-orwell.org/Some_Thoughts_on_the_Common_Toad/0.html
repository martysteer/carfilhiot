<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Before the swallow, before the daffodil, and not much later than the<br>snowdrop, the common toad salutes the coming of spring after his own<br>fashion, which is to emerge from a hole in the ground, where he has lain<br>buried since the previous autumn, and crawl as rapidly as possible<br>towards the nearest suitable patch of water. Something--some kind of<br>shudder in the earth, or perhaps merely a rise of a few degrees in the<br>temperature--has told him that it is time to wake up: though a few toads<br>appear to sleep the clock round and miss out a year from time to time--<br>at any rate, I have more than once dug them up, alive and apparently<br>well, in the middle of the summer.<br><br>At this period, after his long fast, the toad has a very spiritual look,<br>like a strict Anglo-Catholic towards the end of Lent. His movements are<br>languid but purposeful, his body is shrunken, and by contrast his eyes<br>look abnormally large. This allows one to notice, what one might not at<br>another time, that a toad has about the most beautiful eye of any living<br>creature. It is like gold, or more exactly it is like the golden-coloured<br>semi-precious stone which one sometimes sees in signet-rings, and which I<br>think is called a chrysoberyl.<br><br>For a few days after getting into the water the toad concentrates on<br>building up his strength by eating small insects. Presently he has<br>swollen to his normal size again, and then he hoes through a phase of<br>intense sexiness. All he knows, at least if he is a male toad, is that he<br>wants to get his arms round something, and if you offer him a stick, or<br>even your finger, he will cling to it with surprising strength and take a<br>long time to discover that it is not a female toad. Frequently one comes<br>upon shapeless masses of ten or twenty toads rolling over and over in the<br>water, one clinging to another without distinction of sex. By degrees,<br>however, they sort themselves out into couples, with the male duly<br>sitting on the female's back. You can now distinguish males from females,<br>because the male is smaller, darker and sits on top, with his arms<br>tightly clasped round the female's neck. After a day or two the spawn is<br>laid in long strings which wind themselves in and out of the reeds and<br>soon become invisible. A few more weeks, and the water is alive with<br>masses of tiny tadpoles which rapidly grow larger, sprout hind-legs, then<br>forelegs, then shed their tails: and finally, about the middle of the<br>summer, the new generation of toads, smaller than one's thumb-nail but<br>perfect in every particular, crawl out of the water to begin the game<br>anew.<br><br>I mention the spawning of the toads because it is one of the phenomena of<br>spring which most deeply appeal to me, and because the toad, unlike the<br>skylark and the primrose, has never had much of a boost from poets. But I<br>am aware that many people do not like reptiles or amphibians, and I am<br>not suggesting that in order to enjoy the spring you have to take an<br>interest in toads. There are also the crocus, the missel-thrush, the<br>cuckoo, the blackthorn, etc. The point is that the pleasures of spring<br>are available to everybody, and cost nothing. Even in the most sordid<br>street the coming of spring will register itself by some sign or other,<br>if it is only a brighter blue between the chimney pots or the vivid green<br>of an elder sprouting on a blitzed site. Indeed it is remarkable how<br>Nature goes on existing unofficially, as it were, in the very heart of<br>London. I have seen a kestrel flying over the Deptford gasworks, and I<br>have heard a first-rate performance by a blackbird in the Euston Road.<br>There must be some hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of birds<br>living inside the four-mile radius, and it is rather a pleasing thought<br>that none of them pays a halfpenny of rent.<br><br>As for spring, not even the narrow and gloomy streets round the Bank of<br>England are quite able to exclude it. It comes seeping in everywhere,<br>like one of those new poison gases which pass through all filters. The<br>spring is commonly referred to as "a miracle", and during the past five<br>or six years this worn-out figure of speech has taken on a new lease of<br>life. After the sorts of winters we have had to endure recently, the<br>spring does seem miraculous, because it has become gradually harder and<br>harder to believe that it is actually going to happen. Every February<br>since 1940 I have found myself thinking that this time winter is going to<br>be permanent. But Persephone, like the toads, always rises from the dead<br>at about the same moment. Suddenly, towards the end of March, the miracle<br>happens and the decaying slum in which I live is transfigured. Down in<br>the square the sooty privets have turned bright green, the leaves are<br>thickening on the chestnut trees, the daffodils are out, the wallflowers<br>are budding, the policeman's tunic looks positively a pleasant shade of<br>blue, the fishmonger greets his customers with a smile, and even the<br>sparrows are quite a different colour, having felt the balminess of the<br>air and nerved themselves to take a bath, their first since last<br>September.<br><br>Is it wicked to take a pleasure in spring and other seasonal changes? To<br>put it more precisely, is it politically reprehensible, while we are all<br>groaning, or at any rate ought to be groaning, under the shackles of the<br>capitalist system, to point out that life is frequently more worth living<br>because of a blackbird's song, a yellow elm tree in October, or some<br>other natural phenomenon which does not cost money and does not have what<br>the editors of left-wing newspapers call a class angle? There is not<br>doubt that many people think so. I know by experience that a favourable<br>reference to "Nature" in one of my articles is liable to bring me abusive<br>letters, and though the key-word in these letters is usually<br>"sentimental", two ideas seem to be mixed up in them. One is that any<br>pleasure in the actual process of life encourages a sort of political<br>quietism. People, so the thought runs, ought to be discontented, and it<br>is our job to multiply our wants and not simply to increase our enjoyment<br>of the things we have already. The other idea is that this is the age of<br>machines and that to dislike the machine, or even to want to limit its<br>domination, is backward-looking, reactionary and slightly ridiculous.<br>This is often backed up by the statement that a love of Nature is a<br>foible of urbanized people who have no notion what Nature is really like.<br>Those who really have to deal with the soil, so it is argued, do not love<br>the soil, and do not take the faintest interest in birds or flowers,<br>except from a strictly utilitarian point of view. To love the country one<br>must live in the town, merely taking an occasional week-end ramble at the<br>warmer times of year.<br><br>This last idea is demonstrably false. Medieval literature, for instance,<br>including the popular ballads, is full of an almost Georgian enthusiasm<br>for Nature, and the art of agricultural peoples such as the Chinese and<br>Japanese centre always round trees, birds, flowers, rivers, mountains.<br>The other idea seems to me to be wrong in a subtler way. Certainly we<br>ought to be discontented, we ought not simply to find out ways of making<br>the best of a bad job, and yet if we kill all pleasure in the actual<br>process of life, what sort of future are we preparing for ourselves? If a<br>man cannot enjoy the return of spring, why should he be happy in a<br>labour-saving Utopia? What will he do with the leisure that the machine<br>will give him? I have always suspected that if our economic and political<br>problems are ever really solved, life will become simpler instead of more<br>complex, and that the sort of pleasure one gets from finding the first<br>primrose will loom larger than the sort of pleasure one gets from eating<br>an ice to the tune of a Wurlitzer. I think that by retaining one's<br>childhood love of such things as trees, fishes, butterflies and--to<br>return to my first instance--toads, one makes a peaceful and decent<br>future a little more probable, and that by preaching the doctrine that<br>nothing is to be admired except steel and concrete, one merely makes it a<br>little surer that human beings will have no outlet for their surplus<br>energy except in hatred and leader worship.<br><br>At any rate, spring is here, even in London N.1, and they can't stop you<br>enjoying it. This is a satisfying reflection. How many a time have I<br>stood watching the toads mating, or a pair of hares having a boxing match<br>in the young corn, and thought of all the important persons who as you<br>are not actually ill, hungry, frightened or immured in a prison or a<br>holiday camp, spring is still spring. The atom bombs are piling up in the<br>factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are<br>streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the<br>sun, and neither the dictators nor the bureaucrats, deeply as they<br>disapprove of the process, are able to prevent it.<br><br></font></p>
