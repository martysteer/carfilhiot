<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In March or April, say the wiseacres, there is to be a stupendous<br>knockout blow at Britain. . . . What Hitler has to do it with, I cannot<br>imagine. His ebbing and dispersed military resources are now probably<br>not so very much greater than the Italians' before they were put to the<br>test in Greece and Africa."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The German air power has been largely spent. It is behind the times<br>and its first-rate men are mostly dead or disheartened or worn out."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In 1914 the Hohenzollern army was the best in the world. Behind that<br>screaming little defective in Berlin there is nothing of the sort. . . .<br>Yet our military 'experts' discuss the waiting phantom. In their<br>imaginations it is perfect in its equipment and invincible in<br>discipline. Sometimes it is to strike a decisive 'blow' through Spain<br>and North Africa and on, or march through the Balkans, march from the<br>Danube to Ankara, to Persia, to India, or 'crush Russia', or 'pour' over<br>the Brenner into Italy. The weeks pass and the phantom does none of<br>these things--for one excellent reason. It does not exist to that<br>extent. Most of such inadequate guns and munitions as it possessed must<br>have been taken away from it and fooled away in Hitler's silly feints to<br>invade Britain. And its raw jerry-built discipline is wilting under the<br>creeping realisation that the Blitzkrieg is spent, and the war is coming<br>home to roost."<br><br><br>These quotations are not taken from the CAVALRY QUARTERLY but from a<br>series of newspaper articles by Mr H.G. Wells, written at the beginning<br>of this year and now reprinted in a book entitled GUIDE TO THE NEW<br>WORLD. Since they were written, the German army has overrun the Balkans<br>and reconquered Cyrenaica, it can march through Turkey or Spain at such<br>time as may suit it, and it has undertaken the invasion of Russia. How<br>that campaign will turn out I do not know, but it is worth noticing that<br>the German general staff, whose opinion is probably worth something,<br>would not have begun it if they had not felt fairly certain of finishing<br>it within three months. So much for the idea that the German army is a<br>bogey, its equipment inadequate, its morale breaking down, etc etc.<br><br>What has Wells to set against the "screaming little defective in<br>Berlin"? The usual rigmarole about a World State, plus the Sankey<br>Declaration, which is an attempted definition of fundamental human<br>rights, of anti-totalitarian tendency. Except that he is now especially<br>concerned with federal world control of air power, it is the same gospel<br>as he has been preaching almost without interruption for the past forty<br>years, always with an air of angry surprise at the human beings who can<br>fail to grasp anything so obvious.<br><br>What is the use of saying that we need federal world control of the air?<br>The whole question is how we are to get it. What is the use of pointing<br>out that a World State is desirable? What matters is that not one of the<br>five great military powers would think of submitting to such a thing.<br>All sensible men for decades past have been substantially in agreement<br>with what Mr Wells says; but the sensible men have no power and, in too<br>many cases, no disposition to sacrifice themselves. Hitler is a criminal<br>lunatic, and Hitler has an army of millions of men, aeroplanes in<br>thousands, tanks in tens of thousands. For his sake a great nation has<br>been willing to overwork itself for six years and then to fight for two<br>years more, whereas for the commonsense, essentially hedonistic<br>world-view which Mr Wells puts forward, hardly a human creature is<br>willing to shed a pint of blood. Before you can even talk of world<br>reconstruction, or even of peace, you have got to eliminate Hitler,<br>which means bringing into being a dynamic not necessarily the same as<br>that of the Nazis, but probably quite as unacceptable to "enlightened"<br>and hedonistic people. What has kept England on its feet during the past<br>year? In part, no doubt, some vague idea about a better future, but<br>chiefly the atavistic emotion of patriotism, the ingrained feeling of<br>the English-speaking peoples that they are superior to foreigners. For<br>the last twenty years the main object of English left-wing intellectuals<br>has been to break this feeling down, and if they had succeeded, we might<br>be watching the SS men patrolling the London streets at this moment.<br>Similarly, why are the Russians fighting like tigers against the German<br>invasion? In part, perhaps, for some half-remembered ideal of Utopian<br>Socialism, but chiefly in defence of Holy Russia (the "sacred soil of<br>the Fatherland", etc etc), which Stalin has revived in an only slightly<br>altered form. The energy that actually shapes the world springs from<br>emotions--racial pride, leader-worship, religious belief, love of<br>war--which liberal intellectuals mechanically write off as anachronisms,<br>and which they have usually destroyed so completely in themselves as to<br>have lost all power of action.<br><br>The people who say that Hitler is Antichrist, or alternatively, the Holy<br>Ghost, are nearer an understanding of the truth than the intellectuals<br>who for ten dreadful years have kept it up that he is merely a figure<br>out of comic opera, not worth taking seriously. All that this idea<br>really reflects is the sheltered conditions of English life. The Left<br>Book Club was at bottom a product of Scotland Yard, just as the Peace<br>Pledge Union is a product of the navy. One development of the last ten<br>years has been the appearance of the "political book", a sort of<br>enlarged pamphlet combining history with political criticism, as an<br>important literary form. But the best writers in this line--Trotsky,<br>Rauschning, Rosenberg, Silone, Borkenau, Koestler and others--have none<br>of them been Englishmen, and nearly all of them have been renegades from<br>one or other extremist party, who have seen totalitarianism at close<br>quarters and known the meaning of exile and persecution. Only in the<br>English-speaking countries was it fashionable to believe, right up to the<br>outbreak of war, that Hitler was an unimportant lunatic and the German<br>tanks made of cardboard. Mr Wells, it will be seen from the quotations I<br>have given above, believes something of the kind still. I do not suppose<br>that either the bombs or the German campaign in Greece have altered his<br>opinion. A lifelong habit of thought stands between him and an<br>understanding of Hitler's power.<br><br>Mr Wells, like Dickens, belongs to the non-military middle class. The<br>thunder of guns, the jingle of spurs, the catch in the throat when the<br>old flag goes by, leave him manifestly cold. He has an invincible hatred<br>of the fighting, hunting, swashbuckling side of life, symbolised in all<br>his early books by a violent propaganda against horses. The principal<br>villain of his OUTLINE OF HISTORY is the military adventurer, Napoleon.<br>If one looks through nearly any book that he has written in the last<br>forty years one finds the same idea constantly recurring: the supposed<br>antithesis between the man of science who is working towards a planned<br>World State and the reactionary who is trying to restore a disorderly<br>past. In novels, Utopias, essays, films, pamphlets, the antithesis crops<br>up, always more or less the same. On the one side science, order,<br>progress, internationalism, aeroplanes, steel, concrete, hygiene: on the<br>other side war, nationalism, religion, monarchy, peasants, Greek<br>professors, poets, horses. History as he sees it is a series of<br>victories won by the scientific man over the romantic man. Now, he is<br>probably right in assuming that a "reasonable", planned form of society,<br>with scientists rather than witch-doctors in control, will prevail<br>sooner or later, but that is a different matter from assuming that it is<br>just round the corner. There survives somewhere or other an interesting<br>controversy which took place between Wells and Churchill at the time of<br>the Russian Revolution. Wells accuses Churchill of not really believing<br>his own propaganda about the Bolsheviks being monsters dripping with<br>blood etc, but of merely fearing that they were going to introduce an<br>era of common sense and scientific control, in which flag-wavers like<br>Churchill himself would have no place. Churchill's estimate of the<br>Bolsheviks, however, was nearer the mark than Wells's. The early<br>Bolsheviks may have been angels or demons, according as one chooses to<br>regard them, but at any rate they were not sensible men. They were not<br>introducing a Wellsian Utopia but a Rule of the Saints, which, like the<br>English Rule of the Saints, was a military despotism enlivened by<br>witchcraft trials. The same misconception reappears in an inverted form<br>in Wells's attitude to the Nazis. Hitler is all the war-lords and<br>witchdoctors in history rolled into one. Therefore, argues Wells, he is<br>an absurdity, a ghost from the past, a creature doomed to disappear<br>almost immediately. But unfortunately the equation of science with<br>common sense does not really hold good. The aeroplane, which was looked<br>forward to as a civilising influence but in practice has hardly been<br>used except for dropping bombs, is the symbol of that fact. Modern<br>Germany is far more scientific than England, and far more barbarous.<br>Much of what Wells has imagined and worked for is physically there in<br>Nazi Germany. The order, the planning, the State encouragement of<br>science, the steel, the concrete, the aeroplanes, are all there, but all<br>in the service of ideas appropriate to the Stone Age. Science is<br>fighting on the side of superstition. But obviously it is impossible for<br>Wells to accept this. It would contradict the world-view on which his<br>own works are based. The war-lords and the witch-doctors MUST fail, the<br>common-sense World State, as seen by a nineteenth-century liberal whose<br>heart does not leap at the sound of bugles, MUST triumph. Treachery and<br>defeatism apart, Hitler CANNOT be a danger. That he should finally win<br>would be an impossible reversal of history, like a Jacobite restoration.<br><br>But is it not a sort of parricide for a person of my age (thirty-eight)<br>to find fault with H.G. Wells? Thinking people who were born about the<br>beginning of this century are in some sense Wells's own creation. How<br>much influence any mere writer has, and especially a "popular" writer<br>whose work takes effect quickly, is questionable, but I doubt whether<br>anyone who was writing books between 1900 and 1920, at any rate in the<br>English language, influenced the young so much. The minds of all of us,<br>and therefore the physical world, would be perceptibly different if<br>Wells had never existed. Only, just the singleness of mind, the one-sided<br>imagination that made him seem like an inspired prophet in the Edwardian<br>age, make him a shallow, inadequate thinker now. When Wells was young,<br>the antithesis between science and reaction was not false. Society was<br>ruled by narrow-minded, profoundly incurious people, predatory<br>businessmen, dull squires, bishops, politicians who could quote<br>Horace but had never heard of algebra. Science was faintly disreputable<br>and religious belief obligatory. Traditionalism, stupidity, snobbishness,<br>patriotism, superstition and love of war seemed to be all on the<br>same side; there was need of someone who could state the opposite<br>point of view. Back in the nineteen-hundreds it was a wonderful<br>experience for a boy to discover H.G. Wells. There you were, in a world<br>of pedants, clergymen and golfers, with your future employers exhorting<br>you to "get on or get out", your parents systematically warping your<br>sexual life, and your dull-witted schoolmasters sniggering over their<br>Latin tags; and here was this wonderful man who could tell you about the<br>inhabitants of the planets and the bottom of the sea, and who knew that<br>the future was not going to be what respectable people imagined. A<br>decade or so before aeroplanes were technically feasible Wells knew that<br>within a little while men would be able to fly. He knew that because he<br>himself wanted to be able to fly, and therefore felt sure that research<br>in that direction would continue. On the other hand, even when I was a<br>little boy, at a time when the Wright brothers had actually lifted their<br>machine off the ground for fifty-nine seconds, the generally accepted<br>opinion was that if God had meant us to fly He would have given us<br>wings. Up to 1914 Wells was in the main a true prophet. In physical<br>details his vision of the new world has been fulfilled to a surprising<br>extent.<br><br>But because he belonged to the nineteenth century and to a non-military<br>nation and class, he could not grasp the tremendous strength of the old<br>world which was symbolised in his mind by fox-hunting Tories. He was, and<br>still is, quite incapable of understanding that nationalism, religious<br>bigotry and feudal loyalty are far more powerful forces than what he<br>himself would describe as sanity. Creatures out of the Dark Ages have<br>come marching into the present, and if they are ghosts they are at any<br>rate ghosts which need a strong magic to lay them. The people who have<br>shown the best understanding of Fascism are either those who have<br>suffered under it or those who have a Fascist streak in themselves. A<br>crude book like THE IRON HEEL, written nearly thirty years ago, is a<br>truer prophecy of the future than either BRAVE NEW WORLD or THE SHAPE OF<br>THINGS TO COME. If one had to choose among Wells's own contemporaries a<br>writer who could stand towards him as a corrective, one might choose<br>Kipling, who was not deaf to the evil voices of power and military<br>"glory". Kipling would have understood the appeal of Hitler, or for that<br>matter of Stalin, whatever his attitude towards them might be. Wells is<br>too sane to understand the modern world. The succession of<br>lower-middle-class novels which are his greatest achievement stopped<br>short at the other war and never really began again, and since 1920 he<br>has squandered his talents in slaying paper dragons. But how much it is,<br>after all, to have any talents to squander.<br><br></font></p>
