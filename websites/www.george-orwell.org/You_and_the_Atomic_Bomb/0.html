<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Considering how likely we all are to be blown to pieces by it within the<br>next five years, the atomic bomb has not roused so much discussion as<br>might have been expected. The newspapers have published numerous<br>diagrams, not very helpful to the average man, of protons and neutrons<br>doing their stuff, and there has been much reiteration of the useless<br>statement that the bomb 'ought to be put under international control.'<br>But curiously little has been said, at any rate in print, about the<br>question that is of most urgent interest to all of us, namely: 'How<br>difficult are these things to manufacture?'<br><br>Such information as we--that is, the big public--possess on this<br>subject has come to us in a rather indirect way, apropos of President<br>Truman's decision not to hand over certain secrets to the USSR. Some<br>months ago, when the bomb was still only a rumour, there was a widespread<br>belief that splitting the atom was merely a problem for the physicists,<br>and that when they had solved it a new and devastating weapon would be<br>within reach of almost everybody. (At any moment, so the rumour went,<br>some lonely lunatic in a laboratory might blow civilisation to<br>smithereens, as easily as touching off a firework.)<br><br>Had that been true, the whole trend of history would have been abruptly<br>altered. The distinction between great states and small states would have<br>been wiped out, and the power of the State over the individual would have<br>been greatly weakened. However, it appears from President Truman's<br>remarks, and various comments that have been made on them, that the bomb<br>is fantastically expensive and that its manufacture demands an enormous<br>industrial effort, such as only three or four countries in the world are<br>capable of making. This point is of cardinal importance, because it may<br>mean that the discovery of the atomic bomb, so far from reversing<br>history, will simply intensify the trends which have been apparent for a<br>dozen years past.<br><br>It is a commonplace that the history of civilisation is largely the<br>history of weapons. In particular, the connection between the discovery<br>of gunpowder and the overthrow of feudalism by the bourgeoisie has been<br>pointed out over and over again. And though I have no doubt exceptions<br>can be brought forward, I think the following rule would be found<br>generally true: that ages in which the dominant weapon is expensive or<br>difficult to make will tend to be ages of despotism, whereas when the<br>dominant weapon is cheap and simple, the common people have a chance.<br>Thus, for example, thanks, battleships and bombing planes are inherently<br>tyrannical weapons, while rifles, muskets, long-bows and hand-grenades<br>are inherently democratic weapons. A complex weapon makes the strong<br>stronger, while a simple weapon--so long as there is no answer to it--<br>gives claws to the weak.<br><br>The great age of democracy and of national self-determination was the age<br>of the musket and the rifle. After the invention of the flintlock, and<br>before the invention of the percussion cap, the musket was a fairly<br>efficient weapon, and at the same time so simple that it could be<br>produced almost anywhere. Its combination of qualities made possible the<br>success of the American and French revolutions, and made a popular<br>insurrection a more serious business than it could be in our own day.<br>After the musket came the breech-loading rifle. This was a comparatively<br>complex thing, but it could still be produced in scores of countries, and<br>it was cheap, easily smuggled and economical of ammunition. Even the most<br>backward nation could always get hold of rifles from one source or<br>another, so that Boers, Bulgars, Abyssinians, Moroccans--even Tibetans--<br>could put up a fight for their independence, sometimes with success. But<br>thereafter every development in military technique has favoured the State<br>as against the individual, and the industrialised country as against the<br>backward one. There are fewer and fewer foci of power. Already, in 1939,<br>there were only five states capable of waging war on the grand scale, and<br>now there are only three--ultimately, perhaps, only two. This trend has<br>been obvious for years, and was pointed out by a few observers even<br>before 1914. The one thing that might reverse it is the discovery of a<br>weapon--or, to put it more broadly, of a method of fighting--not<br>dependent on huge concentrations of industrial plant.<br><br>From various symptoms one can infer that the Russians do not yet possess<br>the secret of making the atomic bomb; on the other hand, the consensus of<br>opinion seems to be that they will possess it within a few years. So we<br>have before us the prospect of two or three monstrous super-states, each<br>possessed of a weapon by which millions of people can be wiped out in a<br>few seconds, dividing the world between them. It has been rather hastily<br>assumed that this means bigger and bloodier wars, and perhaps an actual<br>end to the machine civilisation. But suppose--and really this the<br>likeliest development--that the surviving great nations make a tacit<br>agreement never to use the atomic bomb against one another? Suppose they<br>only use it, or the threat of it, against people who are unable to<br>retaliate? In that case we are back where we were before, the only<br>difference being that power is concentrated in still fewer hands and that<br>the outlook for subject peoples and oppressed classes is still more<br>hopeless.<br><br>When James Burnham wrote THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION it seemed probable to<br>many Americans that the Germans would win the European end of the war,<br>and it was therefore natural to assume that Germany and not Russia would<br>dominate the Eurasian land mass, while Japan would remain master of East<br>Asia. This was a miscalculation, but it does not affect the main<br>argument. For Burnham's geographical picture of the new world has turned<br>out to be correct. More and more obviously the surface of the earth is<br>being parceled off into three great empires, each self-contained and cut<br>off from contact with the outer world, and each ruled, under one disguise<br>or another, by a self-elected oligarchy. The haggling as to where the<br>frontiers are to be drawn is still going on, and will continue for some<br>years, and the third of the three super-states--East Asia, dominated by<br>China--is still potential rather than actual. But the general drift is<br>unmistakable, and every scientific discovery of recent years has<br>accelerated it.<br><br>We were once told that the aeroplane had 'abolished frontiers'; actually<br>it is only since the aeroplane became a serious weapon that frontiers<br>have become definitely impassable. The radio was once expected to promote<br>international understanding and co-operation; it has turned out to be a<br>means of insulating one nation from another. The atomic bomb may complete<br>the process by robbing the exploited classes and peoples of all power to<br>revolt, and at the same time putting the possessors of the bomb on a<br>basis of military equality. Unable to conquer one another, they are<br>likely to continue ruling the world between them, and it is difficult to<br>see how the balance can be upset except by slow and unpredictable<br>demographic changes.<br><br>For forty or fifty years past, Mr. H. G. Wells and others have been<br>warning us that man is in danger of destroying himself with his own<br>weapons, leaving the ants or some other gregarious species to take over.<br>Anyone who has seen the ruined cities of Germany will find this notion at<br>least thinkable. Nevertheless, looking at the world as a whole, the drift<br>for many decades has been not towards anarchy but towards the<br>reimposition of slavery. We may be heading not for general breakdown but<br>for an epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity. James<br>Burnham's theory has been much discussed, but few people have yet<br>considered its ideological implications--that is, the kind of<br>world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would<br>probably prevail in a state which was at once UNCONQUERABLE and in a<br>permanent state of 'cold war' with its neighbors.<br><br>Had the atomic bomb turned out to be something as cheap and easily<br>manufactured as a bicycle or an alarm clock, it might well have plunged<br>us back into barbarism, but it might, on the other hand, have meant the<br>end of national sovereignty and of the highly-centralised police state.<br>If, as seems to be the case, it is a rare and costly object as difficult<br>to produce as a battleship, it is likelier to put an end to large-scale<br>wars at the cost of prolonging indefinitely a 'peace that is no peace'. <br><br></font></p>
