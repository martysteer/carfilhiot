<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">1<br><br><br>First of all the physical memories, the sounds, the smells and the<br>surfaces of things.<br><br>It is curious that more vividly than anything that came afterwards in the<br>Spanish war I remember the week of so-called training that we received<br>before being sent to the front--the huge cavalry barracks in Barcelona<br>with its draughty stables and cobbled yards, the icy cold of the pump<br>where one washed, the filthy meals made tolerable by pannikins of wine,<br>the Trousered militia-women chopping firewood, and the roll-call in the<br>early mornings where my prosaic English name made a sort of comic<br>interlude among the resounding Spanish ones, Manuel Gonzalez, Pedro<br>Aguilar, Ramon Fenellosa, Roque Ballaster, Jaime Domenech, Sebastian<br>Viltron, Ramon Nuvo Bosch. I name those particular men because I remember<br>the faces of all of them. Except for two who were mere riff-raff and have<br>doubtless become good Falangists by this time, it is probable that all of<br>them are dead. Two of them I know to be dead. The eldest would have been<br>about twenty-five, the youngest sixteen.<br><br>One of the essential experiences of war is never being able to escape<br>from disgusting smells of human origin. Latrines are an overworked<br>subject in war literature, and I would not mention them if it were not<br>that the latrine in our barracks did its necessary bit towards puncturing<br>my own illusions about the Spanish civil war. The Latin type of latrine,<br>at which you have to squat, is bad enough at its best, but these were<br>made of some kind of polished stone so slippery that it was all you could<br>do to keep on your feet. In addition they were always blocked. Now I have<br>plenty of other disgusting things in my memory, but I believe it was<br>these latrines that first brought home to me the thought, so often to<br>recur: 'Here we are, soldiers of a revolutionary army, defending<br>Democracy against Fascism, fighting a war which is ABOUT something, and<br>the detail of our lives is just as sordid and degrading as it could be in<br>prison, let alone in a bourgeois army.' Many other things reinforced this<br>impression later; for instance, the boredom and animal hunger of trench<br>life, the squalid intrigues over scraps of food, the mean, nagging<br>quarrels which people exhausted by lack of sleep indulge in.<br><br>The essential horror of army life (whoever has been a soldier will know<br>what I mean by the essential horror of army life) is barely affected by<br>the nature of the war you happen to be fighting in. Discipline, for<br>instance, is ultimately the same in all armies. Orders have to be obeyed<br>and enforced by punishment if necessary, the relationship of officer and<br>man has to be the relationship of superior and inferior. The picture of<br>war set forth in books like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT is<br>substantially true. Bullets hurt, corpses stink, men under fire are often<br>so frightened that they wet their trousers. It is true that the social<br>background from which an army springs will colour its training, tactics<br>and general efficiency, and also that the consciousness of being in the<br>right can bolster up morale, though this affects the civilian population<br>more than the troops. (People forget that a soldier anywhere near the<br>front line is usually too hungry, or frightened, or cold, or, above all,<br>too tired to bother about the political origins of the war.) But the laws<br>of nature are not suspended for a 'red' army any more than for a 'white'<br>one. A louse is a louse and a bomb is a bomb, even though the cause you<br>are fighting for happens to be just.<br><br>Why is it worth while to point out anything so obvious? Because the bulk<br>of the British and American intelligentsia were manifestly unaware of it<br>then, and are now. Our memories are short nowadays, but look back a bit,<br>dig out the files of NEW MASSES or the DAILY WORKER, and just have a look<br>at the romantic warmongering muck that our left-wingers were spilling at<br>that time. All the stale old phrases! And the unimaginative callousness<br>of it! The sang-froid with which London faced the bombing of Madrid! Here<br>I am not bothering about the counter-propagandists of the Right, the<br>Lunns, Garvins ET HOC GENUS; they go without saying. But here were the<br>very people who for twenty years had hooted and jeered at the 'glory' of<br>war, at atrocity stories, at patriotism, even at physical courage, coming<br>out with stuff that with the alteration of a few names would have fitted<br>into the DAILY MAIL of 1918. If there was one thing that the British<br>intelligentsia were committed to, it was the debunking version of war,<br>the theory that war is all corpses and latrines and never leads to any<br>good result. Well, the same people who in 1933 sniggered pityingly if you<br>said that in certain circumstances you would fight for your country, in<br>1937 were denouncing you as a Trotsky-Fascist if you suggested that the<br>stories in NEW MASSES about freshly wounded men clamouring to get back<br>into the fighting might be exaggerated. And the Left intelligentsia made<br>their swing-over from 'War is hell' to 'War is glorious' not only with no<br>sense of incongruity but almost without any intervening stage. Later the<br>bulk of them were to make other transitions equally violent. There must<br>be a quite large number of people, a sort of central core of the<br>intelligentsia, who approved the 'King and Country' declaration in 1935,<br>shouted for a' firm line against Germany' in 1937, supported the People's<br>Convention in 1940, and are demanding a Second Front now.<br><br>As far as the mass of the people go, the extraordinary swings of opinion<br>which occur nowadays, the emotions which can be turned on and off like a<br>tap, are the result of newspaper and radio hypnosis. In the<br>intelligentsia I should say they result rather from money and mere<br>physical safety. At a given moment they may be 'pro-war' or 'anti-war',<br>but in either case they have no realistic picture of war in their minds.<br>When they enthused over the Spanish war they knew, of course, that people<br>were being killed and that to be killed is unpleasant, but they did feel<br>that for a soldier in the Spanish Republican army the experience of war<br>was somehow not degrading. Somehow the latrines stank less, discipline<br>was less irksome. You have only to glance at the NEW STATESMAN to see<br>that they believed that; exactly similar blah is being written about the<br>Red Army at this moment. We have become too civilized to grasp the<br>obvious. For the truth is very simple. To survive you often have to<br>fight, and to fight you have to dirty yourself. War is evil, and it is<br>often the lesser evil. Those who take the sword perish by the sword, and<br>those who don't take the sword perish by smelly diseases. The fact that<br>such a platitude is worth writing down shows what the years of RENTIER<br>capitalism have done to us.<br><br><br>2<br><br><br>In connexion with what I have just said, a footnote, on atrocities.<br><br>I have little direct evidence about the atrocities in the Spanish civil<br>war. I know that some were committed by the Republicans, and far more<br>(they are still continuing) by the Fascists. But what impressed me then,<br>and has impressed me ever since, is that atrocities are believed in or<br>disbelieved in solely on grounds of political predilection. Everyone<br>believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his<br>own side, without ever bothering to examine the evidence. Recently I drew<br>up a table of atrocities during the period between 1918 and the present;<br>there was never a year when atrocities were not occurring somewhere or<br>other, and there was hardly a single case when the Left and the Right<br>believed in the same stories simultaneously. And stranger yet, at any<br>moment the situation can suddenly reverse itself and yesterday's<br>proved-to-the-hilt atrocity story can become a ridiculous lie, merely<br>because the political landscape has changed.<br><br>In the present war we are in the curious situation that our 'atrocity<br>campaign' was done largely before the war started, and done mostly by the<br>Left, the people who normally pride themselves on their incredulity. In<br>the same period the Right, the atrocity-mongers of 1914-18, were gazing<br>at Nazi Germany and flatly refusing to see any evil in it. Then as soon<br>as war broke out it was the pro-Nazis of yesterday who were repeating<br>horror stories, while the anti-Nazis suddenly found themselves doubting<br>whether the Gestapo really existed. Nor was this solely the result of the<br>Russo-German Pact. It was partly because before the war the Left had<br>wrongly believed that Britain and Germany would never fight and were<br>therefore able to be anti-German and anti-British simultaneously; partly<br>also because official war-propaganda, with its disgusting hypocrisy and<br>self-righteousness, always tends to make thinking people sympathize with<br>the enemy. Part of the price we paid for the systematic lying of 1914-17<br>was the exaggerated pro-German reaction which followed. During the years<br>1918-33 you were hooted at in left-wing circles if you suggested that<br>Germany bore even a fraction of responsibility for the war. In all the<br>denunciations of Versailles I listened to during those years I don't<br>think I ever once heard the question, 'What would have happened if<br>Germany had won?' even mentioned, let alone discussed. So also with<br>atrocities. The truth, it is felt, becomes untruth when your enemy utters<br>it. Recently I noticed that the very people who swallowed any and every<br>horror story about the Japanese in Nanking in 1937 refused to believe<br>exactly the same stories about Hong Kong in 1942. There was even a<br>tendency to feel that the Nanking atrocities had become, as it were,<br>retrospectively untrue because the British Government now drew attention<br>to them.<br><br>But unfortunately the truth about atrocities is far worse than that they<br>are lied about and made into propaganda. The truth is that they happen.<br>The fact often adduced as a reason for scepticism--that the same horror<br>stories come up in war after war--merely makes it rather more likely<br>that these stories are true. Evidently they are widespread fantasies, and<br>war provides an opportunity of putting them into practice. Also, although<br>it has ceased to be fashionable to say so, there is little question that<br>what one may roughly call the 'whites' commit far more and worse<br>atrocities than the 'reds'. There is not the slightest doubt, for<br>instance, about the behaviour of the Japanese in China. Nor is there much<br>doubt about the long tale of Fascist outrages during the last ten years<br>in Europe. The volume of testimony is enormous, and a respectable<br>proportion of it comes from the German press and radio. These things<br>really happened, that is the thing to keep one's eye on. They happened<br>even though Lord Halifax said they happened. The raping and butchering in<br>Chinese cities, the tortures in the cellars of the Gestapo, the elderly<br>Jewish professors flung into cesspools, the machine-gunning of refugees<br>along the Spanish roads--they all happened, and they did not happen any<br>the less because the DAILY TELEGRAPH has suddenly found out about them<br>when it is five years too late.<br><br><br>3<br><br><br>Two memories, the first not proving anything in particular, the second, I<br>think, giving one a certain insight into the atmosphere of a<br>revolutionary period:<br><br>Early one morning another man and I had gone out to snipe at the Fascists<br>in the trenches outside Huesca. Their line and ours here lay three<br>hundred yards apart, at which range our aged rifles would not shoot<br>accurately, but by sneaking out to a spot about a hundred yards from the<br>Fascist trench you might, if you were lucky, get a shot at someone<br>through a gap in the parapet. Unfortunately the ground between was a flat<br>beet field with no cover except a few ditches, and it was necessary to go<br>out while it was still-dark and return soon after dawn, before the light<br>became too good. This time no Fascists appeared, and we stayed too long<br>and were caught by the dawn. We were in a ditch, but behind us were two<br>hundred yards of flat ground with hardly enough cover for a rabbit. We<br>were still trying to nerve ourselves to make a dash for it when there was<br>an uproar and a blowing of whistles in the Fascist trench. Some of our<br>aeroplanes were coming over. At this moment, a man presumably carrying a<br>message to an officer, jumped out of the trench and ran along the top of<br>the parapet in full view. He was half-dressed and was holding up his<br>trousers with both hands as he ran. I refrained from shooting at him. It<br>is true that I am a poor shot and unlikely to hit a running man at a<br>hundred yards, and also that I was thinking chiefly about getting back to<br>our trench while the Fascists had their attention fixed on the<br>aeroplanes. Still, I did not shoot partly because of that detail about<br>the trousers. I had come here to shoot at 'Fascists'; but a man who is<br>holding up his trousers isn't a 'Fascist', he is visibly a<br>fellow-creature, similar to yourself, and you don't feel like shooting at<br>him.<br><br>What does this incident demonstrate? Nothing very much, because it is the<br>kind of thing that happens all the time in all wars. The other is<br>different. I don't suppose that in telling it I can make it moving to you<br>who read it, but I ask you to believe that it is moving to me, as an<br>incident characteristic of the moral atmosphere of a particular moment in<br>time.<br><br>One of the recruits who joined us while I was at the barracks was a<br>wild-looking boy from the back streets of Barcelona. He was ragged and<br>barefooted. He was also extremely dark (Arab blood, I dare say), and made<br>gestures you do not usually see a European make; one in particular--the<br>arm outstretched, the palm vertical--was a gesture characteristic of<br>Indians. One day a bundle of cigars, which you could still buy dirt cheap<br>at that time, was stolen out of my bunk. Rather foolishly I reported this<br>to the officer, and one of the scallywags I have already mentioned<br>promptly came forward and said quite untruly that twenty-five pesetas had<br>been stolen from his bunk. For some reason the officer instantly decided<br>that the brown-faced boy must be the thief. They were very hard on<br>stealing in the militia, and in theory people could be shot for it. The<br>wretched boy allowed himself to be led off to the guardroom to be<br>searched. What most struck me was that he barely attempted to protest his<br>innocence. In the fatalism of his attitude you could see the desperate<br>poverty in which he had been bred. The officer ordered him to take his<br>clothes off. With a humility which was horrible to me he stripped himself<br>naked, and his clothes were searched. Of course neither the cigars nor<br>the money were there; in fact he had not stolen them. What was most<br>painful of all was that he seemed no less ashamed after his innocence had<br>been established. That night I took him to the pictures and gave him<br>brandy and chocolate. But that too was horrible--I mean the attempt to<br>wipe out an injury with money. For a few minutes I had half believed him<br>to be a thief, and that could not be wiped out.<br><br>Well, a few weeks later at the front I had trouble with one of the men in<br>my section. By this time I was a 'cabo', or corporal, in command of<br>twelve men. It was static warfare, horribly cold, and the chief job was<br>getting sentries to stay awake at their posts. One day a man suddenly<br>refused to go to a certain post, which he said quite truly was exposed to<br>enemy fire. He was a feeble creature, and I seized hold of him and began<br>to drag him towards his post. This roused the feelings of the others<br>against me, for Spaniards, I think, resent being touched more than we do.<br>Instantly I was surrounded by a ring of shouting men:' Fascist! Fascist!<br>Let that man go! This isn't a bourgeois army. Fascist!' etc., etc. As<br>best I could in my bad Spanish I shouted back that orders had got to be<br>obeyed, and the row developed into one of those enormous arguments by<br>means of which discipline is gradually hammered out in revolutionary<br>armies. Some said I was right, others said I was wrong. But the point is<br>that the one who took my side the most warmly of all was the brown-faced<br>boy. As soon as he saw what was happening he sprang into the ring and<br>began passionately defending me. With his strange, wild, Indian gesture<br>he kept exclaiming, 'He's the best corporal we've got!' (NO HAY CABO COMO<br>EL!) Later on he applied for leave to exchange into my section.<br><br>Why is this incident touching to me? Because in any normal circumstances<br>it would have been impossible for good feelings ever to be re-established<br>between this boy and myself. The implied accusation of theft would not<br>have been made any better, probably somewhat worse, by my efforts to make<br>amends. One of the effects of safe and civilized life is an immense<br>oversensitiveness which makes all the primary emotions seem somewhat<br>disgusting. Generosity is as painful as meanness, gratitude as hateful as<br>ingratitude. But in Spain in 1936 we were not living in a normal time. It<br>was a time when generous feelings and gestures were easier than they<br>ordinarily are. I could relate a dozen similar incidents, not really<br>communicable but bound up in my own mind with the special atmosphere of<br>the time, the shabby clothes and the gay-coloured revolutionary posters,<br>the universal use of the word 'comrade', the anti-Fascist ballads printed<br>on flimsy paper and sold for a penny, the phrases like 'international<br>proletarian solidarty', pathetically repeated by ignorant men who<br>believed them to mean something. Could you feel friendly towards<br>somebody, and stick up for him in a quarrel, after you had been<br>ignominiously searched in his presence for property you were supposed to<br>have stolen from him? No, you couldn't; but you might if you had both<br>been through some emotionally widening experience. That is one of the<br>by-products of revolution, though in this case it was only the beginnings<br>of a revolution, and obviously foredoomed to failure.<br><br><br>4<br><br><br>The struggle for power between the Spanish Republican parties is an<br>unhappy, far-off thing which I have no wish to revive at this date. I<br>only mention it in order to say: believe nothing, or next to nothing, of<br>what you read about internal affairs on the Government side. It is all,<br>from whatever source, party propaganda--that is to say, lies. The broad<br>truth about the war is simple enough. The Spanish bourgeoisie saw their<br>chance of crushing the labour movement, and took it, aided by the Nazis<br>and by the forces of reaction all over the world. It is doubtful whether<br>more than that will ever be established.<br><br>I remember saying once to Arthur Koestler, 'History stopped in 1936', at<br>which he nodded in immediate understanding. We were both thinking of<br>totalitarianism in general, but more particularly of the Spanish civil<br>war. Early in life I have noticed that no event is ever correctly<br>reported in a newspaper, but in Spain, for the first time, I saw<br>newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts, not even<br>the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie. I saw great battles<br>reported where there had been no fighting, and complete silence where<br>hundreds of men had been killed. I saw troops who had fought bravely<br>denounced as cowards and traitors, and others who had never seen a shot<br>fired hailed as the heroes of imaginary victories; and I saw newspapers<br>in London retailing these lies and eager intellectuals building emotional<br>superstructures over events that had never happened. I saw, in fact,<br>history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to<br>have happened according to various 'party lines'. Yet in a way, horrible<br>as all this was, it was unimportant. It concerned secondary issues--<br>namely, the struggle for power between the Comintern and the Spanish<br>left-wing parties, and the efforts of the Russian Government to prevent<br>revolution in Spain. But the broad picture of the war which the Spanish<br>Government presented to the world was not untruthful. The main issues<br>were what it said they were. But as for the Fascists and their backers,<br>how could they come even as near to the truth as that? How could they<br>possibly mention their real aims? Their version of the war was pure<br>fantasy, and in the circumstances it could not have been otherwise.<br><br>The only propaganda line open to the Nazis and Fascists was to represent<br>themselves as Christian patriots saving Spain from a Russian<br>dictatorship. This involved pretending that life in Government Spain was<br>just one long massacre (VIDE the CATHOLIC HERALD or the DAILY MAIL--but<br>these were child's play compared with the Continental Fascist press), and<br>it involved immensely exaggerating the scale of Russian intervention. Out<br>of the huge pyramid of lies which the Catholic and reactionary press all<br>over the world built up, let me take just one point--the presence in<br>Spain of a Russian army. Devout Franco partisans all believed in this;<br>estimates of its strength went as high as half a million. Now, there was<br>no Russian army in Spain. There may have been a handful of airmen and<br>other technicians, a few hundred at the most, but an army there was not.<br>Some thousands of foreigners who fought in Spain, not to mention millions<br>of Spaniards, were witnesses of this. Well, their testimony made no<br>impression at all upon the Franco propagandists, not one of whom had set<br>foot in Government Spain. Simultaneously these people refused utterly to<br>admit the fact of German or Italian intervention at the same time as the<br>Germany and Italian press were openly boasting about the exploits of<br>their' legionaries'. I have chosen to mention only one point, but in fact<br>the whole of Fascist propaganda about the war was on this level.<br><br>This kind of thing is frightening to me, because it often gives me the<br>feeling that the very concept of objective truth is fading out of the<br>world. After all, the chances are that those lies, or at any rate similar<br>lies, will pass into history. How will the history of the Spanish war be<br>written? If Franco remains in power his nominees will write the history<br>books, and (to stick to my chosen point) that Russian army which never<br>existed will become historical fact, and schoolchildren will learn about<br>it generations hence. But suppose Fascism is finally defeated and some<br>kind of democratic government restored in Spain in the fairly near<br>future; even then, how is the history of the war to be written? What kind<br>of records will Franco have left behind him? Suppose even that the<br>records kept on the Government side are recoverable--even so, how is a<br>true history of the war to be written? For, as I have pointed out<br>already, the Government, also dealt extensively in lies. From the<br>anti-Fascist angle one could write a broadly truthful history of the war,<br>but it would be a partisan history, unreliable on every minor point. Yet,<br>after all, some kind of history will be written, and after those who<br>actually remember the war are dead, it will be universally accepted. So<br>for all practical purposes the lie will have become truth.<br><br>I know it is the fashion to say that most of recorded history is lies<br>anyway. I am willing to believe that history is for the most part<br>inaccurate and biased, but what is peculiar to our own age is the<br>abandonment of the idea that history COULD be truthfully written. In the<br>past people deliberately lied, or they unconsciously coloured what they<br>wrote, or they struggled after the truth, well knowing that they must<br>make many mistakes; but in each case they believed that 'facts' existed<br>and were more or less discoverable. And in practice there was always a<br>considerable body of fact which would have been agreed to by almost<br>everyone. If you look up the history of the last war in, for instance,<br>the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA, you will find that a respectable amount of<br>the material is drawn from German sources. A British and a German<br>historian would disagree deeply on many things, even on fundamentals, but<br>there would still be that body of, as it were, neutral fact on which<br>neither would seriously challenge the other. It is just this common basis<br>of agreement, with its implication that human beings are all one species<br>of animal, that totalitarianism destroys. Nazi theory indeed specifically<br>denies that such a thing as 'the truth' exists. There is, for instance,<br>no such thing as 'Science'. There is only 'German Science', 'Jewish<br>Science', etc. The implied objective of this line of thought is a<br>nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique, controls not<br>only the future but THE PAST. If the Leader says of such and such an<br>event, 'It never happened'--well, it never happened. If he says that two<br>and two are five--well, two and two are five. This prospect frightens me<br>much more than bombs--and after our experiences of the last few years<br>that is not a frivolous statement.<br><br>But is it perhaps childish or morbid to terrify oneself with visions of a<br>totalitarian future? Before writing off the totalitarian world as a<br>nightmare that can't come true, just remember that in 1925 the world of<br>today would have seemed a nightmare that couldn't come true. Against that<br>shifting phantasmagoric world in which black may be white tomorrow and<br>yesterday's weather can be changed by decree, there are in reality only<br>two safeguards. One is that however much you deny the truth, the truth<br>goes on existing, as it were, behind your back, and you consequently<br>can't violate it in ways that impair military efficiency. The other is<br>that so long as some parts of the earth remain unconquered, the liberal<br>tradition can be kept alive. Let Fascism, or possibly even a combination<br>of several Fascisms, conquer the whole world, and those two conditions no<br>longer exist. We in England underrate the danger of this kind of thing,<br>because our traditions and our past security have given us a sentimental<br>belief that it all comes right in the end and the thing you most fear<br>never really happens. Nourished for hundreds of years on a literature in<br>which Right invariably triumphs in the last chapter, we believe<br>half-instinctively that evil always defeats itself in the long run.<br>Pacifism, for instance, is founded largely on this belief. Don't resist<br>evil, and it will somehow destroy itself. But why should it? What<br>evidence is there that it does? And what instance is there of a modern<br>industrialized state collapsing unless conquered from the outside by<br>military force?<br><br>Consider for instance the re-institution of slavery. Who could have<br>imagined twenty years ago that slavery would return to Europe? Well,<br>slavery has been restored under our noses. The forced-labour camps all<br>over Europe and North Africa where Poles, Russians, Jews and political<br>prisoners of every race toil at road-making or swamp-draining for their<br>bare rations, are simple chattle slavery. The most one can say is that<br>the buying and selling of slaves by individuals is not yet permitted. In<br>other ways--the breaking-up of families, for instance--the conditions<br>are probably worse than they were on the American cotton plantations.<br>There is no reason for thinking that this state of affairs will change<br>while any totalitarian domination endures. We don't grasp its full<br>implications, because in our mystical way we feel that a régime founded<br>on slavery MUST collapse. But it is worth comparing the duration of the<br>slave empires of antiquity with that of any modern state. Civilizations<br>founded on slavery have lasted for such periods as four thousand years.<br><br>When I think of antiquity, the detail that frightens me is that those<br>hundreds of millions of slaves on whose backs civilization rested<br>generation after generation have left behind them no record whatever. We<br>do not even know their names. In the whole of Greek and Roman history,<br>how many slaves' names are known to you? I can think of two, or possibly<br>three. One is Spartacus and the other is Epictetus. Also, in the Roman<br>room at the British Museum there is a glass jar with the maker's name<br>inscribed on the bottom, 'FELIX FECIT'. I have a mental picture of poor<br>Felix (a Gaul with red hair and a metal collar round his neck), but in<br>fact he may not have been a slave; so there are only two slaves whose<br>names I definitely know, and probably few people can remember more. The<br>rest have gone down into utter silence.<br><br><br>5<br><br><br>The backbone of the resistance against Franco was the Spanish working<br>class, especially the urban trade union members. In the long run--it is<br>important to remember that it is only in the long run--the working class<br>remains the most reliable enemy of Fascism, simply because the<br>working-class stands to gain most by a decent reconstruction of society.<br>Unlike other classes or categories, it can't be permanently bribed.<br><br>To say this is not to idealize the working class. In the long struggle<br>that has followed the Russian Revolution it is the manual workers who<br>have been defeated, and it is impossible not to feel that it was their<br>own fault. Time after time, in country after country, the organized<br>working-class movements have been crushed by open, illegal violence, and<br>their comrades abroad, linked to themin theoretical solidarity, have<br>simply looked on and done nothing; and underneath this, secret cause of<br>many betrayals, has lain the fact that between white and coloured workers<br>there is not even lip-service to solidarity. Who can believe in the<br>class-conscious international proletariat after the events of the past<br>ten years? To the British working class the massacre of their comrades in<br>Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, or wherever it might be seemed less interesting<br>and less important than yesterday's football match. Yet this does not<br>alter the fact that the working class will go on struggling against<br>Fascism after the others have caved in. One feature of the Nazi conquest<br>of France was the astonishing defections among the intelligentsia,<br>including some of the left-wing political intelligentsia. The<br>intelligentsia are the people who squeal loudest against Fascism, and yet<br>a respectable proportion of them collapse into defeatism when the pinch<br>comes. They are far-sighted enough to see the odds against them, and<br>moreoever they can be bribed--for it is evident that the Nazis think it<br>worth while to bribe intellectuals. With the working class it is the<br>other way about. Too ignorant to see through the trick that is being<br>played on them, they easily swallow the promises of Fascism, yet sooner<br>or later they always take up the struggle again. They must do so, because<br>in their own bodies they always discover that the promises of Fascism<br>cannot be fulfilled. To win over the working class permanently, the<br>Fascists would have to raise the general standard of living, which they<br>are unable and probably unwilling to do. The struggle of the working<br>class is like the growth of a plant. The plant is blind and stupid, but<br>it knows enough to keep pushing upwards towards the light, and it will do<br>this in the face of endless discouragements. What are the workers<br>struggling for? Simply for the decent life which they are more and more<br>aware is now technically possible. Their consciousness of this aim ebbs<br>and flows. In Spain, for a while, people were acting consciously, moving<br>towards a goal which they wanted to reach and believed they could reach.<br>It accounted for the curiously buoyant feeling that life in Government<br>Spain had during the early months of the war. The common people knew in<br>their bones that the Republic was their friend and Franco was their<br>enemy. They knew that they were in the right, because they were fighting<br>for something which the world owed them and was able to give them.<br><br>One has to remember this to see the Spanish war in its true perspective.<br>When one thinks of the cruelty, squalor, and futility of War--and in<br>this particular case of the intrigues, the persecutions, the lies and the<br>misunderstandings--there is always the temptation to say: 'One side is<br>as bad as the other. I am neutral'. In practice, however, one cannot be<br>neutral, and there is hardly such a thing as a war in which it makes no<br>difference who wins. Nearly always one stands more or less for progress,<br>the other side more or less for reaction. The hatred which the Spanish<br>Republic excited in millionaires, dukes, cardinals, play-boys, Blimps,<br>and what-not would in itself be enough to show one how the land lay. In<br>essence it was a class war. If it had been won, the cause of the common<br>people everywhere would have been strengthened. It was lost, and the<br>dividend-drawers all over the world rubbed their hands. That was the real<br>issue; all else was froth on its surface.<br><br><br>6<br><br><br>The outcome of the Spanish war was settled in London, Paris, Rome,<br>Berlin--at any rate not in Spain. After the summer of 1937 those with<br>eyes in their heads realized that the Government could not win the war<br>unless there were some profound change in the international set-up, and<br>in deciding to fight on Negrin and the others may have been partly<br>influenced by the expectation that the world war which actually broke out<br>in 1939 was coming in 1938. The much-publicized disunity on the<br>Government side was not a main cause of defeat. The Government militias<br>were hurriedly raised, ill-armed and unimaginative in their military<br>outlook, but they would have been the same if complete political<br>agreement had existed from the start. At the outbreak of war the average<br>Spanish factory-worker did not even know how to fire a rifle (there had<br>never been universal conscription in Spain), and the traditional pacifism<br>of the Left was a great handicap. The thousands of foreigners who served<br>in Spain made good infantry, but there were very few experts of any kind<br>among them. The Trotskyist thesis that the war could have been won if the<br>revolution had not been sabotaged was probably false. To nationalize<br>factories, demolish churches, and issue revolutionary manifestoes would<br>not have made the armies more efficient. The Fascists won because they<br>were the stronger; they had modern arms and the others hadn't. No<br>political strategy could offset that.<br><br>The most baffling thing in the Spanish war was the behaviour of the great<br>powers. The war was actually won for Franco by the Germans and Italians,<br>whose motives were obvious enough. The motives of France and Britain are<br>less easy to understand. In 1936 it was clear to everyone that if Britain<br>would only help the Spanish Government, even to the extent of a few<br>million pounds' worth of arms, Franco would collapse and German strategy<br>would be severely dislocated. By that time one did not need to be a<br>clairvoyant to foresee that war between Britain and Germany was coming;<br>one could even foretell within a year or two when it would come. Yet in<br>the most mean, cowardly, hypocritical way the British ruling class did<br>all they could to hand Spain over to Franco and the Nazis. Why? Because<br>they were pro-Fascist, was the obvious answer. Undoubtedly they were, and<br>yet when it came to the final showdown they chose to Stand up to Germany.<br>It is still very uncertain what plan they acted on in backing Franco, and<br>they may have had no clear plan at all. Whether the British ruling class<br>are wicked or merely stupid is one of the most difficult questions of our<br>time, and at certain moments a very important question. As to the<br>Russians, their motives in the Spanish war are completely inscrutable.<br>Did they, as the pinks believed, intervene in Spain in order to defend<br>Democracy and thwart the Nazis? Then why did they intervene on such a<br>niggardly scale and finally leave Spain in the lurch? Or did they, as the<br>Catholics maintained, intervene in order to foster revolution in Spain?<br>Then why did they do all in their power to crush the Spanish<br>revolutionary movements, defend private property and hand power to the<br>middle class as against the working class? Or did they, as the<br>Trotskyists suggested, intervene simply in order to PREVENT a Spanish<br>revolution? Then why not have backed Franco? Indeed, their actions are<br>most easily explained if one assumes that they were acting on several<br>contradictory motives. I believe that in the future we shall come to feel<br>that Stalin's foreign policy, instead of being so diabolically clever as<br>it is claimed to be, has been merely opportunistic and stupid. But at any<br>rate, the Spanish civil war demonstrated that the Nazis knew what they<br>were doing and their opponents did not. The war was fought at a low<br>technical level and its major strategy was very simple. That side which<br>had arms would win. The Nazis and the Italians gave arms to the Spanish<br>Fascist friends, and the western democracies and the Russians didn't give<br>arms to those who should have been their friends. So the Spanish Republic<br>perished, having' gained what no republic missed'.<br><br>Whether it was right, as all left-wingers in other countries undoubtedly<br>did, to encourage the Spaniards to go on fighting when they could not win<br>is a question hard to answer. I myself think it was right, because I<br>believe that it is better even from the point of view of survival to<br>fight and be conquered than to surrender without fighting. The effects on<br>the grand strategy of the struggle against Fascism cannot be assessed<br>yet. The ragged, weaponless armies of the Republic held out for two and a<br>half years, which was undoubtedly longer than their enemies expected. But<br>whether that dislocated the Fascist timetable, or whether, on the other<br>hand, it merely postponed the major war and gave the Nazis extra time to<br>get their war machine into trim, is still uncertain.<br><br><br>7<br><br><br>I never think of the Spanish war without two memories coming into my<br>mind. One is of the hospital ward at Lerida and the rather sad voices of<br>the wounded militiamen singing some song with a refrain that ended--<br><br><br>UNA RESOLUCION,<br>LUCHAR HAST' AL FIN!<br><br><br>Well, they fought to the end all right. For the last eighteen months of<br>the war the Republican armies must have been fighting almost without<br>cigarettes, and with precious little food. Even when I left Spain in the<br>middle of 1937, meat and bread were scarce, tobacco a rarity, coffee and<br>sugar almost unobtainable.<br><br>The other memory is of the Italian militiaman who shook my hand in the<br>guardroom, the day I joined the militia. I wrote about this man at the<br>beginning of my book on the Spanish war [Homage to Catalonia], and do not<br>want to repeat what I said there. When I remember--oh, how vividly!--his<br>shabby uniform and fierce, pathetic, innocent face, the complex side-issues<br>of the war seem to fade away and I see clearly that there was at any rate<br>no doubt as to who was in the right. In spite of power politics and<br>journalistic lying, the central issue of the war was the attempt of<br>people like this to win the decent life which they knew to be their<br>birthright. It is difficult to think of this particular man's probable<br>end without several kinds of bitterness. Since I met him in the Lenin<br>Barracks he was probably a Trotskyist or an Anarchist, and in the<br>peculiar conditions of our time, when people of that sort are not killed<br>by the Gestapo they are usually killed by the G.P.U. But that does not<br>affect the long-term issues. This man's face, which I saw only for a<br>minute or two, remains with me as a sort of visual reminder of what the<br>war was really about. He symbolizes for me the flower of the European<br>working class, harried by the police of all countries, the people who<br>fill the mass graves of the Spanish battlefields and are now, to the tune<br>of several millions, rotting in forced-labour camps.<br><br>When one thinks of all the people who support or have supported Fascism,<br>one stands amazed at their diversity. What a crew! Think of a programme<br>which at any rate for a while could bring Hitler, Petain, Montagu Norman,<br>Pavelitch, William Randolph Hearst, Streicher, Buchman, Ezra Pound, Juan<br>March, Cocteau, Thyssen, Father Coughlin, the Mufti of Jerusalem, Arnold<br>Lunn, Antonescu, Spengler, Beverley Nichols, Lady Houston, and Marinetti<br>all into the same boat! But the clue is really very simple. They are all<br>people with something to lose, or people who long for a hierarchical<br>society and dread the prospect of a world of free and equal human beings.<br>Behind all the ballyhoo that is talked about 'godless' Russia and the<br>'materialism' of the working class lies the simple intention of those<br>with money or privileges to cling to them. Ditto, though it contains a<br>partial truth, with all the talk about the worthlessness of social<br>reconstruction not accompanied by a 'change of heart'. The pious ones,<br>from the Pope to the yogis of California, are great on the' change of<br>heart', much more reassuring from their point of view than a change in<br>the economic system. Petain attributes the fall of France to the common<br>people's 'love of pleasure'. One sees this in its right perspective if<br>one stops to wonder how much pleasure the ordinary French peasant's or<br>working-man's life would contain compared with Pétain's own. The damned<br>impertinence of these politicians, priests, literary men, and what-not<br>who lecture the working-class socialist for his 'materialism'! All that<br>the working man demands is what these others would consider the<br>indispensable minimum without which human life cannot be lived at all.<br>Enough to eat, freedom from the haunting terror of unemployment, the<br>knowledge that your children will get a fair chance, a bath once a day,<br>clean linen reasonably often, a roof that doesn't leak, and short enough<br>working hours to leave you with a little energy when the day is done. Not<br>one of those who preach against 'materialism' would consider life livable<br>without these things. And how easily that minimum could be attained if we<br>chose to set our minds to it for only twenty years! To raise the standard<br>of living of the whole world to that of Britain would not be a greater<br>undertaking than the war we have just fought. I don't claim, and I don't<br>know who does, that that wouldn't solve anything in itself. It is merely<br>that privation and brute labour have to be abolished before the real<br>problems of humanity can be tackled. The major problem of our time is the<br>decay of the belief in personal immortality, and it cannot be dealt with<br>while the average human being is either drudging like an ox or shivering<br>in fear of the secret police. How right the working classes are in their<br>'materialism'! How right they are to realize that the belly comes before<br>the soul, not in the scale of values but in point of time! Understand<br>that, and the long horror that we are enduring becomes at least<br>intelligible. All the considerations are likely to make one falter--the<br>siren voices of a Pétain or of a Gandhi, the inescapable fact that in<br>order to fight one has to degrade oneself, the equivocal moral position<br>of Britain, with its democratic phrases and its coolie empire, the<br>sinister development of Soviet Russia, the squalid farce of left-wing<br>politics--all this fades away and one sees only the struggle of the<br>gradually awakening common people against the lords of property and their<br>hired liars and bumsuckers. The question is very simple. Shall people<br>like that Italian soldier be allowed to live the decent, fully human life<br>which is now technically achievable, or shan't they? Shall the common man<br>be pushed back into the mud, or shall he not? I myself believe, perhaps<br>on insufficient grounds, that the common man will win his fight sooner or<br>later, but I want it to be sooner and not later--some time within the<br>next hundred years, say, and not some time within the next ten thousand<br>years. That was the real issue of the Spanish war, and of the last war,<br>and perhaps of other wars yet to come.<br><br>I never saw the Italian militiaman again, nor did I ever learn his name.<br>It can be taken as quite certain that he is dead. Nearly two years later,<br>when the war was visibly lost, I wrote these verses in his memory:<br><br>The Italian soldier shook my hand<br>Beside the guard-room table;<br>The strong hand and the subtle hand<br>Whose palms are only able<br><br>To meet within the sound of guns,<br>But oh! what peace I knew then<br>In gazing on his battered face<br>Purer than any woman's!<br><br>For the flyblown words that make me spew<br>Still in his ears were holy,<br>And he was born knowing what I had learned<br>Out of books and slowly.<br><br>The treacherous guns had told their tale<br>And we both had bought it,<br>But my gold brick was made of gold--<br>Oh! who ever would have thought it?<br><br>Good luck go with you, Italian soldier!<br>But luck is not for the brave;<br>What would the world give back to you?<br>Always less than you gave.<br><br>Between the shadow and the ghost,<br>Between the white and the red,<br>Between the bullet and the lie,<br>Where would you hide your head?<br><br>For where is Manuel Gonzalez,<br>And where is Pedro Aguilar,<br>And where is Ramon Fenellosa?<br>The earthworms know where they are.<br><br>Your name and your deeds were forgotten<br>Before your bones were dry,<br>And the lie that slew you is buried<br>Under a deeper lie;<br><br>But the thing that I saw in your face<br>No power can disinherit:<br>No bomb that ever burst<br>Shatters the crystal spirit.<br><br></font></p>
