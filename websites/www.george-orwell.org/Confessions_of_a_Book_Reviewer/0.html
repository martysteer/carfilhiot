<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">In a cold but stuffy bed-sitting room littered with cigarette ends and<br>half-empty cups of tea, a man in a moth-eaten dressing-gown sits at a<br>rickety table, trying to find room for his typewriter among the piles of<br>dusty papers that surround it. He cannot throw the papers away because<br>the wastepaper basket is already overflowing, and besides, somewhere<br>among the unanswered letters and unpaid bills it is possible that there<br>is a cheque for two guineas which he is nearly certain he forgot to pay<br>into the bank. There are also letters with addresses which ought to be<br>entered in his address book. He has lost his address book, and the<br>thought of looking for it, or indeed of looking for anything, afflicts<br>him with acute suicidal impulses.<br><br>He is a man of 35, but looks 50. He is bald, has varicose veins and wears<br>spectacles, or would wear them if his only pair were not chronically<br>lost. If things are normal with him he will be suffering from<br>malnutrition, but if he has recently had a lucky streak he will be<br>suffering from a hangover. At present it is half-past eleven in the<br>morning, and according to his schedule he should have started work two<br>hours ago; but even if he had made any serious effort to start he would<br>have been frustrated by the almost continuous ringing of the telephone<br>bell, the yells of the baby, the rattle of an electric drill out in the<br>street, and the heavy boots of his creditors clumping up and down the<br>stairs. The most recent interruption was the arrival of the second post,<br>which brought him two circulars and an income tax demand printed in red.<br><br>Needless to say this person is a writer. He might be a poet, a novelist,<br>or a writer of film scripts or radio features, for all literary people<br>are very much alike, but let us say that he is a book reviewer. Half<br>hidden among the pile of papers is a bulky parcel containing five volumes<br>which his editor has sent with a note suggesting that they "ought to go<br>well together". They arrived four days ago, but for 48 hours the reviewer<br>was prevented by moral paralysis from opening the parcel. Yesterday in a<br>resolute moment he ripped the string off it and found the five volumes to<br>be PALESTINE AT THE CROSS ROADS, SCIENTIFIC DAIRY FARMING, A SHORT<br>HISTORY OF EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY (this one is 680 pages and weighs four<br>pounds), TRIBAL CUSTOMS IN PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA, and a novel, IT'S<br>NICER LYING DOWN, probably included by mistake. His review--800 words,<br>say--has got to be "in" by midday tomorrow.<br><br>Three of these books deal with subjects of which he is so ignorant that<br>he will have to read at least 50 pages if he is to avoid making some<br>howler which will betray him not merely to the author (who of course<br>knows all about the habits of book reviewers), but even to the general<br>reader. By four in the afternoon he will have taken the books out of<br>their wrapping paper but will still be suffering from a nervous inability<br>to open them. The prospect of having to read them, and even the smell of<br>the paper, affects him like the prospect of eating cold ground-rice<br>pudding flavoured with castor oil. And yet curiously enough his copy will<br>get to the office in time. Somehow it always does get there in time. At<br>about nine pm his mind will grow relatively clear, and until the small<br>hours he will sit in a room which grows colder and colder, while the<br>cigarette smoke grows thicker and thicker, skipping expertly through one<br>book after another and laying each down with the final comment, "God,<br>what tripe!" In the morning, blear-eyed, surly and unshaven, he will gaze<br>for an hour or two at a blank sheet of paper until the menacing finger of<br>the clock frightens him into action. Then suddenly he will snap into it.<br>All the stale old phrases--"a book that no one should miss", "something<br>memorable on every page", "of special value are the chapters dealing<br>with, etc etc"--will jump into their places like iron filings obeying the<br>magnet, and the review will end up at exactly the right length and with<br>just about three minutes to go. Meanwhile another wad of ill-assorted,<br>unappetising books will have arrived by post. So it goes on. And yet with<br>what high hopes this down-trodden, nerve-racked creature started his<br>career, only a few years ago.<br><br>Do I seem to exaggerate? I ask any regular reviewer--anyone who reviews,<br>say, a minimum of 100 books a year--whether he can deny in honesty that<br>his habits and character are such as I have described. Every writer, in<br>any case, is rather that kind of person, but the prolonged,<br>indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally thankless,<br>irritating and exhausting job. It not only involves praising trash--though<br>it does involve that, as I will show in a moment--but constantly INVENTING<br>reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings<br>whatever. The reviewer, jaded though he may be, is professionally<br>interested in books, and out of the thousands that appear annually, there<br>are probably fifty or a hundred that he would enjoy writing about. If he<br>is a top-notcher in his profession he may get hold of ten or twenty of<br>them: more probably he gets hold of two or three. The rest of his work,<br>however conscientious he may be in praising or damning, is in essence<br>humbug. He is pouring his immortal spirit down the drain, half a pint at<br>a time.<br><br>The great majority of reviews give an inadequate or misleading account of<br>the book that is dealt with. Since the war publishers have been less able<br>than before to twist the tails of literary editors and evoke a paean of<br>praise for every book that they produce, but on the other hand the<br>standard of reviewing has gone down owing to lack of space and other<br>inconveniences. Seeing the results, people sometimes suggest that the<br>solution lies in getting book reviewing out of the hands of hacks. Books<br>on specialised subjects ought to be dealt with by experts, and on the<br>other hand a good deal of reviewing, especially of novels, might well be<br>done by amateurs. Nearly every book is capable of arousing passionate<br>feeling, if it is only a passionate dislike, in some or other reader,<br>whose ideas about it would surely be worth more than those of a bored<br>professional. But, unfortunately, as every editor knows, that kind of<br>thing is very difficult to organise. In practice the editor always finds<br>himself reverting to his team of hacks--his "regulars", as he calls them.<br><br>None of this is remediable so long as it is taken for granted that every<br>book deserves to be reviewed. It is almost impossible to mention books in<br>bulk without grossly overpraising the great majority of them. Until one<br>has some kind of professional relationship with books one does not<br>discover how bad the majority of them are. In much more than nine cases<br>out of ten the only objectively truthful criticism would be "This book is<br>worthless", while the truth about the reviewer's own reaction would<br>probably be "This book does not interest me in any way, and I would not<br>write about it unless I were paid to." But the public will not pay to<br>read that kind of thing. Why should they? They want some kind of guide to<br>the books they are asked to read, and they want some kind of evaluation.<br>But as soon as values are mentioned, standards collapse. For if one<br>says--and nearly every reviewer says this kind of thing at least once a<br>week--that KING LEAR is a good play and THE FOUR JUST MEN is a good<br>thriller, what meaning is there in the word "good"?<br><br>The best practice, it has always seemed to me, would be simply to ignore<br>the great majority of books and to give very long reviews--1,000 words is<br>a bare minimum--to the few that seem to matter. Short notes of a line or<br>two on forthcoming books can be useful, but the usual middle-length review<br>of about 600 words is bound to be worthless even if the reviewer genuinely<br>wants to write it. Normally he doesn't want to write it, and the week-in,<br>week-out production of snippets soon reduces him to the crushed figure in<br>a dressing-gown whom I described at the beginning of this article.<br>However, everyone in this world has someone else whom he can look down<br>on, and I must say, from experience of both trades, that the book<br>reviewer is better off than the film critic, who cannot even do his work<br>at home, but has to attend trade shows at eleven in the morning and, with<br>one or two notable exceptions, is expected to sell his honour for a glass<br>of inferior sherry.<br><br></font></p>
