<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The position of the writer in an age of State control is a subject that<br>has already been fairly largely discussed, although most of the evidence<br>that might be relevant is not yet available. In this place I do not want<br>to express an opinion either for or against State patronage of the arts,<br>but merely to point out that WHAT KIND of State rules over us must<br>depend partly on the prevailing intellectual atmosphere: meaning, in<br>this context, partly on the attitude of writers and artists themselves,<br>and on their willingness or otherwise to keep the spirit of liberalism<br>alive. If we find ourselves in ten years' time cringing before somebody<br>like Zhdanov, it will probably be because that is what we have deserved.<br>Obviously there are strong tendencies towards totalitarianism at work<br>within the English literary intelligentsia already. But here I am not<br>concerned with any organised and conscious movement such as Communism,<br>but merely with the effect, on people of goodwill, of political thinking<br>and the need to take sides politically.<br><br>This is a political age. War, Fascism, concentration camps, rubber<br>truncheons, atomic bombs, etc are what we daily think about, and<br>therefore to a great extent what we write about, even when we do not<br>name them openly. We cannot help this. When you are on a sinking ship,<br>your thoughts will be about sinking ships. But not only is our<br>subject-matter narrowed, but our whole attitude towards literature is<br>coloured by loyalties which we at least intermittently realise to be<br>non-literary. I often have the feeling that even at the best of times<br>literary criticism is fraudulent, since in the absence of any accepted<br>standards whatever--any EXTERNAL reference which can give meaning to the<br>statement that such and such a book is "good" or "bad"--every literary<br>judgement consists in trumping up a set of rules to justify an<br>instinctive preference. One's real reaction to a book, when one has a<br>reaction at all, is usually "I like this book" or "I don't like it", and<br>what follows is a rationalisation. But "I like this book" is not, I<br>think, a non-literary reaction; the non-literary reaction is "This book<br>is on my side, and therefore I must discover merits in it". Of course,<br>when one praises a book for political reasons one may be emotionally<br>sincere, in the sense that one does feel strong approval of it, but also<br>it often happens that party solidarity demands a plain lie. Anyone used<br>to reviewing books for political periodicals is well aware of this. In<br>general, if you are writing for a paper that you are in agreement with,<br>you sin by commission, and if for a paper of the opposite stamp, by<br>omission. At any rate, innumerable controversial books-books for or<br>against Soviet Russia, for or against Zionism, for or against the<br>Catholic Church, etc--are judged before they are read, and in effect<br>before they are written. One knows in advance what reception they will<br>get in what papers. And yet, with a dishonesty that sometimes is not<br>even quarter-conscious, the pretence is kept up that genuinely literary<br>standards are being applied.<br><br>Of course, the invasion of literature by politics was bound to happen.<br>It must have happened, even if the special problem of totalitarianism<br>had never arisen, because we have developed a sort of compunction which<br>our grandparents did not have, an awareness of the enormous injustice<br>and misery of the world, and a guilt-stricken feeling that one ought to<br>be doing something about it, which makes a purely aesthetic attitude<br>towards life impossible. No one, now, could devote himself to literature<br>as single-mindedly as Joyce or Henry James. But unfortunately, to accept<br>political responsibility now means yielding oneself over to orthodoxies<br>and "party lines", with all the timidity and dishonesty that that<br>implies. As against the Victorian writers, we have the disadvantage of<br>living among clear-cut political ideologies and of usually knowing at a<br>glance what thoughts are heretical. A modern literary intellectual lives<br>and writes in constant dread--not, indeed, of public opinion in the wider<br>sense, but of public opinion within his own group. As a rule, luckily,<br>there is more than one group, but also at any given moment there is a<br>dominant orthodoxy, to offend against which needs a thick skin and<br>sometimes means cutting one's income in half for years on end.<br>Obviously, for about fifteen years past, the dominant orthodoxy,<br>especially among the young, has been "left". The key words are<br>"progressive", "democratic" and "revolutionary", while the labels which<br>you must at all costs avoid having gummed upon you are "bourgeois",<br>"reactionary" and "Fascist". Almost everyone nowadays, even the majority<br>of Catholics and Conservatives, is "progressive", or at least wishes to<br>be thought so. No one, so far as I know, ever describes himself as a<br>"bourgeois", just as no one literate enough to have heard the word ever<br>admits to being guilty of antisemitism. We are all of us good democrats,<br>anti-Fascist, anti-imperialist, contemptuous of class distinctions,<br>impervious to colour prejudice, and so on and so forth. Nor is there<br>much doubt that the present-day "left" orthodoxy is better than the<br>rather snobbish, pietistic Conservative orthodoxy which prevailed twenty<br>years ago, when the CRITERION and (on a lower level) the LONDON MERCURY<br>were the dominant literary magazines. For at the least its implied<br>objective is a viable form of society which large numbers of people<br>actually want. But it also has its own falsities which, because they<br>cannot be admitted, make it impossible for certain questions to be<br>seriously discussed.<br><br>The whole left-wing ideology, scientific and Utopian, was evolved by<br>people who had no immediate prospect of attaining power. It was,<br>therefore, an extremist ideology, utterly contemptuous of kings,<br>governments, laws, prisons, police forces, armies, flags, frontiers,<br>patriotism, religion, conventional morality, and, in fact, the whole<br>existing scheme of things. Until well within living memory the forces of<br>the Left in all countries were fighting against a tyranny which appeared<br>to be invincible, and it was easy to assume that if only THAT particular<br>tyranny--capitalism--could be overthrown, Socialism would follow.<br>Moreover, the Left had inherited from Liberalism certain distinctly<br>questionable beliefs, such as the belief that the truth will prevail and<br>persecution defeats itself, or that man is naturally good and is only<br>corrupted by his environment. This perfectionist ideology has persisted<br>in nearly all of us, and it is in the name of it that we protest when<br>(for instance) a Labour government votes huge incomes to the King's<br>daughters or shows hesitation about nationalising steel. But we have<br>also accumulated in our minds a whole series of unadmitted<br>contradictions, as a result of successive bumps against reality.<br><br>The first big bump was the Russian Revolution. For somewhat complex<br>reasons, nearly the whole of the English Left has been driven to accept<br>the Russian régime as "Socialist", while silently recognising that its<br>spirit and practice are quite alien to anything that is meant by<br>"Socialism" in this country. Hence there has arisen a sort of<br>schizophrenic manner of thinking, in which words like "democracy" can<br>bear two irreconcilable meanings, and such things as concentration camps<br>and mass deportations can be right and wrong simultaneously. The next<br>blow to the left-wing ideology was the rise of Fascism, which shook the<br>pacifism and internationalism of the Left without bringing about a<br>definite restatement of doctrine. The experience of German occupation<br>taught the European peoples something that the colonial peoples knew<br>already, namely, that class antagonisms are not all-important and that<br>there is such a thing as national interest. After Hitler it was<br>difficult to maintain seriously that "the enemy is in your own country"<br>and that national independence is of no value. But though we all know<br>this and act upon it when necessary, we still feel that to say it aloud<br>would be a kind of treachery. And finally, the greatest difficulty of<br>all, there is the fact that the Left is now in power and is obliged to<br>take responsibility and make genuine decisions.<br><br>Left governments almost invariably disappoint their supporters because,<br>even when the prosperity which they have promised is achievable, there<br>is always need of an uncomfortable transition period about which little<br>has been said beforehand. At this moment we see our own Government, in<br>its desperate economic straits, fighting in effect against its own past<br>propaganda. The crisis that we are now in is not a sudden unexpected<br>calamity, like an earthquake, and it was not caused by the war, but<br>merely hastened by it. Decades ago it could be foreseen that something<br>of this kind was going to happen. Ever since the nineteenth century our<br>national income, dependent partly on interest from foreign investments,<br>and on assured markets and cheap raw materials in colonial countries,<br>had been extremely precarious. It was certain that, sooner or later,<br>something would go wrong and we should be forced to make our exports<br>balance our imports: and when that happened the British standard of<br>living, including the working-class standard, was bound to fall, at least<br>temporarily. Yet the left-wing parties, even when they were vociferously<br>anti-imperialist, never made these facts clear. On occasion they were<br>ready to admit that the British workers had benefited, to some extent,<br>by the looting of Asia and Africa, but they always allowed it to appear<br>that we could give up our loot and yet in some way contrive to remain<br>prosperous. Quite largely, indeed, the workers were won over to<br>Socialism by being told that they were exploited, whereas the brute<br>truth was that, in world terms, they were exploiters. Now, to all<br>appearances, the point has been reached when the working-class<br>living-standard CANNOT be maintained, let alone raised. Even if we<br>squeeze the rich out of existence, the mass of the people must either<br>consume less or produce more. Or am I exaggerating the mess we are in? I<br>may be, and I should be glad to find myself mistaken. But the point I<br>wish to make is that this question, among people who are faithful to the<br>Left ideology, cannot be genuinely discussed. The lowering of wages and<br>raising of working hours are felt to be inherently anti-Socialist<br>measures, and must therefore be dismissed in advance, whatever the<br>economic situation may be. To suggest that they may be unavoidable is<br>merely to risk being plastered with those labels that we are all<br>terrified of. It is far safer to evade the issue and pretend that we can<br>put everything right by redistributing the existing national income.<br><br>To accept an orthodoxy is always to inherit unresolved contradictions.<br>Take for instance the fact that all sensitive people are revolted by<br>industrialism and its products, and yet are aware that the conquest of<br>poverty and the emancipation of the working class demand not less<br>industrialisation, but more and more. Or take the fact that certain jobs<br>are absolutely necessary and yet are never done except under some kind<br>of coercion. Or take the fact that it is impossible to have a positive<br>foreign policy without having powerful armed forces. One could multiply<br>examples. In every such case there is a conclusion which is perfectly<br>plain but which can only be drawn if one is privately disloyal to the<br>official ideology. The normal response is to push the question,<br>unanswered, into a corner of one's mind, and then continue repeating<br>contradictory catchwords. One does not have to search far through the<br>reviews and magazines to discover the effects of this kind of thinking.<br><br>I am not, of course, suggesting that mental dishonesty is peculiar to<br>Socialists and left-wingers generally, or is commonest among them. It is<br>merely that acceptance of ANY political discipline seems to be<br>incompatible with literary integrity. This applies equally to movements<br>like Pacifism and Personalism, which claim to be outside the ordinary<br>political struggle. Indeed, the mere sound of words ending in -ism seems<br>to bring with it the smell of propaganda. Group loyalties are necessary,<br>and yet they are poisonous to literature, so long as literature is the<br>product of individuals. As soon as they are allowed to have any<br>influence, even a negative one, on creative writing, the result is not<br>only falsification, but often the actual drying-up of the inventive<br>faculties.<br><br>Well, then what? Do we have to conclude that it is the duty of every<br>writer to "keep out of politics"? Certainly not! In any case, as I have<br>said already, no thinking person can or does genuinely keep out of<br>politics, in an age like the present one. I only suggest that we should<br>draw a sharper distinction than we do at present between our political<br>and our literary loyalties, and should recognise that a willingness to<br>DO certain distasteful but necessary things does not carry with it any<br>obligation to swallow the beliefs that usually go with them. When a<br>writer engages in politics he should do so as a citizen, as a human<br>being, but not AS A WRITER. I do not think that he has the right, merely<br>on the score of his sensibilities, to shirk the ordinary dirty work of<br>politics. Just as much as anyone else, he should be prepared to deliver<br><br>lectures in draughty halls, to chalk pavements, to canvass voters, to<br>distribute leaflets, even to fight in civil wars if it seems necessary.<br>But whatever else he does in the service of his party, he should never<br>write for it. He should make it clear that his writing is a thing apart.<br>And he should be able to act co-operatively while, if he chooses,<br>completely rejecting the official ideology. He should never turn back<br>from a train of thought because it may lead to a heresy, and he should<br>not mind very much if his unorthodoxy is smelt out, as it probably will<br>be. Perhaps it is even a bad sign in a writer if he is not suspected of<br>reactionary tendencies today, just as it was a bad sign if he was not<br>suspected of Communist sympathies twenty years ago.<br><br>But does all this mean that a writer should not only refuse to be<br>dictated to by political bosses, but also that he should refrain from<br>writing ABOUT politics? Once again, certainly not! There is no reason<br>why he should not write in the most crudely political way, if he wishes<br>to. Only he should do so as an individual, an outsider, at the most an<br>unwelcome guerrilla on the flank of a regular army. This attitude is<br>quite compatible with ordinary political usefulness. It is reasonable,<br>for example, to be willing to fight in a war because one thinks the war<br>ought to be won, and at the same time to refuse to write war propaganda.<br>Sometimes, if a writer is honest, his writings and his political<br>activities may actually contradict one another. There are occasions when<br>that is plainly undesirable: but then the remedy is not to falsify one's<br>impulses, but to remain silent.<br><br>To suggest that a creative writer, in a time of conflict, must split his<br>life into two compartments, may seem defeatist or frivolous: yet in<br>practice I do not see what else he can do. To lock yourself up in an<br>ivory tower is impossible and undesirable. To yield subjectively, not<br>merely to a party machine, but even to a group ideology, is to destroy<br>yourself as a writer. We feel this dilemma to be a painful one, because<br>we see the need of engaging in politics while also seeing what a dirty,<br>degrading business it is. And most of us still have a lingering belief<br>that every choice, even every political choice, is between good and<br>evil, and that if a thing is necessary it is also right. We should, I<br>think, get rid of this belief, which belongs to the nursery. In politics<br>one can never do more than decide which of two evils is the lesser, and<br>there are some situations from which one can only escape by acting like<br>a devil or a lunatic. War, for example, may be necessary, but it is<br>certainly not right or sane. Even a General Election is not exactly a<br>pleasant or edifying spectacle. If you have to take part in such<br>things--and I think you do have to, unless you are armoured by old age or<br>stupidity or hypocrisy--then you also have to keep part of yourself<br>inviolate. For most people the problem does not arise in the same form,<br>because their lives are split already. They are truly alive only in<br>their leisure hours, and there is no emotional connection between their<br>work and their political activities. Nor are they generally asked, in<br>the name of political loyalty, to debase themselves as workers. The<br>artist, and especially the writer, is asked just that--in fact, it is<br>the only thing that Politicians ever ask of him. If he refuses, that<br>does not mean that he is condemned to inactivity. One half of him, which<br>in a sense is the whole of him, can act as resolutely, even as violently<br>if need be, as anyone else. But his writings, in so far as they have any<br>value, will always be the product of the saner self that stands aside,<br>records the things that are done and admits their necessity, but refuses<br>to be deceived as to their true nature.<br><br></font></p>
