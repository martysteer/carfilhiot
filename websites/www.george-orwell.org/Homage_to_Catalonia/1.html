<h2>Chapter 2</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>BARBASTRO, though a long way from the front line, looked bleak and chipped.<br>Swarms of militiamen in shabby uniforms wandered up and down the streets, trying<br>to keep warm. On a ruinous wall I came upon a poster dating from the previous<br>year and announcing that 'six handsome bulls' would be killed in the arena on<br>such and such a date. How forlorn its faded colours looked! Where were the<br>handsome bulls and the handsome bull-fighters now? It appeared that even in<br>Barcelona there were hardly any bullfights nowadays; for some reason all the<br>best matadors were Fascists.<br><br>They sent my company by lorry to Sietamo, then westward to Alcubierre, which<br>was just behind the line fronting Zaragoza. Sietamo had been fought over three<br>times before the Anarchists finally took it in October, and parts of it were<br>smashed to pieces by shell-fire and most of the houses pockmarked by<br>rifle-bullets. We were 1500 feet above sea-level now. It was beastly cold, with<br>dense mists that came swirling up from nowhere. Between Sietamo and Alcubierre<br>the lorry--driver lost his way (this was one of the regular features of the war)<br>and we were wandering for hours in the mist. It was late at night when we<br>reached Alcubierre. Somebody shepherded us through morasses of mud into a<br>mule-stable where we dug ourselves down into the chaff and promptly fell asleep.<br>Chaff is not bad to sleep in when it is clean, not so good as hay but better<br>than straw. It was only in the morning light that I discovered that the chaff<br>was full of breadcrusts, torn newspapers, bones, dead rats, and jagged milk<br>tins.<br><br>We were near the front line now, near enough to smell the characteristic<br>smell of war--in my experience a smell of excrement and decaying food.<br>Alcubierre had never been shelled and was in a better state than most of the<br>villages immediately behind the line. Yet I believe that even in peacetime you<br>could not travel in that part of Spain without being struck by the peculiar<br>squalid misery of the Aragonese villages. They are built like fortresses, a mass<br>of mean little houses of mud and stone huddling round the church, and even in<br>spring you see hardly a flower anywhere; the houses have no gardens, only<br>back-yards where ragged fowls skate over the beds of mule-dung. It was vile<br>weather, with alternate mist and rain. The narrow earth roads had been churned<br>into a sea of mud, in places two feet deep, through which the lorries struggled<br>with racing wheels and the peasants led their clumsy carts which were pulled by<br>strings of mules, sometimes as many as six in a string, always pulling tandem.<br>The constant come-and-go of troops had reduced the village to a state of<br>unspeakable filth. It did not possess and never had possessed such a thing as a<br>lavatory or a drain of any kind, and there was not a square yard anywhere where<br>you could tread without watching your step. The church had long been used as a<br>latrine; so had all the fields for a quarter of a mile round. I never think of<br>my first two months at war without thinking of wintry stubble fields whose edges<br>are crusted with dung.<br><br>Two days passed and no rifles were issued to us. When you had been to the<br>Comite de Guerra and inspected the row of holes in the wall--holes made by<br>rifle-volleys, various Fascists having been executed there--you had seen all<br>the sights that Alcubierre contained. Up in the front line things were obviously<br>quiet; very few wounded were coming in. The chief excitement was the arrival of<br>Fascist deserters, who were brought under guard from the front line. Many of the<br>troops opposite us on this part of the line were not Fascists at all, merely<br>wretched conscripts who had been doing their military service at the time when<br>war broke out and were only too anxious to escape. Occasionally small batches of<br>them took the risk of slipping across to our lines. No doubt more would have<br>done so if their relatives had not been in Fascist territory. These deserters<br>were the first 'real' Fascists I had ever seen. It struck me that they were<br>indistinguishable from ourselves, except that they wore khaki overalls. They<br>were always ravenously hungry when they arrived--natural enough after a day or<br>two of dodging about in no man's land, but it was always triumphantly pointed to<br>as a proof that the Fascist troops were starving. I watched one of them being<br>fed in a peasant's house. It was somehow rather a pitiful sight. A tall boy of<br>twenty, deeply windburnt, with his clothes in rags, crouched over the fire<br>shovelling a pannikinful of stew into himself at desperate speed; and all the<br>while his eyes flitted nervously round the ring of militiamen who stood watching<br>him. I think he still half-believed that we were bloodthirsty 'Reds' and were<br>going to shoot him as soon as he had finished his meal; the armed man who<br>guarded him kept stroking his shoulder and making reassuring noises. On one<br>memorable day fifteen deserters arrived in a single batch. They were led through<br>the village in triumph with a man riding in front of them on a white horse. I<br>managed to take a rather blurry photograph which was stolen from me later.<br><br>On our third morning in Alcubierre the rifles arrived. A sergeant with a<br>coarse dark-yellow face was handing them out in the mule-stable. I got a shock<br>of dismay when I saw the thing they gave me. It was a German Mauser dated 1896--<br>more than forty years old! It was rusty, the bolt was stiff, the wooden<br>barrel-guard was split; one glance down the muzzle showed that it was corroded<br>and past praying for. Most of the rifles were equally bad, some of them even<br>worse, and no attempt was made to give the best weapons to the men who knew how<br>to use them. The best rifle of the lot, only ten years old, was given to a half--<br>witted little beast of fifteen, known to everyone as the maricoon (Nancy-boy).<br>The sergeant gave us five minutes' 'instruction', which consisted in explaining<br>how you loaded a rifle and how you took the bolt to pieces. Many of the<br>militiamen had never had a gun in their hands before, and very few, I imagine,<br>knew what the sights were for. Cartridges were handed out, fifty to a man, and<br>then the ranks were formed and we strapped our kits on our backs and set out for<br>the front line, about three miles away.<br><br>The centuria, eighty men and several dogs, wound raggedly up the road. Every<br>militia column had at least one dog attached to it as a mascot. One wretched<br>brute that marched with us had had P.O.U.M. branded on it in huge letters and<br>slunk along as though conscious that there was something wrong with its<br>appearance. At the head of the column, beside the red flag, Georges Kopp, the<br>stout Belgian commandante, was riding a black horse; a little way ahead a youth<br>from the brigand-like militia cavalry pranced to and fro, galloping up every<br>piece of rising ground and posing himself in picturesque attitudes at the<br>summit. The splendid horses of the Spanish cavalry had been captured in large<br>numbers during the revolution and handed over to the militia, who, of course,<br>were busy riding them to death.<br><br>The road wound between yellow infertile fields, untouched since last year's<br>harvest. Ahead of us was the low sierra that lies between Alcubierre and<br>Zaragoza. We were getting near the front line now, near the bombs, the<br>machine-guns, and the mud. In secret I was frightened. I knew the line was quiet<br>at present, but unlike most of the men about me I was old enough to remember the<br>Great War, though not old enough to have fought in it. War, to me, meant roaring<br>projectiles and skipping shards of steel; above all it meant mud, lice, hunger,<br>and cold. It is curious, but I dreaded the cold much more than I dreaded the<br>enemy. The thought of it had been haunting me all the time I was in Barcelona; I<br>had even lain awake at nights thinking of the cold in the trenches, the<br>stand-to's in the grisly dawns, the long hours on sentry-go with a frosted<br>rifle, the icy mud that would slop over my boot-tops. I admit, too, that I felt<br>a kind of horror as I looked at the people I was marching among. You cannot<br>possibly conceive what a rabble we looked. We straggled along with far less<br>cohesion than a flock of sheep; before we had gone two miles the rear of the<br>column was out of sight. And quite half of the so-called men were children--but<br>I mean literally children, of sixteen years old at the very most. Yet they were<br>all happy and excited at the prospect of getting to the front at last. As we<br>neared the line the boys round the red flag in front began to utter shouts of<br>'Visca P.O.U.M.!' 'Fascistas--maricones!' and so forth--shouts which were meant<br>to be war-like and menacing, but which, from those childish throats, sounded as<br>pathetic as the cries of kittens. It seemed dreadful that the defenders of the<br>Republic should be this mob of ragged children carrying worn-out rifles which<br>they did not know how to use. I remember wondering what would happen if a<br>Fascist aeroplane passed our way whether the airman would even bother to dive<br>down and give us a burst from his machine--gun. Surely even from the air he<br>could see that we were not real soldiers?<br><br>As the road struck into the sierra we branched off to the right and climbed a<br>narrow mule-track that wound round the mountain-side. The hills in that part of<br>Spain are of a queer formation, horseshoe-shaped with flattish tops and very<br>steep sides running down into immense ravines. On the higher slopes nothing<br>grows except stunted shrubs and heath, with the white bones of the limestone<br>sticking out everywhere. The front line here was not a continuous line of<br>trenches, which would have been impossible in such mountainous country; it was<br>simply a chain of fortified posts, always known as 'positions', perched on each<br>hill-top. In the distance you could see our 'position' at the crown of the<br>horseshoe; a ragged barricade of sand-bags, a red flag fluttering, the smoke of<br>dug-out fires. A little nearer, and you could smell a sickening sweetish stink<br>that lived in my nostrils for weeks afterwards. Into the cleft immediately<br>behind the position all the refuse of months had been tipped--a deep festering<br>bed of breadcrusts, excrement, and rusty tins.<br><br>The company we were relieving were getting their kits together. They had been<br>three months in the line; their uniforms were caked with mud, their boots<br>falling to pieces, their faces mostly bearded. The captain commanding the<br>position, Levinski by name, but known to everyone as Benjamin, and by birth a<br>Polish Jew, but speaking French as his native language, crawled out of his<br>dug-out and greeted us. He was a short youth of about twenty-five, with stiff<br>black hair and a pale eager face which at this period of the war was always very<br>dirty. A few stray bullets were cracking high overhead. The position was a semi--<br>circular enclosure about fifty yards across, with a parapet that was partly<br>sand-bags and partly lumps of limestone. There were thirty or forty dug-outs<br>running into the ground like rat-holes. Williams, myself, and Williams's Spanish<br>brother-in-law made a swift dive for the nearest unoccupied dug-out that looked<br>habitable. Somewhere in front an occasional rifle banged, making queer rolling<br>echoes among the stony hills. We had just dumped our kits and were crawling out<br>of the dug-out when there was another bang and one of the children of our<br>company rushed back from the parapet with his face pouring blood. He had fired<br>his rifle and had somehow managed to blow out the bolt; his scalp was torn to<br>ribbons by the splinters of the burst cartridge--case. It was our first<br>casualty, and, characteristically, self--inflicted.<br><br>In the afternoon we did our first guard and Benjamin showed us round the<br>position. In front of the parapet there ran a system of narrow trenches hewn out<br>of the rock, with extremely primitive loopholes made of piles of limestone.<br>There were twelve sentries, placed at various points in the trench and behind<br>the inner parapet. In front of the trench was the barbed wire, and then the<br>hillside slid down into a seemingly bottomless ravine; opposite were naked<br>hills, in places mere cliffs of rock, all grey and wintry, with no life<br>anywhere, not even a bird. I peered cautiously through a loophole, trying to<br>find the Fascist trench.<br><br>'Where are the enemy?'<br><br>Benjamin waved his hand expansively. 'Over zere.' (Benjamin spoke English--<br>terrible English.)<br><br>'But where?'<br><br>According to my ideas of trench warfare the Fascists would be fifty or a<br>hundred yards away. I could see nothing--seemingly their trenches were very<br>well concealed. Then with a shock of dismay I saw where Benjamin was pointing;<br>on the opposite hill-top, beyond the ravine, seven hundred metres away at the<br>very least, the tiny outline of a parapet and a red-and-yellow flag--the<br>Fascist position. I was indescribably disappointed. We were nowhere near them!<br>At that range our rifles were completely useless. But at this moment there was a<br>shout of excitement. Two Fascists, greyish figurines in the distance, were<br>scrambling up the naked hill-side opposite. Benjamin grabbed the nearest man's<br>rifle, took aim, and pulled the trigger. Click! A dud cartridge; I thought it a<br>bad omen.<br><br>The new sentries were no sooner in the trench than they began firing a<br>terrific fusillade at nothing in particular. I could see the Fascists, tiny as<br>ants, dodging to and fro behind their parapet, and sometimes a black dot which<br>was a head would pause for a moment, impudently exposed. It was obviously no use<br>firing. But presently the sentry on my left, leaving his post in the typical<br>Spanish fashion, sidled up to me and began urging me to fire. I tried to explain<br>that at that range and with these rifles you could not hit a man except by<br>accident. But he was only a child, and he kept motioning with his rifle towards<br>one of the dots, grinning as eagerly as a dog that expects a pebble to be<br>thrown. Finally I put my sights up to seven hundred and let fly. The dot<br>disappeared. I hope it went near enough to make him jump. It was the first time<br>in my life that I had fired a gun at a human being.<br><br>Now that I had seen the front I was profoundly disgusted. They called this<br>war! And we were hardly even in touch with the enemy! I made no attempt to keep<br>my head below the level of the trench. A little while later, however, a bullet<br>shot past my ear with a vicious crack and banged into the parados behind. Alas!<br>I ducked. All my life I had sworn that I would not duck the first time a bullet<br>passed over me; but the movement appears to be instinctive, and almost everybody<br>does it at least once.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/0.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/2.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
