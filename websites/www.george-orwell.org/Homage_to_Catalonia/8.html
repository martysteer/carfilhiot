<h2>Chapter 9</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>FROM Mandalay, in Upper Burma, you can travel by train to Maymyo, the<br>principal hill-station of the province, on the edge of the Shan plateau. It is<br>rather a queer experience. You start off in the typical atmosphere of an eastern<br>city--the scorching sunlight, the dusty palms, the smells of fish and spices and<br>garlic, the squashy tropical fruits, the swarming dark-faced human beings--and<br>because you are so used to it you carry this atmosphere intact, so to speak, in<br>your railway carriage. Mentally you are still in Mandalay when the train stops<br>at Maymyo, four thousand feet above sea--level. But in stepping out of the<br>carriage you step into a different hemisphere. Suddenly you are breathing cool<br>sweet air that might be that of England, and all round you are green grass,<br>bracken, fir-trees, and hill--women with pink cheeks selling baskets of<br>strawberries.<br><br>Getting back to Barcelona, after three and a half months at the front,<br>reminded me of this. There was the same abrupt and startling change of<br>atmosphere. In the train, all the way to Barcelona, the atmosphere of the front<br>persisted; the dirt, the noise, the discomfort, the ragged clothes the feeling<br>of privation, comradeship, and equality. The train, already full of militiamen<br>when it left Barbastro, was invaded by more and more peasants at every station<br>on the line; peasants with bundles of vegetables, with terrified fowls which<br>they carried head--downwards, with sacks which looped and writhed all over the<br>floor and were discovered to be full of live rabbits--finally with a quite<br>considerable flock of sheep which were driven into the compartments and wedged<br>into every empty space. The militiamen shouted revolutionary songs which drowned<br>the rattle of the train and kissed their hands or waved red and black<br>handkerchiefs to every pretty girl along the line. Bottles of wine and of anis,<br>the filthy Aragonese liqueur, travelled from hand to hand. With the Spanish<br>goat-skin water-bottles you can squirt a jet of wine right across a railway<br>carriage into your friend's mouth, which saves a lot of trouble. Next to me a<br>black-eyed boy of fifteen was recounting sensational and, I do not doubt,<br>completely untrue stories of his own exploits at the front to two old<br>leather-faced peasants who listened open-mouthed. Presently the peasants undid<br>their bundles and gave us some sticky dark-red wine. Everyone was profoundly<br>happy, more happy than I can convey. But when the train had rolled through<br>Sabadell and into Barcelona, we stepped into an atmosphere that was scarcely<br>less alien and hostile to us and our kind than if this had been Paris or<br>London.<br><br>Everyone who has made two visits, at intervals of months, to Barcelona during<br>the war has remarked upon the extraordinary changes that took place in it. And<br>curiously enough, whether they went there first in August and again in January,<br>or, like myself, first in December and again in April, the thing they said was<br>always the same: that the revolutionary atmosphere had vanished. No doubt to<br>anyone who had been there in August, when the blood was scarcely dry in the<br>streets and militia were quartered in the smart hotels, Barcelona in December<br>would have seemed bourgeois; to me, fresh from England, it was liker to a<br>workers' city than anything I had conceived possible. Now the tide had rolled<br>back. Once again it was an ordinary city, a little pinched and chipped by war,<br>but with no outward sign of working-class predominance.<br><br>The change in the aspect of the crowds was startling. The militia uniform and<br>the blue overalls had almost disappeared; everyone seemed to be wearing the<br>smart summer suits in which Spanish tailors specialize. Fat prosperous men,<br>elegant women, and sleek cars were everywhere. (It appeared that there were<br>still no private cars; nevertheless, anyone who 'was anyone' seemed able to<br>command a car.) The officers of the new Popular Army, a type that had scarcely<br>existed when I left Barcelona, swarmed in surprising numbers. The Popular Army<br>was officered at the rate of one officer to ten men. A certain number of these<br>officers had served in the militia and been brought back from the front for<br>technical instruction, but the majority were young men who had gone to the<br>School of War in preference to joining the militia. Their relation to their men<br>was not quite the same as in a bourgeois army, but there was a definite social<br>difference, expressed by the difference of pay and uniform. The men wore a kind<br>of coarse brown overalls, the officers wore an elegant khaki uniform with a<br>tight waist, like a British Army officer's uniform, only a little more so. I do<br>not suppose that more than one in twenty of them had yet been to the front, but<br>all of them had automatic pistols strapped to their belts; we, at the front,<br>could not get pistols for love or money. As we made our way up the street I<br>noticed that people were staring at our dirty exteriors. Of course, like all men<br>who have been several months in the line, we were a dreadful sight. I was<br>conscious of looking like a scarecrow. My leather jacket was in tatters, my<br>woollen cap had lost its shape and slid perpetually over one eye, my boots<br>consisted of very little beyond splayed-out uppers. All of us were in more or<br>less the same state, and in addition we were dirty and unshaven, so it was no<br>wonder that the people stared. But it dismayed me a little, and brought it home<br>to me that some queer things had been happening in the last three months.<br><br>During the next few days I discovered by innumerable signs that my first<br>impression had not been wrong. A deep change had come over the town. There were<br>two facts that were the keynote of all else. One was that the people--the civil<br>population--had lost much of their interest in the war; the other was that the<br>normal division of society into rich and poor, upper class and lower class, was<br>reasserting itself.<br><br>The general indifference to the war was surprising and rather disgusting. It<br>horrified people who came to Barcelona from Madrid or even from Valencia. Partly<br>it was due to the remoteness of Barcelona from the actual fighting; I noticed<br>the same thing a month later in Tarragona, where the ordinary life of a smart<br>seaside town was continuing almost undisturbed. But it was significant that all<br>over Spain voluntary enlistment had dwindled from about January onwards. In<br>Catalonia, in February, there had been a wave of enthusiasm over the first big<br>drive for the Popular Army, but it had not led to any great increase in<br>recruiting. The war was only six months old or thereabouts when the Spanish<br>Government had to resort to conscription, which would be natural in a foreign<br>war, but seems anomalous in a civil war. Undoubtedly it was bound up with the<br>disappointment of the revolutionary hopes with which the war had started. The<br>trade union members who formed themselves into militias and chased the Fascists<br>back to Zaragoza in the first few weeks of war had done so largely because they<br>believed themselves to be fighting for working-class control; but it was<br>becoming more and more obvious that working-class control was a lost cause, and<br>the common people, especially the town proletariat, who have to fill the ranks<br>in any war, civil or foreign, could not be blamed for a certain apathy. Nobody<br>wanted to lose the war, but the majority were chiefly anxious for it to be over.<br>You noticed this wherever you went. Everywhere you met with the same perfunctory<br>remark:' This war--terrible, isn't it? When is it going to end?' Politically<br>conscious people were far more aware of the internecine struggle between<br>Anarchist and Communist than of the fight against Franco. To the mass of the<br>people the food shortage was the most important thing. 'The front' had come to<br>be thought of as a mythical far-off place to which young men disappeared and<br>either did not return or returned after three or four months with vast sums of<br>money in their pockets. (A militiaman usually received his back pay when he went<br>on leave.) Wounded men, even when they were hopping about on crutches, did not<br>receive any special consideration. To be in the militia was no longer<br>fashionable. The shops, always the barometers of public taste, showed this<br>clearly. When I first reached Barcelona the shops, poor and shabby though they<br>were, had specialized in militiamen's equipment. Forage-caps, zipper jackets,<br>Sam Browne belts, hunting-knives, water-bottles, revolver-holsters were<br>displayed in every window. Now the shops were markedly smarter, but the war had<br>been thrust into the background. As I discovered later, when buying my kit<br>before going back to the front, certain things that one badly needed at the<br>front were very difficult to procure.<br><br>Meanwhile there was going on a systematic propaganda against the party<br>militias and in favour of the Popular Army. The position here was rather<br>curious. Since February the entire armed forces had theoretically been<br>incorporated in the Popular Army, and the militias were, on paper, reconstructed<br>along Popular Army lines, with differential pay-rates, gazetted rank, etc., etc.<br>The divisions were made up of 'mixed brigades', which were supposed to consist<br>partly of Popular Army troops and partly of militia. But the only changes that<br>had actually taken place were changes of name. The P.O.U.M. troops, for<br>instance, previously called the Lenin Division, were now known as the 29th<br>Division. Until June very few Popular Army troops reached the Aragon front, and<br>in consequence the militias were able to retain their separate structure and<br>their special character. But on every wall the Government agents had stencilled:<br>'We need a Popular Army', and over the radio and in the Communist Press there<br>was a ceaseless and sometimes very malignant jibing against the militias, who<br>were described as ill-trained, undisciplined, etc., etc.; the Popular Army was<br>always described as 'heroic'. From much of this propaganda you would have<br>derived the impression that there was something disgraceful in having gone to<br>the front voluntarily and something praiseworthy in waiting to be conscripted.<br>For the time being, however, the militias were holding the line while the<br>Popular Army was training in the rear, and this fact had to be advertised as<br>little as possible. Drafts of militia returning to the front were no longer<br>marched through the streets with drums beating and flags flying. They were<br>smuggled away by train or lorry at five o'clock in the morning. A few drafts of<br>the Popular Army were now beginning to leave for the front, and these, as<br>before, were marched ceremoniously through the streets; but even they, owing to<br>the general waning of interest in the war, met with comparatively little<br>enthusiasm. The fact that the militia troops were also, on paper. Popular Army<br>troops, was skilfully used in the Press propaganda. Any credit that happened to<br>be going was automatically handed to the Popular Army, while all blame was<br>reserved for the militias. It sometimes happened that the same troops were<br>praised in one capacity and blamed in the other.<br><br>But besides all this there was the startling change in the social atmosphere<br>--a thing difficult to conceive unless you have actually experienced it. When I<br>first reached Barcelona I had thought it a town where class distinctions and<br>great differences of wealth hardly existed. Certainly that was what it looked<br>like. 'Smart' clothes were an abnormality, nobody cringed or took tips, waiters<br>and flower-women and bootblacks looked you in the eye and called you 'comrade'.<br>I had not grasped that this was mainly a mixture of hope and camouflage. The<br>working class believed in a revolution that had been begun but never<br>consolidated, and the bourgeoisie were scared and temporarily disguising<br>themselves as workers. In the first months of revolution there must have been<br>many thousands of people who deliberately put on overalls and shouted<br>revolutionary slogans as a way of saving their skins. Now things were returning<br>to normal. The smart restaurants and hotels were full of rich people wolfing<br>expensive meals, while for the working-class population food-prices had jumped<br>enormously without any corresponding rise in wages. Apart from the expensiveness<br>of everything, there were recurrent shortages of this and that, which, of<br>course, always hit the poor rather than the rich. The restaurants and hotels<br>seemed to have little difficulty in getting whatever they wanted, but in the<br>working-class quarters the queues for bread, olive oil, and other necessaries<br>were hundreds of yards long. Previously in Barcelona I had been struck by the<br>absence of beggars; now there were quantities of them. Outside the delicatessen<br>shop at the top of the Ramblas gangs of barefooted children were always waiting<br>to swarm round anyone who came out and clamour for scraps of food. The<br>'revolutionary' forms of speech were dropping out of use. Strangers seldom<br>addressed you as tu and camarada nowadays; it was usually senor and usted.<br>Buenos dias was beginning to replace salud. The waiters were back in their<br>boiled shirts and the shop-walkers were cringing in the familiar manner. My wife<br>and I went into a hosiery shop on the Ramblas to buy some stockings. The shopman<br>bowed and rubbed his hands as they do not do even in England nowadays, though<br>they used to do it twenty or thirty years ago. In a furtive indirect way the<br>practice of tipping was coming back. The workers' patrols had been ordered to<br>dissolve and the pre-war police forces were back on the streets. One result of<br>this was that the cabaret show and high-class brothels, many of which had been<br>closed by the workers' patrols, had promptly reopened. [Note 8, below] A small but<br>significant instance of the way in which everything was now orientated in favour<br>of the wealthier classes could be seen in the tobacco shortage. For the mass of<br>the people the shortage of tobacco was so desperate that cigarettes filled with<br>sliced liquorice-root were being sold in the streets. I tried some of these<br>once. (A lot of people tried them once.) Franco held the Canaries, where all the<br>Spanish tobacco is grown; consequently the only stocks of tobacco left on the<br>Government side were those that had been in existence before the war. These were<br>running so low that the tobacconists' shops only opened once a week; after<br>waiting for a couple of hours in a queue you might, if you were lucky, get a<br>three-quarter-ounce packet of tobacco. Theoretically the Government would not<br>allow tobacco to be purchased from abroad, because this meant reducing the<br>gold-reserves, which had got to be kept for arms and other necessities. Actually<br>there was a steady supply of smuggled foreign cigarettes of the more expensive<br>kinds. Lucky Strikes and so forth, which gave a grand opportunity for<br>profiteering. You could buy the smuggled cigarettes openly in the smart hotels<br>and hardly less openly in the streets, provided that you could pay ten pesetas<br>(a militiaman's daily wage) for a packet. The smuggling was for the benefit of<br>wealthy people, and was therefore connived at. If you had enough money there was<br>nothing that you could not get in any quantity, with the possible exception of<br>bread, which was rationed fairly strictly. This open contrast of wealth and<br>poverty would have been impossible a few months earlier, when the working class<br>still were or seemed to be in control. But it would not be fair to attribute it<br>solely to the shift of political power. Partly it was a result of the safety of<br>life in Barcelona, where there was little to remind one of the war except an<br>occasional air-raid. Everyone who had been in Madrid said that it was completely<br>different there. In Madrid the common danger forced people of almost all kinds<br>into some sense of comradeship. A fat man eating quails while children are<br>begging for bread is a disgusting sight, but you are less likely to see it when<br>you are within sound of the guns.<br><br>[Note 8. The workers' patrols are said to have closed 75 per cent of the<br>brothels.]<br><br>A day or two after the street-fighting I remember passing through one of the<br>fashionable streets and coming upon a confectioner's shop with a window full of<br>pastries and bonbons of the most elegant kinds, at staggering prices. It was the<br>kind of shop you see in Bond Street or the Rue de la Paix. And I remember<br>feeling a vague horror and amazement that money could still be wasted upon such<br>things in a hungry war-stricken country. But God forbid that I should pretend to<br>any personal superiority. After several months of discomfort I had a ravenous<br>desire for decent food and wine, cocktails, American cigarettes, and so forth,<br>and I admit to having wallowed in every luxury that I had money to buy. During<br>that first week, before the street-fighting began, I had several preoccupations<br>which interacted upon one another in a curious way. In the first place, as I<br>have said, I was busy making myself as comfortable as I could. Secondly, thanks<br>to over-eating and over-drinking, I was slightly out of health all that week. I<br>would feel a little unwell, go to bed for half a day, get up and eat another<br>excessive meal, and then feel ill again. At the same time I was making secret<br>negotiations to buy a revolver. I badly wanted a revolver--in trench-fighting<br>much more useful than a rifle--and they were very difficult to get hold of. The<br>Government issued them to policemen and Popular Army officers, but refused to<br>issue them to the militia; you had to buy them, illegally, from the secret<br>stores of the Anarchists. After a lot of fuss and nuisance an Anarchist friend<br>managed to procure me a tiny 26-mm. automatic pistol, a wretched weapon, useless<br>at more than five yards but better than nothing. And besides all this I was<br>making preliminary arrangements to leave the P.O.U.M. militia and enter some<br>other unit that would ensure my being sent to the Madrid front.<br><br>I had told everyone for a long time past that I was going to leave the<br>P.O.U.M. As far as my purely personal preferences went I would have liked to<br>join the Anarchists. If one became a member of the C.N.T. it was possible to<br>enter the F.A.I. militia, but I was told that the F.A.I. were likelier to send<br>me to Teruel than to Madrid. If I wanted to go to Madrid I must join the<br>International Column, which meant getting a recommendation from a member of the<br>Communist Party. I sought out a Communist friend, attached to the Spanish<br>Medical Aid, and explained my case to him. He seemed very anxious to recruit me<br>and asked me, if possible, to persuade some of the other I.L.P. Englishmen to<br>come with me. If I had been in better health I should probably have agreed there<br>and then. It is hard to say now what difference this would have made. Quite<br>possibly I should have been sent to Albacete before the Barcelona fighting<br>started; in which case, not having seen the fighting at close quarters, I might<br>have accepted the official version of it as truthful. On the other hand, if I<br>had been in Barcelona during the fighting, under Communist orders but still with<br>a sense of personal loyalty to my comrades in the P.O.U.M., my position would<br>have been impossible. But I had another week's leave due to me and I was very<br>anxious to get my health back before returning to the line. Also--the kind of<br>detail that is always deciding one's destiny--I had to wait while the<br>boot-makers made me a new pair of marching boots. (The entire Spanish army had<br>failed to produce a pair of boots big enough to fit me.) I told my Communist<br>friend that I would make definite arrangements later. Meanwhile I wanted a rest.<br>I even had a notion that we--my wife and I--might go to the seaside for two or<br>three days. What an idea! The political atmosphere ought to have warned me that<br>that was not the kind of thing one could do nowadays.<br><br>For under the surface-aspect of the town, under the luxury and growing<br>poverty, under the seeming gaiety of the streets, with their flower--stalls,<br>their many-coloured flags, their propaganda-posters, and thronging crowds, there<br>was an unmistakable and horrible feeling of political rivalry and hatred. People<br>of all shades of opinion were saying forebodingly: 'There's going to be trouble<br>before long.' The danger was quite simple and intelligible. It was the<br>antagonism between those who wished the revolution to go forward and those who<br>wished to check or prevent it--ultimately, between Anarchists and Communists.<br>Politically there was now no power in Catalonia except the P.S.U.C. and their<br>Liberal allies. But over against this there was the uncertain strength of the<br>C.N.T., less well-armed and less sure of what they wanted than their<br>adversaries, but powerful because of their numbers and their predominance in<br>various key industries. Given this alignment of forces there was bound to be<br>trouble. From the point of view of the P.S.U.C.-controlled Generalite, the first<br>necessity, to make their position secure, was to get the weapons out of the<br>C.N.T. workers' hands. As I have pointed out earlier, the move to break up the<br>party militias was at bottom a manoeuvre towards this end. At the same time the<br>pre-war armed police forces. Civil Guards, and so forth, had been brought back<br>into use and were being heavily reinforced and armed. This could mean only one<br>thing. The Civil Guards, in particular, were a gendarmerie of the ordinary<br>continental type, who for nearly a century past had acted as the bodyguards of<br>the possessing class. Meanwhile a decree had been issued that all arms held by<br>private persons were to be surrendered. Naturally this order had not been<br>obeyed; it was clear that the Anarchists' weapons could only be taken from them<br>by force. Throughout this time there were rumours, always vague and<br>contradictory owing to newspaper censorship, of minor clashes that were<br>occurring all over Catalonia. In various places the armed police forces had made<br>attacks on Anarchist strongholds. At Puigcerda, on the French frontier, a band<br>of Carabineros were sent to seize the Customs Office, previously controlled by<br>Anarchists and Antonio Martin, a well-known Anarchist, was killed. Similar<br>incidents had occurred at Figueras and, I think, at Tarragona. In Barcelona<br>there' had been a series of more or less unofficial brawls in the working-class<br>suburbs. C.N.T. and U.G.T. members had been murdering one another for some time<br>past; on several occasions the murders were followed by huge, provocative<br>funerals which were quite deliberately intended to stir up political hatred. A<br>short time earlier a C.N.T. member had been murdered, and the C.N.T. had turned<br>out in hundreds of thousands to follow the cortege. At the end of April, just<br>after I got to Barcelona, Roldan, a prominent member of the U.G.T., was<br>murdered, presumably by someone in the C.N.T. The Government ordered all shops<br>to close and staged ah enormous funeral procession, largely of Popular Army<br>troops, which took two hours to pass a given point. From the hotel window I<br>watched it without enthusiasm. It was obvious that the so-called funeral was<br>merely a display of strength; a little more of this kind of thing and there<br>might be bloodshed. The same night my wife and I were woken by a fusillade of<br>shots from the Plaza de Cataluna, a hundred or two hundred yards away. We<br>learned next day that it was a C.N.T. man being bumped off, presumably by<br>someone in the U.G.T. It was of course distinctly possible that all these<br>murders were committed by agents provocateurs. One can gauge the attitude of the<br>foreign capitalist Press towards the Communist-Anarchist feud by the fact that<br>Roldan's murder was given wide publicity, while the answering murder was<br>carefully unmentioned.<br><br>The 1st of May was approaching, and there was talk of a monster demonstration<br>in which both the C.N.T. and the U.G.T. were to take part. The C.N.T. leaders,<br>more moderate than many of their followers, had long been working for a<br>reconciliation with the U.G.T.; indeed the keynote of their policy was to try<br>and form the two blocks of unions into one huge coalition. The idea was that the<br>C.N.T. and U.G.T. should march together and display their solidarity. But at the<br>last moment the demonstration was called off. It was perfectly clear that it<br>would only lead to rioting. So nothing happened on 1 May. It was a queer state<br>of affairs. Barcelona, the so-called revolutionary city, was probably the only<br>city in non-Fascist Europe that had no celebrations that day. But I admit I was<br>rather relieved. The I.L.P. contingent was expected to march in the P.O.U.M.<br>section of the procession, and everyone expected trouble. The last thing I<br>wished for was to be mixed up in some meaningless street-fight. To be marching<br>up the street behind red flags inscribed with elevating slogans, and then to be<br>bumped off from an upper window by some total stranger with a sub-machine-gun--<br>that is not my idea of a useful way to die.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/7.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/9.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
