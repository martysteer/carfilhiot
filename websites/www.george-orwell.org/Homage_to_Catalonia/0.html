<h2>Chapter 1</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>In the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona, the day before I joined the militia, I<br>saw an Italian militiaman standing in front of the officers' table.<br><br>He was a tough-looking youth of twenty-five or six, with reddish-yellow hair<br>and powerful shoulders. His peaked leather cap was pulled fiercely over one eye.<br>He was standing in profile to me, his chin on his breast, gazing with a puzzled<br>frown at a map which one of the officers had open on the table. Something in his<br>face deeply moved me. It was the face of a man who would commit murder and throw<br>away his life for a friend--the kind efface you would expect in an Anarchist,<br>though as likely as not he was a Communist. There were both candour and ferocity<br>in it; also the pathetic reverence that illiterate people have for their<br>supposed superiors. Obviously he could not make head or tail of the map;<br>obviously he regarded map-reading as a stupendous intellectual feat. I hardly<br>know why, but I have seldom seen anyone--any man, I mean--to whom I have taken<br>such an immediate liking. While they were talking round the table some remark<br>brought it out that I was a foreigner. The Italian raised his head and said<br>quickly:<br><br>'Italiano?'<br><br>I answered in my bad Spanish: 'No, Ingles. Y tu?'<br><br>'Italiano.'<br><br>As we went out he stepped across the room and gripped my hand very hard.<br>Queer, the affection you can feel for a stranger! It was as though his spirit<br>and mine had momentarily succeeded in bridging the gulf of language and<br>tradition and meeting in utter intimacy. I hoped he liked me as well as I liked<br>him. But I also knew that to retain my first impression of him I must not see<br>him again; and needless to say I never did see him again. One was always making<br>contacts of that kind in Spain.<br><br>I mention this Italian militiaman because he has stuck vividly in my memory.<br>With his shabby uniform and fierce pathetic face he typifies for me the special<br>atmosphere of that time. He is bound up with all my memories of that period of<br>the war--the red flags in Barcelona, the gaunt trains full of shabby soldiers<br>creeping to the front, the grey war-stricken towns farther up the line, the<br>muddy, ice-cold trenches in the mountains.<br><br>This was in late December 1936, less than seven months ago as I write, and<br>yet it is a period that has already receded into enormous distance. Later events<br>have obliterated it much more completely than they have obliterated 1935, or<br>1905, for that matter. I had come to Spain with some notion of writing newspaper<br>articles, but I had joined the militia almost immediately, because at that time<br>and in that atmosphere it seemed the only conceivable thing to do. The<br>Anarchists were still in virtual control of Catalonia and the revolution was<br>still in full swing. To anyone who had been there since the beginning it<br>probably seemed even in December or January that the revolutionary period was<br>ending; but when one came straight from England the aspect of Barcelona was<br>something startling and overwhelming. It was the first time that I had ever been<br>in a town where the working class was in the saddle. Practically every building<br>of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or with<br>the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the<br>hammer and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties; almost<br>every church had been gutted and its images burnt. Churches here and there were<br>being systematically demolished by gangs of workmen. Every shop and cafe had an<br>inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even the bootblacks had been<br>collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers<br>looked you in the face and treated you as an equal. Servile and even ceremonial<br>forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said 'Senior' or 'Don' or<br>even 'Usted'; everyone called everyone else 'Comrade' and 'Thou', and said<br>'Salud!' instead of 'Buenos dias'. Tipping was forbidden by law; almost my first<br>experience was receiving a lecture from a hotel manager for trying to tip a<br>lift-boy. There were no private motor-cars, they had all been commandeered, and<br>all the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted red and<br>black. The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming from the walls in<br>clean reds and blues that made the few remaining advertisements look like daubs<br>of mud. Down the Ramblas, the wide central artery of the town where crowds of<br>people streamed constantly to and fro, the loudspeakers were bellowing<br>revolutionary songs all day and far into the night. And it was the aspect of the<br>crowds that was the queerest thing of all. In outward appearance it was a town<br>in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist. Except for a small<br>number of women and foreigners there were no 'well-dressed' people at all.<br>Practically everyone wore rough working-class clothes, or blue overalls, or some<br>variant of the militia uniform. All this was queer and moving. There was much in<br>it that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I<br>recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for. Also I<br>believed that things were as they appeared, that this was really a workers'<br>State and that the entire bourgeoisie had either fled, been killed, or<br>voluntarily come over to the workers' side; I did not realize that great numbers<br>of well-to-do bourgeois were simply lying low and disguising themselves as<br>proletarians for the time being.<br><br>Together with all this there was something of the evil atmosphere of war. The<br>town had a gaunt untidy look, roads and buildings were in poor repair, the<br>streets at night were dimly lit for fear of air--raids, the shops were mostly<br>shabby and half-empty. Meat was scarce and milk practically unobtainable, there<br>was a shortage of coal, sugar, and petrol, and a really serious shortage of<br>bread. Even at this period the bread-queues were often hundreds of yards long.<br>Yet so far as one could judge the people were contented and hopeful. There was<br>no unemployment, and the price of living was still extremely low; you saw very<br>few conspicuously destitute people, and no beggars except the gipsies. Above<br>all, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a feeling of having<br>suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom. Human beings were trying<br>to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine. In the<br>barbers' shops were Anarchist notices (the barbers were mostly Anarchists)<br>solemnly explaining that barbers were no longer slaves. In the streets were<br>coloured posters appealing to prostitutes to stop being prostitutes. To anyone<br>from the hard-boiled, sneering civilization of the English--speaking races there<br>was something rather pathetic in the literalness with which these idealistic<br>Spaniards took the hackneyed phrases of revolution. At that time revolutionary<br>ballads of the naivest kind, all about proletarian brotherhood and the<br>wickedness of Mussolini, were being sold on the streets for a few centimes each.<br>I have often seen an illiterate militiaman buy one of these ballads, laboriously<br>spell out the words, and then, when he had got the hang of it, begin singing it<br>to an appropriate tune.<br><br>All this time I was at the Lenin Barracks, ostensibly in training for the<br>front. When I joined the militia I had been told that I should be sent to the<br>front the next day, but in fact I had to wait while a fresh centuria was got<br>ready. The workers' militias, hurriedly raised by the trade unions at the<br>beginning of the war, had not yet been organized on an ordinary army basis. The<br>units of command were the 'section', of about thirty men, the centuria, of about<br>a hundred men, and the 'column', which in practice meant any large number of<br>men. The Lenin Barracks was a block of splendid stone buildings with a riding--<br>school and enormous cobbled courtyards; it had been a cavalry barracks and had<br>been captured during the July fighting. My centuria slept in one of the stables,<br>under the stone mangers where the names of the cavalry chargers were still<br>inscribed. All the horses had been seized and sent to the front, but the whole<br>place still smelt of horse-piss and rotten oats. I was at the barracks about a<br>week. Chiefly I remember the horsy smells, the quavering bugle-calls (all our<br>buglers were amateurs--I first learned the Spanish bugle-calls by listening to<br>them outside the Fascist lines), the tramp-tramp of hobnailed boots in the<br>barrack yard, the long morning parades in the wintry sunshine, the wild games of<br>football, fifty a side, in the gravelled riding--school. There were perhaps a<br>thousand men at the barracks, and a score or so of women, apart from the<br>militiamen's wives who did the cooking. There were still women serving in the<br>militias, though not very many. In the early battles they had fought side by<br>side with the men as a matter of course. It is a thing that seems natural in<br>time of revolution. Ideas were changing already, however. The militiamen had to<br>be kept out of the riding-school while the women were drilling there because<br>they laughed at the women and put them off. A few months earlier no one would<br>have seen anything comic in a woman handling a gun.<br><br>The whole barracks was in the state of filth and chaos to which the militia<br>reduced every building they occupied and which seems to be one of the<br>by-products of revolution. In every comer you came upon piles of smashed<br>furniture, broken saddles, brass cavalry-helmets, empty sabre-scabbards, and<br>decaying food. There was frightful wastage of food, especially bread. From my<br>barrack-room alone a basketful of bread was thrown away at every meal--a<br>disgraceful thing when the civilian population was short of it. We ate at long<br>trestle-tables out of permanently greasy tin pannikins, and drank out of a<br>dreadful thing called a porron. A porron is a sort of glass bottle with a<br>pointed spout from which a thin jet of wine spurts out whenever you tip it up;<br>you can thus drink from a distance, without touching it with your lips, and it<br>can be passed from hand to hand. I went on strike and demanded a drinking-cup as<br>soon as I saw a porron in use. To my eye the things were altogether too like<br>bed-bottles, especially when they were filled with white wine.<br><br>By degrees they were issuing the recruits with uniforms, and because this was<br>Spain everything was issued piecemeal, so that it was never quite certain who<br>had received what, and various of the things we most needed, such as belts and<br>cartridge-boxes, were not issued till the last moment, when the train was<br>actually waiting to take us to the front. I have spoken of the militia<br>'uniform', which probably gives a wrong impression. It was not exactly a<br>uniform. Perhaps a 'multiform' would be the proper name for it. Everyone's<br>clothes followed the same general plan, but they were never quite the same in<br>any two cases. Practically everyone in the army wore corduroy knee-breeches, but<br>there the uniformity ended. Some wore puttees, others corduroy gaiters, others<br>leather leggings or high boots. Everyone wore a zipper jacket, but some of the<br>jackets were of leather, others of wool and of every conceivable colour. The<br>kinds of cap were about as numerous as their wearers. It was usual to adorn the<br>front of your cap with a party badge, and in addition nearly every man. wore a<br>red or red and black handkerchief round his throat. A militia column at that<br>time was an extraordinary-looking rabble. But the clothes had to be issued as<br>this or that factory rushed them out, and they were not bad clothes considering<br>the circumstances. The shirts and socks were wretched cotton things, however,<br>quite useless against cold. I hate to think of what the militiamen must have<br>gone through in the earlier months before anything was organized. I remember<br>coming upon a newspaper of only about two months earlier in which one of the<br>P.O.U.M. leaders, after a visit to the front, said that he would try to see to<br>it that 'every militiaman had a blanket'. A phrase to make you shudder if you<br>have ever slept in a trench.<br><br>On my second day at the barracks there began what was comically called<br>'instruction'. At the beginning there were frightful scenes of chaos. The<br>recruits were mostly boys of sixteen or seventeen from the back streets of<br>Barcelona, full of revolutionary ardour but completely ignorant of the meaning<br>of war. It was impossible even to get them to stand in line. Discipline did not<br>exist; if a man disliked an order he would step out of the ranks and argue<br>fiercely with the officer. The lieutenant who instructed us was a stout,<br>fresh-faced, pleasant young man who had previously been a Regular Army officer,<br>and still looked like one, with his smart carriage and spick-and-span uniform.<br>Curiously enough he was a sincere and ardent Socialist. Even more than the men<br>themselves he insisted upon complete social equality between all ranks. I<br>remember his pained surprise when an ignorant recruit addressed him as 'Senor'.<br>'What! Senor? Who is that calling me Senor? Are we not all comrades?' I doubt<br>whether it made his job any easier. Meanwhile the raw recruits were getting no<br>military training that could be of the slightest use to them. I had been told<br>that foreigners were not obliged to attend 'instruction' (the Spaniards, I<br>noticed, had a pathetic belief that all foreigners knew more of military matters<br>than themselves), but naturally I turned out with the others. I was very anxious<br>to learn how to use a machine-gun; it was a weapon I had never had a chance to<br>handle. To my dismay I found that we were taught nothing about the use of<br>weapons. The so-called instruction was simply parade-ground drill of the most<br>antiquated, stupid kind; right turn, left turn, about turn, marching at<br>attention in column of threes and all the rest of that useless nonsense which I<br>had learned when I was fifteen years old. It was an extraordinary form for the<br>training of a guerilla army to take. Obviously if you have only a few days in<br>which to train a soldier, you must teach him the things he will most need; how<br>to take cover, how to advance across open ground, how to mount guards and build<br>a parapet--above all, how to use his weapons. Yet this mob of eager children,<br>who were going to be thrown into the front line in a few days' time, were not<br>even taught how to fire a rifle or pull the pin out of a bomb. At the time I did<br>not grasp that this was because there were no weapons to be had. In the P.O.U.M.<br>militia the shortage of rifles was so desperate that fresh troops reaching the<br>front always had to take their rifles from the troops they relieved in the line.<br>In the whole of the Lenin Barracks there were, I believe, no rifles except those<br>used by the sentries.<br><br>After a few days, though still a complete rabble by any ordinary standard, we<br>were considered fit to be seen in public, and in the mornings we were marched<br>out to the public gardens on the hill beyond the Plaza de Espana. This was the<br>common drill-ground of all the party militias, besides the Carabineros and the<br>first contingents of the newly formed Popular Army. Up in the public gardens it<br>was a strange and heartening sight. Down every path and alley-way, amid the<br>formal flower-beds, squads and companies of men marched stiffly to and fro,<br>throwing out their chests and trying desperately to look like soldiers. All of<br>them were unarmed and none completely in uniform, though on most of them the<br>militia uniform was breaking out in patches here and there. The procedure was<br>always very much the same. For three hours we strutted to and fro (the Spanish<br>marching step is very short and rapid), then we halted, broke the ranks, and<br>flocked thirstily to a little grocer's shop which was half-way down the hill and<br>was doing a roaring trade in cheap wine. Everyone was very friendly to me. As an<br>Englishman I was something of a curiosity, and the Carabinero officers made much<br>of me and stood me drinks. Meanwhile, whenever I could get our lieutenant into a<br>corner, I was clamouring to be instructed in the use of a machine-gun. I used to<br>drag my Hugo's dictionary out of my pocket and start on him in my villainous<br>Spanish:<br><br>'To se manejar fusil. Mo se manejar ametralladora. Quiero apprender<br>ametralladora. Quando vamos apprender ametralladora?'<br><br>The answer was always a harassed smile and a promise that there should be<br>machine-gun instruction manana. Needless to say manana never came. Several days<br>passed and the recruits learned to march in step and spring to attention almost<br>smartly, but if they knew which end of a rifle the bullet came out of, that was<br>all they knew. One day an armed Carabinero strolled up to us when we were<br>halting and allowed us to examine his rifle. It turned out that in the whole of<br>my section no one except myself even knew how to load the rifle, much less how<br>to take aim.<br><br>All this time I was having the usual struggles with the Spanish language.<br>Apart from myself there was only one Englishman at the barracks, and nobody even<br>among the officers spoke a word of French. Things were not made easier for me by<br>the fact that when my companions spoke to one another they generally spoke in<br>Catalan. The only way I could get along was to carry everywhere a small<br>dictionary which I whipped out of my pocket in moments of crisis. But I would<br>sooner be a foreigner in Spain than in most countries. How easy it is to make<br>friends in Spain I Within a day or two there was a score of militiamen who<br>called me by my Christian name, showed me the ropes, and overwhelmed me with<br>hospitality. I am not writing a book of propaganda and I do not want to idealize<br>the P.O.U.M. militia. The whole militia--system had serious faults, and the men<br>themselves were a mixed lot, for by this time voluntary recruitment was falling<br>off and many of the best men were already at the front or dead. There was always<br>among us a certain percentage who were completely useless. Boys of fifteen were<br>being brought up for enlistment by their parents, quite openly for the sake of<br>the ten pesetas a day which was the militiaman's wage; also for the sake of the<br>bread which the militia received in plenty and could smuggle home to their<br>parents. But I defy anyone to be thrown as I was among the Spanish working class<br>--I ought perhaps to say the Catalan working class, for apart from a few<br>Aragonese and Andalusians I mixed only with Catalans--and not be struck by<br>their essential decency; above all, their straightforwardness and generosity. A<br>Spaniard's generosity, in the ordinary sense of the word, is at times almost<br>embarrassing. If you ask him for a cigarette he will force the whole packet upon<br>you. And beyond this there is generosity in a deeper sense, a real largeness of<br>spirit, which I have met with again and again in the most unpromising<br>circumstances. Some of the journalists and other foreigners who travelled in<br>Spain during the war have declared that in secret the Spaniards were bitterly<br>jealous of foreign aid. All I can say is that I never observed anything of the<br>kind. I remember that a few days before I left the barracks a group of men<br>returned on leave from the front. They were talking excitedly about their<br>experiences and were full of enthusiasm for some French troops who had been next<br>to them at Huesca. The French were very brave, they said; adding<br>enthusiastically: 'Mas valientes que nosotros'--'Braver than we are!' Of course<br>I demurred, whereupon they explained that the French knew more of the art of war<br>--were more expert with bombs, machine-guns, and so forth. Yet the remark was<br>significant. An Englishman would cut his hand off sooner than say a thing like<br>that.<br><br>Every foreigner who served in the militia spent his first few weeks in<br>learning to love the Spaniards and in being exasperated by certain of their<br>characteristics. In the front line my own exasperation sometimes reached the<br>pitch of fury. The Spaniards are good at many things, but not at making war. All<br>foreigners alike are appalled by their inefficiency, above all their maddening<br>unpunctuality. The one Spanish word that no foreigner can avoid learning is<br>manana--'tomorrow' (literally, 'the morning'). Whenever it is conceivably<br>possible, the business of today is put off until manana. This is so notorious<br>that even the Spaniards themselves make jokes about it. In Spain nothing, from a<br>meal to a battle, ever happens at the appointed time. As a general rule things<br>happen too late, but just occasionally--just so that you shan't even be able to<br>depend on their happening late--they happen too early. A train which is due to<br>leave at eight will normally leave at any time between nine and ten, but perhaps<br>once a week, thanks to some private whim of the engine-driver, it leaves at half<br>past seven. Such things can be a little trying. In theory I rather admire the<br>Spaniards for not sharing our Northern time-neurosis; but unfortunately I share<br>it myself.<br><br>After endless rumours, mananas, and delays we were suddenly ordered to the<br>front at two hours' notice, when much of our equipment was still unissued. There<br>were terrible tumults in the quartermaster's store; in the end numbers of men<br>had to leave without their full equipment. The barracks had promptly filled with<br>women who seemed to have sprung up from the ground and were helping their<br>men-folk to roll their blankets and pack their kit-bags. It was rather<br>humiliating that I had to be shown how to put on my new leather cartridge-boxes<br>by a Spanish girl, the wife of Williams, the other English militiaman. She was a<br>gentle, dark-eyed, intensely feminine creature who looked as though her life--<br>work was to rock a cradle, but who as a matter of fact had fought bravely in the<br>street-battles of July. At this time she was carrying a baby which was born just<br>ten months after the outbreak of war and had perhaps been begotten behind a<br>barricade.<br><br>The train was due to leave at eight, and it was about ten past eight when the<br>harassed, sweating officers managed to marshal us in the barrack square. I<br>remember very vividly the torchlit scene--the uproar and excitement, the red<br>flags flapping in the torchlight, the massed ranks of militiamen with their<br>knapsacks on their backs and their rolled blankets worn bandolier-wise across<br>the shoulder; and the shouting and the clatter of boots and tin pannikins, and<br>then a tremendous and finally successful hissing for silence; and then some<br>political commissar standing beneath a huge rolling red banner and making us a<br>speech in Catalan. Finally they marched us to the station, taking the longest<br>route, three or four miles, so as to show us to the whole town. In the Ramblas<br>they halted us while a borrowed band played some revolutionary tune or other.<br>Once again the conquering-hero stuff--shouting and enthusiasm, red flags and<br>red and black flags everywhere, friendly crowds thronging the pavement to have a<br>look at us, women waving from the windows. How natural it all seemed then; how<br>remote and improbable now! The train was packed so tight with men that there was<br>barely room even on the floor, let alone on the seats. At the last moment<br>Williams's wife came rushing down the platform and gave us a bottle of wine and<br>a foot of that bright red sausage which tastes of soap and gives you diarrhoea.<br>The train crawled out of Catalonia and on to the plateau of Aragon at the normal<br>wartime speed of something under twenty kilometres an hour.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/1.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
