<h2>Chapter 14</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">THE worst of being wanted by the police in a town like Barcelona is that<br>everything opens so late. When you sleep out of doors you always wake about<br>dawn, and none of the Barcelona cafes opens much before nine. It was hours<br>before I could get a cup of coffee or a shave. It seemed queer, in the barber's<br>shop, to see the Anarchist notice still on the wall, explaining that tips were<br>prohibited. 'The Revolution has struck off our chains,' the notice said. I felt<br>like telling the barbers that their chains would soon be back again if they<br>didn't look out.<br><br>I wandered back to the centre of the town. Over the P.O.U.M. buildings the<br>red flags had been torn down, Republican flags were floating in their place, and<br>knots of armed Civil Guards were lounging in the doorways. At the Red Aid centre<br>on the corner of the Plaza de Gataluna the police had amused themselves by<br>smashing most of the windows. The P.O.U.M. book-stalls had been emptied of books<br>and the notice-board farther down the Ramblas had been plastered with an<br>anti-P.O.U.M. cartoon--the one representing the mask and the Fascist face<br>beneath. Down at the bottom of the Ramblas, near the quay, I came upon a queer<br>sight; a row of militiamen, still ragged and muddy from the front, sprawling<br>exhaustedly on the chairs placed there for the bootblacks. I knew who they were<br>--indeed, I recognized one of them. They were P.O.U.M. militiamen who had come<br>down the line on the previous day to find that the P.O.U.M. had been suppressed,<br>and had had to spend the night in the streets because their homes had been<br>raided. Any P.O.U.M. militiaman who returned to Barcelona at this time had the<br>choice of going straight into hiding or into jail--not a pleasant reception<br>after three or four months in the line.<br><br>It was a queer situation that we were in. At night one was a hunted fugitive,<br>but in the daytime one could live an almost normal life. Every house known to<br>harbour P.O.U.M. supporters was--or at any rate was likely to be--under<br>observation, and it was impossible to go to a hotel or boarding-house, because<br>it had been decreed that on the arrival of a stranger the hotel-keeper must<br>inform the police immediately. Practically this meant spending the night out of<br>doors. In the daytime, on the other hand, in a town the size of Barcelona, you<br>were fairly safe. The streets were thronged by Civil Guards, Assault Guards,<br>Carabineros, and ordinary police, besides God knows how many spies in plain<br>clothes; still, they could not stop everyone who passed, and if you looked<br>normal you might escape notice. The thing to do was to avoid hanging round<br>P.O.U.M. buildings and going to cafes and restaurants where the waiters knew you<br>by sight. I spent a long time that day, and the next, in having a bath at one of<br>the public baths. This struck me as a good way of putting in the time and<br>keeping out of sight. Unfortunately the same idea occurred to a lot of people,<br>and a few days later--after I left Barcelona--the police raided one of the<br>public baths and arrested a number of 'Trotskyists' in a state of nature.<br><br>Half-way up the Ramblas I ran into one of the wounded men from the Sanatorium<br>Maurin. We exchanged the sort of invisible wink that people were exchanging at<br>that time, and managed in an unobtrusive way to meet in a cafe farther up the<br>street. He had escaped arrest when the Maurin was raided, but, like the others,<br>had been driven into the street. He was in shirt-sleeves--had had to flee<br>without his jacket--and had no money. He described to me how one of the Civil<br>Guards had torn the large coloured portrait of Maurin from the wall and kicked<br>it to pieces. Maurin (one of the founders of the P.O.U.M.) was a prisoner in the<br>hands of the Fascists and at that time was believed to have been shot by<br>them.<br><br>I met my wife at the British Consulate at ten o'clock. McNair and Cottman<br>turned up shortly afterwards. The first thing they told me was that Bob Smillie<br>was dead. He had died in prison at Valencia--of what, nobody knew for certain.<br>He had been buried immediately, and the I.L.P. representative on the spot, David<br>Murray, had been refused permission to see his body.<br><br>Of course I assumed at once that Smillie had been shot. It was what everyone<br>believed at the time, but I have since thought that I may have been wrong. Later<br>the cause of his death was given out as appendicitis, and we heard afterwards<br>from another prisoner who had been released that Smillie had certainly been ill<br>in prison. So perhaps the appendicitis story was true. The refusal to let Murray<br>see his body may have been due to pure spite. I must say this, however. Bob<br>Smillie was only twenty-two years old and physically he was one of the toughest<br>people I have met. He was, I think, the only person I knew, English or Spanish,<br>who went three months in the trenches without a day's illness. People so tough<br>as that do not usually die of appendicitis if they are properly looked after.<br>But when you saw what the Spanish jails were like--the makeshift jails used for<br>political prisoners--you realized how much chance there was of a sick man<br>getting proper attention. The jails were places that could only be described as<br>dungeons. In England you would have to go back to the eighteenth century to find<br>anything comparable. People were penned together in small rooms where there was<br>barely space for them to lie down, and often they were kept in cellars and other<br>dark places. This was not as a temporary measure--there were cases of people<br>being kept four and five months almost without sight of daylight. And they were<br>fed on a filthy and insufficient diet of two plates of soup and two pieces of<br>bread a day. (Some months later, however, the food seems to have improved a<br>little.) I am not exaggerating; ask any political suspect who was imprisoned in<br>Spain. I have had accounts of the Spanish jails from a number of separate<br>sources, and they agree with one another too well to be disbelieved; besides, I<br>had a few glimpses into one Spanish jail myself. Another English friend who was<br>imprisoned later writes that his experiences in jail 'make Smillie's case easier<br>to understand'. Smillie's death is not a thing I can easily forgive. Here was<br>this brave and gifted boy, who had thrown up his career at Glasgow University in<br>order to come and fight against Fascism, and who, as I saw for myself, had done<br>his job at the front with faultless courage and willingness; and all they could<br>find to do with him was to fling him into jail and let him die like a neglected<br>animal. I know that in the middle of a huge and bloody war it is no use making<br>too much fuss over an individual death. One aeroplane bomb in a crowded street<br>causes more suffering than quite a lot of political persecution. But what angers<br>one about a death like this is its utter pointlessness. To be killed in battle--<br>yes, that is what one expects; but to be flung into jail, not even for any<br>imaginary offence, but simply owing to dull blind spite, and then left to die in<br>solitude--that is a different matter. I fail to see how this kind of thing--<br>and it is not as though Smillie's case were exceptional--brought victory any<br>nearer.<br><br>My wife and I visited Kopp that afternoon. You were allowed to visit<br>prisoners who were not incommunicado, though it was not safe to do so more than<br>once or twice. The police watched the people who came and went, and if you<br>visited the jails too often you stamped yourself as a friend of 'Trotskyists'<br>and probably ended in jail yourself. This had already happened to a number of<br>people.<br><br>Kopp was not incommunicado and we got a permit to see him without difficulty.<br>As they led us through the steel doors into the jail, a Spanish militiaman whom<br>I had known at the front was being led out between two Civil Guards. His eye met<br>mine; again the ghostly wink. And the first person we saw inside was an American<br>militiaman who had left for home a few days earlier; his papers were in good<br>order, but they had arrested him at the frontier all the same, probably because<br>he was still wearing corduroy breeches and was therefore identifiable as a<br>militiaman. We walked past one another as though we had been total strangers.<br>That was dreadful. I had known him. for months, had shared a dug-out with him,<br>he had helped to carry me down the line when I was wounded; but it was the only<br>thing one could do. The blue--clad guards were snooping everywhere. It would be<br>fatal to recognize too many people.<br><br>The so-called jail was really the ground floor of a shop. Into two rooms each<br>measuring about twenty feet square, close on a hundred people were penned. The<br>place had the real eighteenth-century Newgate Calendar appearance, with its<br>frowsy dirt, its huddle of human bodies, its lack of furniture--just the bare<br>stone floor, one bench, and a few ragged blankets--and its murky light, for the<br>corrugated steel shutters had been drawn over the windows. On the grimy walls<br>revolutionary slogans--'Visca P.O.U.M.!' 'Viva la Revolucion!' and so forth--<br>had been scrawled. The place had been used as a dump for political prisoners for<br>months past. There was a deafening racket of voices. This was the visiting hour,<br>and the place was so packed with people that it was difficult to move. Nearly<br>all of them were of the poorest of the working-class population. You saw women<br>undoing pitiful packets of food which they had brought for their imprisoned<br>men-folk. There were several of the wounded men from the Sanatorium Maurin among<br>the prisoners. Two of them had amputated legs; one of them had been brought to<br>prison without his crutch and was hopping about on one foot. There was also a<br>boy of not more than twelve; they were even arresting children, apparently. The<br>place had the beastly stench that you always get when crowds of people are<br>penned together without proper sanitary arrangements.<br><br>Kopp elbowed his way through the crowd to meet us. His plump fresh--coloured<br>face looked much as usual, and in that filthy place he had kept his uniform neat<br>and had even contrived to shave. There was another officer in the uniform of the<br>Popular Army among the prisoners. He and Kopp saluted as they struggled past one<br>another; the gesture was pathetic, somehow. Kopp seemed in excellent spirits.<br>'Well, I suppose we shall all be shot,' he said cheerfully. The word 'shot' gave<br>me a sort of inward shudder. A bullet had entered my own body recently and the<br>feeling of it was fresh in my memory; it is not nice to think of that happening<br>to anyone you know well. At that time I took it for granted that all the<br>principal people in the P.O.U.M., and Kopp among them, would be shot. The first<br>rumour of Nin's death had just filtered through, and we knew that the P.O.U.M.<br>were being accused of treachery and espionage. Everything pointed to a huge<br>frame-up trial followed by a massacre of leading 'Trotskyists.' It is a terrible<br>thing to see your friend in jail and to know yourself impotent to help him. For<br>there was nothing that one could do; useless even to appeal to the Belgian<br>authorities, for Kopp had broken the law of his own country by coming here. I<br>had to leave most of the talking to my wife; with my squeaking voice I could not<br>make myself heard in the din. Kopp was telling us about the friends he had made<br>among the other prisoners, about the guards, some of whom were good fellows, but<br>some of whom abused and beat the more timid prisoners, and about the food, which<br>was 'pig-wash'. Fortunately we had thought to bring a packet of food, also<br>cigarettes. Then Kopp began telling us about the papers that had been taken from<br>him when he was arrested. Among them was his letter from the Ministry of War,<br>addressed to the colonel commanding engineering operations in the Army of the<br>East. The police had seized it and refused to give it back; it was said to be<br>lying in the Chief of Police's office. It might make a very great difference if<br>it were recovered.<br><br>I saw instantly how important this might be. An official letter of that kind,<br>bearing the recommendation of the Ministry of War and of General Pozas, would<br>establish Kopp's bona fides. But the trouble was to prove that the letter<br>existed; if it were opened in the Chief of Police's office one could be sure<br>that some nark or other would destroy it. There was only one person who might<br>possibly be able to get it back, and that was the officer to whom it was<br>addressed. Kopp had already thought of this, and he had written a letter which<br>he wanted me to smuggle out of the jail and post. But it was obviously quicker<br>and surer to go in person. I left my wife with Kopp, rushed out, and, after a<br>long search, found a taxi. I knew that time was everything. It was now about<br>half past five, the colonel would probably leave his office at six, and by<br>tomorrow the letter might be God knew where--destroyed, perhaps, or lost<br>somewhere in the chaos of documents that was presumably piling up as suspect<br>after suspect was arrested. The colonel's office was at the War Department down<br>by the quay. As I hurried up the steps the Assault Guard on duty at the door<br>barred the way with his long bayonet and demanded 'papers'. I waved my discharge<br>ticket at him; evidently he could not read, and he let me pass, impressed by the<br>vague mystery of' papers'. Inside, the place was a huge complicated warren<br>running round a central courtyard, with hundreds of offices on each floor; and,<br>as this was Spain, nobody had the vaguest idea where the office I was looking<br>for was. I kept repeating: 'El coronet--, jefe de ingenieros, Ejercito de Este!'<br>People smiled and shrugged their shoulders gracefully. Everyone who had an<br>opinion sent me in a different direction; up these stairs, down those, along<br>interminable passages which turned out to be blind alleys. And time was slipping<br>away. I had the strangest sensation of being in a nightmare: the rushing up and<br>down flights of stairs, the mysterious people coming and going, the glimpses<br>through open doors of chaotic offices with papers strewn everywhere and<br>typewriters clicking; and time slipping away and a life perhaps in the<br>balance.<br><br>However, I got there in time, and slightly to my surprise I was granted a<br>hearing. I did not see Colonel--, but his aide-de-camp or secretary, a little<br>slip of an officer in smart uniform, with large and squinting eyes, came out to<br>interview me in the ante-room. I began to pour forth my story. I had come on<br>behalf of my superior officer. Major Jorge Kopp, who was on an urgent mission to<br>the front and had been arrested by mistake. The letter to Colonel--was of a<br>confidential nature and should be recovered without delay. I had served with<br>Kopp for months, he was an officer of the highest character, obviously his<br>arrest was a mistake, the police had confused him with someone else, etc., etc.,<br>etc. I kept piling it on about the urgency of Kopp's mission to the front,<br>knowing that this was the strongest point. But it must have sounded a strange<br>tale, in my villainous Spanish which elapsed into French at every crisis. The<br>worst was that my voice gave out almost at once and it was only by violent<br>straining that I could produce a sort of croak. I was in dread that it would<br>disappear altogether and the little officer would grow tired of trying to listen<br>to me. I have often wondered what he thought was wrong with my Voice--whether<br>he thought I was drunk or merely suffering from a guilty conscience.<br><br>However, he heard me patiently, nodded his head a great number of times, and<br>gave a guarded assent to what I said. Yes, it sounded as though there might have<br>been a mistake. Clearly the matter should be looked into. Manana--I protested.<br>Not manana! The matter was urgent; Kopp was due at the front already. Again the<br>officer seemed to agree. Then came the question I was dreading:<br><br>'This Major Kopp--what force was he serving in?'<br><br>The terrible word had to come out: 'In the P.O.U.M. militia.'<br><br>'P.O.U.M.!'<br><br>I wish I could convey to you the shocked alarm in his voice. You have got to<br>remember how the P.O.U.M. was regarded at that moment. The spy--scare was at its<br>height; probably all good Republicans did believe for a day or two that the<br>P.O.U.M. was a huge spying organization in German pay. To have to say such a<br>thing to an officer in the Popular Army was like going into the Cavalry Club<br>immediately after the Red Letter scare and announcing yourself a Communist. His<br>dark eyes moved obliquely across my face. Another long pause, then he said<br>slowly:<br><br>'And you say you were with him at the front. Then you were serving in the<br>P.O.U.M. militia yourself?'<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>He turned and dived into the colonel's room. I could hear an agitated<br>conversation. 'It's all up,' I thought. We should never get Kopp's letter back.<br>Moreover I had had to confess that I was in the P.O.U.M. myself, and no doubt<br>they would ring up the police and get me arrested, just to add another<br>Trotskyist to the bag. Presently, however, the officer reappeared, fitting on<br>his cap, and sternly signed to me to follow. We were going to the Chief of<br>Police's office. It was a long way, twenty minutes' walk. The little officer<br>marched stiffly in front with a military step. We did not exchange a single word<br>the whole way. When we got to the Chief of Police's office a crowd of the most<br>dreadful-looking scoundrels, obviously police narks, informers, and spies of<br>every kind, were hanging about outside the door. The little officer went in;<br>there was a long, heated conversation. You could hear voices furiously raised;<br>you pictured violent gestures, shrugging of the shoulders, hangings on the<br>table. Evidently the police were refusing to give the letter up. At last,<br>however, the officer emerged, flushed, but carrying a large official envelope.<br>It was Kopp's letter. We had won a tiny victory--which, as it turned out, made<br>not the slightest difference. The letter was duly delivered, but Kopp's military<br>superiors were quite unable to get him out of jail.<br><br>The officer promised me that the letter should be delivered. But what about<br>Kopp? I said. Could we not get him released? He shrugged his shoulders. That was<br>another matter. They did not know what Kopp had been arrested for. He would only<br>tell me that the proper inquiries would be made. There was no more to be said;<br>it was time to part. Both of us bowed slightly. And then there happened a<br>strange and moving thing. The little officer hesitated a moment, then stepped<br>across, and shook hands with me.<br><br>I do not know if I can bring home to you how deeply that action touched me.<br>It sounds a small thing, but it was not. You have got to realize what was the<br>feeling of the time--the horrible atmosphere of suspicion and hatred, the lies<br>and rumours circulating everywhere, the posters screaming from the hoardings<br>that I and everyone like me was a Fascist spy. And you have got to remember that<br>we were standing outside the Chief of Police's office, in front of that filthy<br>gang of tale-bearers and agents provocateurs, any one of whom might know that I<br>was 'wanted' by the police. It was like publicly shaking hands with a German<br>during the Great War. I suppose he had decided in some way that I was not really<br>a Fascist spy; still, it was good of him to shake hands.<br><br>I record this, trivial though it may sound, because it is somehow typical of<br>Spain--of the flashes of magnanimity that you get from Spaniards in the worst<br>of circumstances. I have the most evil memories of Spain, but I have very few<br>bad memories of Spaniards. I only twice remember even being seriously angry with<br>a Spaniard, and on each occasion, when I look back, I believe I was in the wrong<br>myself. They have, there is no doubt, a generosity, a species of nobility, that<br>do not really belong to the twentieth century. It is this that makes one hope<br>that in Spain even Fascism may take a comparatively loose and bearable form. Few<br>Spaniards possess the damnable efficiency and consistency that a modern<br>totalitarian state needs. There had been a queer little illustration of this<br>fact a few nights earlier, when the police had searched my wife's room. As a<br>matter of fact that search was a very interesting business, and I wish I had<br>seen it, though perhaps it is as well that I did not, for I might not have kept<br>my temper.<br><br>The police conducted the search in the recognized Ogpu or Gestapo style. In<br>the small hours of the morning there was a pounding on the door, and six men<br>marched in, switched on the light, and immediately took up various positions<br>about the room, obviously agreed upon beforehand. They then searched both rooms<br>(there was a bathroom attached) with inconceivable thoroughness. They sounded<br>the walls, took up the mats, examined the floor, felt the curtains, probed under<br>the bath and the radiator, emptied every drawer and suitcase and felt every<br>garment and held it up to the light. They impounded all papers, including the<br>contents of the waste-paper basket, and all our books into the bargain. They<br>were thrown into ecstasies of suspicion by finding that we possessed a French<br>translation of Hitler's Mein Kampf. If that had been the only book they found<br>our doom would have been sealed. It is obvious that a person who reads Mein<br>Kampf must be a Fascist. The next moment, however, they came upon a copy of<br>Stalin's pamphlet. Ways of Liquidating Trotskyists and other Double Dealers,<br>which reassured them somewhat. In one drawer there was a number of packets of<br>cigarette papers. They picked each packet to pieces and examined each paper<br>separately, in case there should be messages written on them. Altogether they<br>were on the job for nearly two hours. Yet all this time they never searched the<br>bed. My wife was lying in bed all the while; obviously there might have been<br>half a dozen sub--machine-guns under the mattress, not to mention a library<br>of Trotskyist documents under the pillow. Yet the detectives made no move to<br>touch the bed, never even looked underneath it. I cannot believe that this is a<br>regular feature of the Ogpu routine. One must remember that the police were<br>almost entirely under Communist control, and these men were probably Communist<br>Party members themselves. But they were also Spaniards, and to turn a woman out<br>of bed was a little too much for them. This part of the job was silently<br>dropped, making the whole search meaningless.<br><br>That night McNair, Cottman, and I slept in some long grass at the edge of a<br>derelict building-lot. It was a cold night for the time of year and no one slept<br>much. I remember the long dismal hours of loitering about before one could get a<br>cup of coffee. For the first time since I had been in Barcelona I went to have a<br>look at the cathedral--a modern cathedral, and one of the most hideous<br>buildings in the world. It has four crenellated spires exactly the shape of hock<br>bottles. Unlike most of the churches in Barcelona it was not damaged during the<br>revolution--it was spared because of its 'artistic value', people said. I think<br>the Anarchists showed bad taste in not blowing it up when they had the chance,<br>though they did hang a red and black banner between its spires. That afternoon<br>my wife and I went to see Kopp for the last time. There was nothing that we<br>could do for him, absolutely nothing, except to say good-bye and leave money<br>with Spanish friends who would take him food and cigarettes. A little while<br>later, however, after we had left Barcelona, he was placed incommunicado and not<br>even food could be sent to him. That night, walking down the Ramblas, we passed<br>the Cafe Moka, which the Civil Guards were still holding in force. On an impulse<br>I went in and spoke to two of them who were leaning against the counter with<br>their rifles slung over their shoulders. I asked them if they knew which of<br>their comrades had been on duty here at the time of the May fighting. They did<br>not know, and, with the usual Spanish vagueness, did not know how one could find<br>out. I said that my friend Jorge Kopp was in prison and would perhaps be put on<br>trial for something in connexion with the May fighting; that the men who were on<br>duty here would know that he had stopped the fighting and saved some of their<br>lives; they ought to come forward and give evidence to that effect. One of the<br>men I was talking to was a dull, heavy-looking man who kept shaking his head<br>because he could not hear my voice in the din of the traffic. But the other was<br>different. He said he had heard of Kopp's action from some of his comrades; Kopp<br>was buen chico (a good fellow). But even at the time I knew that it was all<br>useless. If Kopp were ever tried, it would be, as in all such trials, with faked<br>evidence. If he has been shot (and I am afraid it is quite likely), that will be<br>his epitaph: the buen chico of the poor Civil Guard who was part of a dirty<br>system but had remained enough of a human being to know a decent action when he<br>saw one.<br><br>It was an extraordinary, insane existence that we were leading. By night we<br>were criminals, but by day we were prosperous English visitors--that was our<br>pose, anyway. Even after a night in the open, a shave, a bath, and a shoe-shine<br>do wonders with your appearance. The safest thing at present was to look as<br>bourgeois as possible. We frequented the fashionable residential quarter of the<br>town, where our faces were not known, went to expensive restaurants, and were<br>very English with the waiters. For the first time in my life I took to writing<br>things on walls. The passage-ways of several smart restaurants had 'Visca<br>P.O.U.M.!' scrawled on them as large as I could write it. All the while, though<br>I was technically in hiding, I could not feel myself in danger. The whole thing<br>seemed too absurd. I had the ineradicable English belief that' they' cannot<br>arrest you unless you have broken the law. It is a most dangerous belief to have<br>during a political pogrom. There was a warrant out for McNair's arrest, and the<br>chances were that the rest of us were on the list as well. The arrests, raids,<br>searchings were continuing without pause; practically everyone we knew, except<br>those who were still at the front, was in jail by this time. The police were<br>even boarding the French ships that periodically took off refugees and seizing<br>suspected 'Trotskyists'.<br><br>Thanks to the kindness of the British consul, who must have had a very trying<br>time during that week, we had managed to get our passports into order. The<br>sooner we left the better. There was a train that was due to leave for Port Bou<br>at half past seven in the evening and might normally be expected to leave at<br>about half past eight. We arranged that my wife should order a taxi beforehand<br>and then pack her bags, pay her bill, and leave the hotel at the last possible<br>moment. If she gave the hotel people too much notice they would be sure to send<br>for the police. I got down to the station at about seven to find that the train<br>had already gone--it had left at ten to seven. The engine--driver had changed<br>his mind, as usual. Fortunately we managed to warn my wife in time. There was<br>another train early the following morning. McNair, Cottman, and I had dinner at<br>a little restaurant near the station and by cautious questioning discovered that<br>the restaurant--keeper was a C.N.T. member and friendly. He let us a<br>three-bedded room and forgot to warn the police. It was the first time in five<br>nights that I had been able to sleep with my clothes off.<br><br>Next morning my wife slipped out of the hotel successfully. The train was<br>about an hour late in starting. I filled in the time by writing a long letter to<br>the Ministry of War, telling them about Kopp's case--that without a doubt he<br>had been arrested by mistake, that he was urgently needed at the front, that<br>countless people would testify that he was innocent of any offence, etc., etc.,<br>etc. I wonder if anyone read that letter, written on pages torn out of a<br>note-book in wobbly handwriting (my fingers were still partly paralysed) and<br>still more wobbly Spanish. At any rate, neither this letter nor anything else<br>took effect. As I write, six months after the event, Kopp (if he has not been<br>shot) is still in jail, untried and uncharged. At the beginning we had two or<br>three letters from him, smuggled out by released prisoners and posted in France.<br>They all told the same story--imprisonment in filthy dark dens, bad and<br>insufficient food, serious illness due to the conditions of imprisonment, and<br>refusal of medical attention. I have had all this confirmed from several other<br>sources, English and French. More recently he disappeared into one of the<br>'secret prisons' with which it seems impossible to make any kind of<br>communication. His case is the case of scores or hundreds of foreigners and no<br>one knows how many thousands of Spaniards.<br><br>In the end we crossed the frontier without incident. The train had a first<br>class and a dining-car, the first I had seen in Spain. Until recently there had<br>been only one class on the trains in Catalonia. Two detectives came round the<br>train taking the names of foreigners, but when they saw us in the dining-car<br>they seemed satisfied that we were respectable. It was queer how everything had<br>changed. Only six months ago, when the Anarchists still reigned, it was looking<br>like a proletarian that made you respectable. On the way down from Perpignan to<br>Cerberes a French commercial traveller in my carriage had said to me in all<br>solemnity: 'You mustn't go into Spain looking like that. Take off that collar<br>and tie. They'll tear them off you in Barcelona.' He was exaggerating, but it<br>showed how Catalonia was regarded. And at the frontier the Anarchist guards had<br>turned back a smartly dressed Frenchman and his wife, solely--I think--because<br>they looked too bourgeois. Now it was the other way about; to look bourgeois was<br>the one salvation. At the passport office they looked us up in the card--index<br>of suspects, but thanks to the inefficiency of the police our names were not<br>listed, not even McNair's. We were searched from head to foot, but we possessed<br>nothing incriminating, except my discharge--papers, and the carabineros who<br>searched me did not know that the 29th Division was the P.O.U.M. So we slipped<br>through the barrier, and after just six months I was on French soil again. My<br>only souvenirs of Spain were a goatskin water-bottle and one of those tiny iron<br>lamps in which the Aragon peasants bum olive oil--lamps almost exactly the<br>shape of the terra-cotta lamps that the Romans used two thousand years ago--<br>which I had picked up in some ruined hut, and which had somehow got stuck in my<br>luggage.<br><br>After all, it turned out that we had come away none too soon. The very first<br>newspaper we saw announced McNair's arrest for espionage. The Spanish<br>authorities had been a little premature in announcing this. Fortunately,<br>'Trotskyism'is not extraditable.<br><br>I wonder what is the appropriate first action when you come from a country at<br>war and set foot on peaceful soil. Mine was to rush to the tobacco-kiosk and buy<br>as many cigars and cigarettes as I could stuff into my pockets. Then we all<br>went to the buffet and had a cup of tea, the first tea with fresh milk in it<br>that we had had for many months. It was several days before I could get used to<br>the idea that you could buy cigarettes whenever you wanted them. I always<br>half-expected to see the tobacconists' doors barred and the forbidding notice<br>'No hay tabaco' in the window.<br><br>McNair and Cottman were going on to Paris. My wife and I got off the train at<br>Banyuls, the first station up the line, feeling that we would like a rest. We<br>were not too well received in Banyuls when they discovered that we had come from<br>Barcelona. Quite a number of times I was involved in the same conversation: 'You<br>come from Spain? Which side were you fighting on? The Government? Oh!'--and<br>then a marked coolness. The little town seemed solidly pro-Franco, no doubt<br>because of the various Spanish Fascist refugees who had arrived there from time<br>to time. The waiter at the cafe I frequented was a pro-Franco Spaniard and used<br>to give me lowering glances as he served me with an aperitif. It was otherwise<br>in Perpignan, which was stiff with Government partisans and where all the<br>different factions were caballing against one another almost as in Barcelona.<br>There was one cafe where the word 'P.O.U.M.' immediately procured you French<br>friends and smiles from the waiter.<br><br>I think we stayed three days in Banyuls. It was a strangely restless time. In<br>this quiet fishing-town, remote from bombs, machine-guns, food-queues,<br>propaganda, and intrigue, we ought to have felt profoundly relieved and<br>thankful. We felt nothing of the kind. The things we had seen in Spain did not<br>recede and fall into proportion now that we were away from them; instead they<br>rushed back upon us and were far more vivid than before. We thought, talked,<br>dreamed incessantly of Spain. For months past we had been telling ourselves that<br>'when we get out of Spain' we would go somewhere beside the Mediterranean and be<br>quiet for a little while and perhaps do a little fishing, but now that we were<br>here it was merely a bore and a disappointment. It was chilly weather, a<br>persistent wind blew off the sea, the water was dull and choppy, round the<br>harbour's edge a scum of ashes, corks, and fish-guts bobbed against the stones.<br>It sounds like lunacy, but the thing that both of us wanted was to be back in<br>Spain. Though it could have done no good to anybody, might indeed have done<br>serious harm, both of us wished that we had stayed to be imprisoned along with<br>the others. I suppose I have failed to convey more than a little of what those<br>months in Spain meant to me. I have recorded some of the outward events, but I<br>cannot record the feeling they have left me with. It is all mixed up with<br>sights, smells, and sounds that cannot be conveyed in writing: the smell of the<br>trenches, the mountain dawns stretching away into inconceivable distances, the<br>frosty crackle of bullets, the roar and glare of bombs; the clear cold light of<br>the Barcelona mornings, and the stamp of boots in the barrack yard, back in<br>December when people still believed in the revolution; and the food-queues and<br>the red and black flags and the faces of Spanish militiamen; above all the faces<br>of militiamen--men whom I knew in the line and who are now scattered Lord knows<br>where, some killed in battle, some maimed, some in prison--most of them, I<br>hope, still safe and sound. Good luck to them all; I hope they win their war and<br>drive all the foreigners out of Spain, Germans, Russians, and Italians alike.<br>This war, in which I played so ineffectual a part, has left me with memories<br>that are mostly evil, and yet I do not wish that I had missed it. When you have<br>had a glimpse of such a disaster as this--and however it ends the Spanish war<br>will turn out to have been an appalling disaster, quite apart from the slaughter<br>and physical suffering--the result is not necessarily disillusionment and<br>cynicism. Curiously enough the whole experience has left me with not less but<br>more belief in the decency of human beings. And I hope the account I have given<br>is not too misleading. I believe that on such an issue as this no one is or can<br>be completely truthful. It is difficult to be certain about anything except what<br>you have seen with your own eyes, and consciously or unconsciously everyone<br>writes as a partisan. In case I have not said this somewhere earlier in the book<br>I will say it now: beware of my partisanship, my mistakes of fact, and the<br>distortion inevitably caused by my having seen only one corner of events. And<br>beware of exactly the same things when you read any other book on this period of<br>the Spanish war.<br><br>Because of the feeling that we ought to be doing something, though actually<br>there was nothing we could do, we left Banyuls earlier than we had intended.<br>With every mile that you went northward France grew greener and softer. Away<br>from the mountain and the vine, back to the meadow and the elm. When I had<br>passed through Paris on my way to Spain it had seemed to me decayed and gloomy,<br>very different from the Paris I had known eight years earlier, when living was<br>cheap and Hitler was not heard of. Half the cafes I used to know were shut for<br>lack of custom, and everyone was obsessed with the high cost of living and the<br>fear of war. Now, after poor Spain, even Paris seemed gay and prosperous. And<br>the Exhibition was in full swing, though we managed to avoid visiting it.<br><br>And then England--southern England, probably the sleekest landscape in the<br>world. It is difficult when you pass that way, especially when you are<br>peacefully recovering from sea-sickness with the plush cushions of a boat-train<br>carriage under your bum, to believe that anything is really happening anywhere.<br>Earthquakes in Japan, famines in China, revolutions in Mexico? Don't worry, the<br>milk will be on the doorstep tomorrow morning, the New Statesman will come out<br>on Friday. The industrial towns were far away, a smudge of smoke and misery<br>hidden by the curve of the earth's surface. Down here it was still the England I<br>had known in my childhood: the railway-cuttings smothered in wild flowers, the<br>deep meadows where the great shining horses browse and meditate, the slow-moving<br>streams bordered by willows, the green bosoms of the elms, the larkspurs in the<br>cottage gardens; and then the huge peaceful wilderness of outer London, the<br>barges on the miry river, the familiar streets, the posters telling of cricket<br>matches and Royal weddings, the men in bowler hats, the pigeons in Trafalgar<br>Square, the red buses, the blue policemen--all sleeping the deep, deep sleep of<br>England, from which I sometimes fear that we shall never wake till we are jerked<br>out of it by the roar of bombs.<br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/12.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center></font></p>
