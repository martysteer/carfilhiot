<h2>Chapter 10</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>ABOUT midday on 3 May a friend crossing the lounge of the hotel said<br>casually: 'There's been some kind of trouble at the Telephone Exchange, I hear.'<br>For some reason I paid no attention to it at the time.<br><br>That afternoon, between three and four, I was half-way down the Ramblas when<br>I heard several rifle-shots behind me. I turned round and saw some youths, with<br>rifles in their hands and the red and black handkerchiefs of the Anarchists<br>round their throats, edging up a side--street that ran off the Ramblas<br>northward. They were evidently exchanging shots with someone in a tall octagonal<br>tower--a church, I think--that commanded the side-street. I thought instantly:<br>'It's started!' But I thought it without any very great feeling of surprise--<br>for days past everyone had been expecting 'it' to start at any moment. I<br>realized that I must get back to the hotel at once and see if my wife was all<br>right. But the knot of Anarchists round the opening of the side-street were<br>motioning the people back and shouting to them not to cross the line of fire.<br>More shots rang out. The bullets from the tower were flying across the street<br>and a crowd of panic-stricken people was rushing down the Ramblas, away from the<br>firing; up and down the street you could hear snap--snap--snap as the<br>shopkeepers slammed the steel shutters over their windows. I saw two Popular<br>Army officers retreating cautiously from tree to tree with their hands on their<br>revolvers. In front of me the crowd was surging into the Metro station in the<br>middle of the Ramblas to take cover. I immediately decided not to follow them.<br>It might mean being trapped underground for hours.<br><br>At this moment an American doctor who had been with us at the front ran up to<br>me and grabbed me by the arm. He was greatly excited.<br><br>'Come on, we must get down to the Hotel Falcon.' (The Hotel Falcon was a sort<br>of boarding-house maintained by the P.O.U.M. and used chiefly by militiamen on<br>leave.) 'The P.O.U.M. chaps will be meeting there. The trouble's starting. We<br>must hang together.'<br><br>'But what the devil is it all about?' I said.<br><br>The doctor was hauling me along by the arm. He was too excited to give a very<br>clear statement. It appeared that he had been in the Plaza de Cataluna when<br>several lorry-loads of armed Civil Guards had driven up to the Telephone<br>Exchange, which was operated mainly by C.N.T. workers, and made a sudden assault<br>upon it. Then some Anarchists had arrived and there had been a general affray. I<br>gathered that the 'trouble' earlier in the day had been a demand by the<br>Government to hand over the Telephone Exchange, which, of course, was<br>refused.<br><br>As we moved down the street a lorry raced past us from the opposite<br>direction. It was full of Anarchists with rifles in their hands. In front a<br>ragged youth was lying on a pile of mattresses behind a light machine-gun. When<br>we got to the Hotel Falcon, which was at the bottom of the Ramblas, a crowd of<br>people was seething in the entrance-hall; there was a great confusion, nobody<br>seemed to know what we were expected to do, and nobody was armed except the<br>handful of Shock Troopers who usually acted as guards for the building. I went<br>across to the Comite Local of the P.O.U.M., which was almost opposite. Upstairs,<br>in the room where militiamen normally went to draw their pay, another crowd was<br>seething. A tall, pale, rather handsome man of about thirty, in civilian<br>clothes, was trying to restore order and handing out belts and cartridge-boxes<br>from a pile in the corner. There seemed to be no rifles as yet. The doctor had<br>disappeared--I believe there had already been casualties and a call for doctors<br>--but another Englishman had arrived. Presently, from an inner office, the tall<br>man and some others began bringing out armfuls of rifles and handing them round.<br>The other Englishman and myself, as foreigners, were slightly under suspicion<br>and at first nobody would give us a rifle. Then a militiaman whom I had known at<br>the front arrived and recognized me, after which we were given rifles and a. few<br>clips of cartridges, somewhat grudgingly.<br><br>There was a sound of firing in the distance and the streets were completely<br>empty of people. Everyone said that it was impossible to go up the Ramblas. The<br>Civil Guards had seized buildings in commanding positions and were letting fly<br>at everyone who passed. I would have risked it and gone back to the hotel, but<br>there was a vague idea floating round that the Comite Local was likely to be<br>attacked at any moment and we had better stand by. All over the building, on the<br>stairs, and on the pavement outside, small knots of people were standing and<br>talking excitedly. No one seemed to have a very clear idea of what was<br>happening. All I could gather was that the Civil Guards had attacked the<br>Telephone Exchange and seized various strategic spots that commanded other<br>buildings belonging to the workers. There was a general impression that the<br>Civil Guards were 'after' the C.N.T. and the working class generally. It was<br>noticeable that, at this stage, no one seemed to put the blame on the<br>Government. The poorer classes in Barcelona looked upon the Civil Guards as<br>something rather resembling the Black and Tans, and it seemed to be taken for<br>granted that they had started this attack on their own initiative. Once I heard<br>how things stood I felt easier in my mind. The issue was clear enough. On one<br>side the C.N.T., on the other side the police. I have no particular love for the<br>idealized 'worker' as he appears in the bourgeois Communist's mind, but when I<br>see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the<br>policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.<br><br>A long time passed and nothing seemed to be happening at our end of the town.<br>It did not occur to me that I could ring up the hotel and find out whether my<br>wife was all right; I took it for granted that the Telephone Exchange would have<br>stopped working--though, as a matter of fact, it was only out of action for a<br>couple of hours. There seemed to be about three hundred people in the two<br>buildings. Predominantly they were people of the poorest class, from the<br>back-streets down by the quays; there was a number of women among them, some of<br>them carrying babies, and a crowd of little ragged boys. I fancy that many of<br>them had no notion what was happening and had simply fled into the P.O.U.M.<br>buildings for protection. There was also a number of militiamen on leave, and a<br>sprinkling of foreigners. As far as I could estimate, there were only about<br>sixty rifles between the lot of us. The office upstairs was ceaselessly besieged<br>by a crowd of people who were demanding rifles and being told that there were<br>none left. The younger militia boys, who seemed to regard the whole affair as a<br>kind of picnic, were prowling round and trying to wheedle or steal rifles from<br>anyone who had them. It was not long before one of them got my rifle away from<br>me by a clever dodge and immediately made himself scarce. So I was unarmed<br>again, except for my tiny automatic pistol, for which I had only one clip of<br>cartridges.<br><br>It grew dark, I was getting hungry, and seemingly there was no food in the<br>Falcon. My friend and I slipped out to his hotel, which was not far away, to get<br>some dinner. The streets were utterly dark and silent, not a soul stirring,<br>steel shutters drawn over all the shop windows, but no barricades built yet.<br>There was a great fuss before they would let us into the hotel, which was locked<br>and barred. When we got back I learned that the Telephone Exchange was working<br>and went to the telephone in the office upstairs to ring up my wife.<br>Characteristically, there was no telephone directory in the building, and I did<br>not know the number of the Hotel Continental; after a searching from room to<br>room for about an hour I came upon a guide-book which gave me the number. I<br>could not make contact with my wife, but I managed to get hold of John McNair,<br>the I.L.P. representative in Barcelona. He told me that all was well, nobody had<br>been shot, and asked me if we were all right at the Comite Local. I said that we<br>should be all right if we had some cigarettes. I only meant this as a joke;<br>nevertheless half an hour later McNair appeared with two packets of Lucky<br>Strike. He had braved the pitch-dark streets, roamed by Anarchist patrols who<br>had twice stopped him at the pistol's point and examined his papers. I shall not<br>forget this small act of heroism. We were very glad of the cigarettes.<br><br>They had placed armed guards at most of the windows, and in the street below<br>a little group of Shock Troopers were stopping and questioning the few<br>passers-by. An Anarchist patrol car drove up, bristling with weapons. Beside the<br>driver a beautiful dark-haired girl of about eighteen was nursing a<br>sub-machine-gun across her knees. I spent a long time wandering about the<br>building, a great rambling place of which it was impossible to learn the<br>geography. Everywhere was the usual litter, the broken furniture and torn paper<br>that seem to be the inevitable products of revolution. All over the place people<br>were sleeping; on a broken sofa in a passage two poor women from the quayside<br>were peacefully snoring. The place had been a cabaret-theatre before the<br>P.O.U.M. took it over. There were raised stages in several of the rooms; on one<br>of them was a desolate grand piano. Finally I discovered what I was looking for<br>--the armoury. I did not know how this affair was going to turn out, and I badly<br>wanted a weapon. I had heard it said so often that all the rival parties,<br>P.S.U.C., P.O.U.M., and C.N.T.-F.A.I. alike, were hoarding arms in Barcelona,<br>that I could not believe that two of the principal P.O.U.M. buildings contained<br>only the fifty or sixty rifles that I had seen. The room which acted as an<br>armoury was unguarded and had a flimsy door; another Englishman and myself had<br>no difficulty in prizing it open. When we got inside we found that what they had<br>told us was true--there were no more weapons. All we found there were about two<br>dozen small-bore rifles of an obsolete pattern and a few shot--guns, with no<br>cartridges for any of them. I went up to the office and asked if they had any<br>spare pistol ammunition; they had none. There were a few boxes of bombs,<br>however, which one of the Anarchist patrol cars had brought us. I put a couple<br>in one of my cartridge-boxes. They were a crude type of bomb, ignited by rubbing<br>a sort of match at the top and very liable to go off of their own accord.<br><br>People were sprawling asleep all over the floor. In one room a baby was<br>crying, crying ceaselessly. Though this was May the night was getting cold. On<br>one of the cabaret-stages the curtains were still up, so I ripped a curtain down<br>with my knife, rolled myself up in it, and had a few hours' sleep. My sleep was<br>disturbed, I remember, by the thought of those beastly bombs, which might blow<br>me into the air if I rolled on them too vigorously. At three in the morning the<br>tall handsome man who seemed to be in command woke me up, gave me a rifle, and<br>put me on guard at one of the windows. He told me that Salas, the Chief of<br>Police responsible for the attack on the Telephone Exchange, had been placed<br>under arrest. (Actually, as we learned later, he had only been deprived of his<br>post. Nevertheless the news confirmed the general impression that the Civil<br>Guards had acted without orders.) As soon as it was dawn the people downstairs<br>began building two barricades, one outside the Comite Local and the other<br>outside the Hotel Falcon. The Barcelona streets are paved with square cobbles,<br>easily built up into a wall, and under the cobbles is a kind of shingle that is<br>good for filling sand-bags. The building of those barricades was a strange and<br>wonderful sight; I would have given something to be able to photograph it. With<br>the kind--of passionate energy that Spaniards display when they have definitely<br>decided to begin upon any job of work, long lines of men, women, and quite small<br>children were tearing up the cobblestones, hauling them along in a hand-cart<br>that had been found somewhere, and staggering to and fro under heavy sacks of<br>sand. In the doorway of the Comite Local a German-Jewish girl, in a pair of<br>militiaman's trousers whose knee--buttons just reached her ankles, was watching<br>with a smile. In a couple of hours the barricades were head-high, with riflemen<br>posted at the loopholes, and behind one barricade a fire was burning and men<br>were frying eggs.<br><br>They had taken my rifle away again, and there seemed to be nothing that one<br>could usefully do. Another Englishman and myself decided to go back to the Hotel<br>Continental. There was a lot of firing in the distance, but seemingly none in<br>the Ramblas. On the way up we looked in at the food-market. A very few stalls<br>had opened; they were besieged by a crowd of people from the working-class<br>quarters south of the Ramblas. Just as we got there, there was a heavy crash of<br>rifle--fire outside, some panes of glass in the roof were shivered, and the<br>crowd went flying for the back exits. A few stalls remained open, however; we<br>managed to get a cup of coffee each and buy a wedge of goat's-milk cheese which<br>I tucked in beside my bombs. A few days later I was very glad of that<br>cheese.<br><br>At the street-corner where I had seen the Anarchists begin. firing the day<br>before a barricade was now standing. The man behind it (I was on the other side<br>of the street) shouted to me to be careful. The Civil Guards in the church tower<br>were firing indiscriminately at everyone who passed. I paused and then crossed<br>the opening at a run; sure enough, a bullet cracked past me, uncomfortably<br>close. When I neared the P.O.U.M. Executive Building, still on the other side of<br>the road, there were fresh shouts of warning from some Shock Troopers standing<br>in the doorway--shouts which, at the moment, I did not understand. There were<br>trees and a newspaper kiosk between myself and the building (streets of this<br>type in Spain have a broad walk running down the middle), and I could not see<br>what they were pointing at. I went up to the Continental, made sure that all was<br>well, washed my face, and then went back to the P.O.U.M. Executive Building (it<br>was about a hundred yards down the street) to ask for orders. By this time the<br>roar of rifle and machine-gun fire from various directions was almost comparable<br>to the din of a battle. I had just found Kopp and was asking him what we were<br>supposed to do when there was a series of appalling crashes down below. The din<br>was so loud that I made sure someone must be firing at us with a field-gun.<br>Actually it was only hand-grenades, which make double their usual noise when<br>they burst among stone buildings.<br><br>Kopp glanced out of the window, cocked his stick behind his back, said: 'Let<br>us investigate,' and strolled down the stairs in his usual unconcerned manner, I<br>following. Just inside the doorway a group of Shock Troopers were bowling bombs<br>down the pavement as though playing skittles. The bombs were bursting twenty<br>yards away with a frightful, ear-splitting crash which was mixed up with the<br>banging of rifles. Half across the street, from behind the newspaper kiosk, a<br>head--it was the head of an American militiaman whom I knew well--was sticking<br>up, for all the world like a coconut at a fair. It was only afterwards that I<br>grasped what was really happening. Next door to the P.O.U.M. building there was<br>a cafe with a hotel above it, called the Cafe Moka. The day before twenty or<br>thirty armed Civil Guards had entered the cafe and then, when the fighting<br>started, had suddenly seized the building and barricaded themselves in.<br>Presumably they had been ordered to seize the cafe as a preliminary to attacking<br>the P.O.U.M. offices later. Early in the morning they had attempted to come out,<br>shots had been exchanged, and one Shock Trooper was badly wounded and a Civil<br>Guard killed. The Civil Guards had fled back into the cafe, but when the<br>American came down the street they had opened fire on him, though he was not<br>armed. The American had flung himself behind the kiosk for cover, and the Shock<br>Troopers were flinging bombs at the Civil Guards to drive them indoors<br>again.<br><br>Kopp took in the scene at a glance, pushed his way forward and hauled back a<br>red-haired German Shock Trooper who was just drawing the pin out of a bomb with<br>his teeth. He shouted to everyone to stand back from the doorway, and told us in<br>several languages that we had got to avoid bloodshed. Then he stepped out on to<br>the pavement and, in sight of the Civil Guards, ostentatiously took off his<br>pistol and laid it on the ground. Two Spanish militia officers did the same, and<br>the three of them walked slowly up to the doorway where the Civil Guards were<br>huddling. It was a thing I would not have done for twenty pounds. They were<br>walking, unarmed, up to men who were frightened out of their wits and had loaded<br>guns in their hands. A Civil Guard, in shirt-sleeves and livid with fright, came<br>out of the door to parley with Kopp. He kept pointing in an agitated manner at<br>two unexploded bombs that were lying on the pavement. Kopp came back and told us<br>we had better touch the bombs off. Lying there, they were a danger to anyone who<br>passed. A Shock Trooper fired his rifle at one of the bombs and burst it, then<br>fired at the other and missed. I asked him to give me his rifle, knelt down and<br>let fly at the second bomb. I also missed it, I am sorry to say.<br><br>This was the only shot I fired during the disturbances. The pavement was<br>covered with broken glass from the sign over the Cafe Moka, and two cars that<br>were parked outside, one of them Kopp's official car, had been riddled with<br>bullets and their windscreens smashed by bursting bombs.<br><br>Kopp took me upstairs again and explained the situation. We had got to defend<br>the P.O.U.M. buildings if they were attacked, but the P.O.U.M. leaders had sent<br>instructions that we were to stand on the defensive and not open fire if we<br>could possibly avoid it. Immediately opposite there was a cinematograph, called<br>the Poliorama, with a museum above it, and at the top, high above the general<br>level of the roofs, a small observatory with twin domes. The domes commanded the<br>street, and a few men posted up there with rifles could prevent any attack on<br>the P.O.U.M. buildings. The caretakers at the cinema were C.N.T. members and<br>would let us come and go. As for the Civil Guards in the Cafe Moka, there would<br>be no trouble with them; they did not want to fight and would be only too glad<br>to live and let live. Kopp repeated that our orders were not to fire unless we<br>were fired on ourselves or our buildings attacked. I gathered, though he did not<br>say so, that the P.O.U.M. leaders were furious at being dragged into this<br>affair, but felt that they had got to stand by the C.N.T.<br><br>They had already placed guards in the observatory. The next three days and<br>nights I spent continuously on the roof of the Poliorama, except for brief<br>intervals when I slipped across to the hotel for meals. I was in no danger, I<br>suffered from nothing worse than hunger and boredom, yet it was one of the most<br>unbearable periods of my whole life. I think few experiences could be more<br>sickening, more disillusioning, or, finally, more nerve-racking than those evil<br>days of street warfare.<br><br>I used to sit on the roof marvelling at the folly of it all. From the little<br>windows in the observatory you could see for miles around--vista after vista of<br>tall slender buildings, glass domes, and fantastic curly roofs with brilliant<br>green and copper tiles; over to eastward the glittering pale blue sea--the<br>first glimpse of the sea that I had had since coming to Spain. And the whole<br>huge town of a million people was locked in a sort of violent inertia, a<br>nightmare of noise without movement. The sunlit streets were quite empty.<br>Nothing was happening except the streaming of bullets from barricades and<br>sand-bagged windows. Not a vehicle was stirring in the streets; here and there<br>along the Ramblas the trams stood motionless where their drivers had jumped out<br>of them when the fighting started. And all the while the devilish noise, echoing<br>from thousands of stone buildings, went on and on and on, like a tropical<br>rainstorm. Crack-crack, rattle--rattle, roar--sometimes it died away to a few<br>shots, sometimes it quickened to a deafening fusillade, but it never stopped<br>while daylight lasted, and punctually next dawn it started again.<br><br>What the devil was happening, who was fighting whom, and who was winning, was<br>at first very difficult to discover. The people of Barcelona are so used to<br>street-fighting and so familiar with the local geography that they knew by a<br>kind of instinct which political party will hold which streets and which<br>buildings. A foreigner is at a hopeless disadvantage. Looking out from the<br>observatory, I could grasp that the Ramblas, which is one of the principal<br>streets of the town, formed a dividing line. To the right of the Ramblas the<br>working-class quarters were solidly Anarchist; to the left a confused fight was<br>going on among the tortuous by-streets, but on that side the P.S.U.C. and the<br>Civil Guards were more or less in control. Up at our end of the Ramblas, round<br>the Plaza de Cataluna, the position was so complicated that it would have been<br>quite unintelligible if every building had not flown a party flag. The principal<br>landmark here was the Hotel Colon, the headquarters of the P.S.U.C., dominating<br>the Plaza de Cataluna. In a window near the last 0 but one in the huge 'Hotel<br>Colon' that sprawled across its face they had a machine-gun that could sweep the<br>square with deadly effect. A hundred yards to the right of us, down the Ramblas,<br>the J.S.U., the youth league of the P.S.U.C. (corresponding to the Young<br>Communist League in England), were holding a big department store whose<br>sandbagged side-windows fronted our observatory. They had hauled down their red<br>flag and hoisted the Catalan national flag. On the Telephone Exchange, the<br>starting-point of all the trouble, the Catalan national flag and the Anarchist<br>flag were flying side by side. Some kind of temporary compromise had been<br>arrived at there, the exchange was working uninterruptedly and there was no<br>firing from the building.<br><br>In our position it was strangely peaceful. The Civil Guards in the Cafe Moka<br>had drawn down the steel curtains and piled up the cafe furniture to make a<br>barricade. Later half a dozen of them came on to the roof, opposite to<br>ourselves, and built another barricade of mattresses, over which they hung a<br>Catalan national flag. But it was obvious that they had no wish to start a<br>fight. Kopp had made a definite agreement with them: if they did not fire at us<br>we would not fire at them. He had grown quite friendly with the Civil Guards by<br>this time, and had been to visit them several times in the Cafe Moka. Naturally<br>they had looted everything drinkable the cafe possessed, and they made Kopp a<br>present of fifteen bottles of beer. In return Kopp had actually given them one<br>of our rifles to make up for one they had somehow lost on the previous day.<br>Nevertheless, it was a queer feeling sitting on that roof. Sometimes I was<br>merely bored with the whole affair, paid no attention to the hellish noise, and<br>spent hours reading a succession of Penguin Library books which, luckily, I had<br>bought a few days earlier; sometimes I was very conscious of the armed men<br>watching me fifty yards away. It was a little like being in the trenches again;<br>several times I caught myself, from force of habit, speaking of the Civil Guards<br>as 'the Fascists'. There were generally about six of us up there. We placed a<br>man on guard in each of the observatory towers, and the rest of us sat on the<br>lead roof below, where there was no cover except a stone palisade. I was well<br>aware that at any moment the Civil Guards might receive telephone orders to open<br>fire. They had agreed to give us warning before doing so, but there was no<br>certainty that they would keep to their agreement. Only once, however, did<br>trouble look like starting. One of the Civil Guards opposite knelt down and<br>began firing across the barricade. I was on guard in the observatory at the<br>time. I trained my rifle on him and shouted across:<br><br>'Hi! Don't you shoot at us!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Don't you fire at us or we'll fire back!'<br><br>'No, no! I wasn't firing at you. Look--down there!'<br><br>He motioned with his rifle towards the side-street that ran past the bottom<br>of our building. Sure enough, a youth in blue overalls, with a rifle in his<br>hand, was dodging round the corner. Evidently he had just taken a shot at the<br>Civil Guards on the roof.<br><br>'I was firing at him. He fired first.' (I believe this was true.) 'We don't<br>want to shoot you. We're only workers, the same as you are.'<br><br>He made the anti-Fascist salute, which I returned. I shouted across:<br><br>'Have you got any more beer left?'<br><br>'No, it's all gone.'<br><br>The same day, for no apparent reason, a man in the J.S.U. building farther<br>down the street suddenly raised his rifle and let fly at me when I was leaning<br>out of the window. Perhaps I made a tempting mark. I did not fire back. Though<br>he was only a hundred yards away the bullet went so wide that it did not even<br>hit the roof of the observatory. As usual, Spanish standards of marksmanship had<br>saved me. I was fired at several times from this building.<br><br>The devilish racket of firing went on and on. But so far as I could see, and<br>from all I heard, the fighting was defensive on both sides. People simply<br>remained in their buildings or behind their barricades and blazed away at the<br>people opposite. About half a mile away from us there was a street where some of<br>the main offices of the C.N.T. and the U.G.T. were almost exactly facing one<br>another; from that direction the volume of noise was terrific. I passed down<br>that street the day after the fighting was over and the panes of the<br>shop-windows were like sieves. (Most of the shopkeepers in Barcelona had their<br>windows criss-crossed with strips of paper, so that when a bullet hit a pane it<br>did not shiver to pieces.) Sometimes the rattle of rifle and machine-gun fire<br>was punctuated by the crash of hand-grenades. And at long intervals, perhaps a<br>dozen times in all, there were tremendously heavy explosions which at the time I<br>could not account for; they sounded like aerial bombs, but that was impossible,<br>for there were no aeroplanes about. I was told afterwards--quite possibly it<br>was true--that agents provocateurs were touching off masses of explosive in<br>order to increase the general noise and panic. There was, however, no<br>artillery-fire. I was listening for this, for if the guns began to fire it would<br>mean that the affair was becoming serious (artillery is the determining factor<br>in street warfare). Afterwards there were wild tales in the newspapers about<br>batteries of guns firing in the streets, but no one was able to point to a<br>building that had been hit by a shell. In any case the sound of gunfire is<br>unmistakable if one is used to it.<br><br>Almost from the start food was running short. With difficulty and under cover<br>of darkness (for the Civil Guards were constantly sniping into the Ramblas) food<br>was brought from the Hotel Falcon for the fifteen or twenty militiamen who were<br>in the P.O.U.M. Executive Building, but there was barely enough to go round, and<br>as many of us as possible went to the Hotel Continental for our meals. The<br>Continental had been 'collectivized' by the Generalite and not, like most of the<br>hotels, by the C.N.T. or U.G.T., and it was regarded as neutral ground. No<br>sooner had the fighting started than the hotel filled to the brim with a most<br>extraordinary collection of people. There were foreign journalists, political<br>suspects of every shade, an American airman in the service of the Government,<br>various Communist agents, including a fat, sinister-looking Russian, said to be<br>an agent of the Ogpu, who was nicknamed Charlie Chan and wore attached to his<br>waist-band a revolver and a neat little bomb, some families of well--to-do<br>Spaniards who looked like Fascist sympathizers, two or three wounded men from<br>the International Column, a gang of lorry drivers from. some huge French lorries<br>which had been carrying a load of oranges back to France and had been held up by<br>the fighting, and a number of Popular Army officers. The Popular Army, as a<br>body, remained neutral throughout the fighting, though a few soldiers slipped<br>away from the barracks and took part as individuals; on the Tuesday morning I<br>had seen a couple of them at the P.O.U.M. barricades. At the beginning, before<br>the food-shortage became acute and the newspapers began stirring up hatred,<br>there was a tendency to regard the whole affair as a joke. This was the kind of<br>thing that happened every year in Barcelona, people were saying. George Tioli,<br>an Italian journalist, a great friend of ours, came in with his trousers<br>drenched with blood. He had gone out to see what was happening and had been<br>binding up a wounded man on the pavement when someone playfully tossed a<br>hand-grenade at him, fortunately not wounding him seriously. I remember his<br>remarking that the Barcelona paving-stones ought to be numbered; it would save<br>such a lot of trouble in building and demolishing barricades. And I remember a<br>couple of men from the International Column sitting in my room at the hotel when<br>I came in tired, hungry, and dirty after a night on guard. Their attitude was<br>completely neutral. If they had been good party-men they would, I suppose, have<br>urged me to change sides, or even have pinioned me and taken away the bombs of<br>which my pockets were full; instead they merely commiserated with me for having<br>to spend my leave in doing guard-duty on a roof. The general attitude was: 'This<br>is only a dust-up between the Anarchists and the police--it doesn't mean<br>anything.' In spite of the extent of the fighting and the number of casualties I<br>believe this was nearer the truth than the official version which represented<br>the affair as a planned rising.<br><br>It was about Wednesday (5 May) that a change seemed to come over things. The<br>shuttered streets looked ghastly. A very few pedestrians, forced abroad for one<br>reason or another, crept to and fro, flourishing white handkerchiefs, and at a<br>spot in the middle of the Ramblas that was safe from bullets some men were<br>crying newspapers to the empty street. On Tuesday Solidaridad Obrera, the<br>Anarchist paper, had described the attack on the Telephone Exchange as a<br>'monstrous provocation' (or words to that effect), but on Wednesday it changed<br>its tune and began imploring everyone to go back to work. The Anarchist leaders<br>were broadcasting the same message. The office of La Batalla, the P.O.U.M.<br>paper, which was not defended, had been raided and seized by the Civil Guards at<br>about the same time as the Telephone Exchange, but the paper was being printed,<br>and a few copies distributed, from another address. I urged everyone to remain<br>at the barricades. People were divided in their minds and wondering uneasily how<br>the devil this was going to end. I doubt whether anyone left the barricades as<br>yet, but everyone was sick of the meaningless fighting, which could obviously<br>lead to no real decision, because no one wanted this to develop into a<br>full-sized civil war which might mean losing the war against Franco. I heard<br>this fear expressed on all sides. So far as one could gather from what people<br>were saying at the time the C.N.T. rank and file wanted, and had wanted from the<br>beginning, only two things: the handing back of the Telephone Exchange and the<br>disarming of the hated Civil Guards. If the Generalite had promised to do these<br>two things, and also promised to put an end to the food profiteering, there is<br>little doubt that the barricades would have been down in two hours. But it was<br>obvious that the Generalite was not going to give in. Ugly rumours were flying<br>round. It was said that the Valencia Government was sending six thousand men to<br>occupy Barcelona, and that five thousand Anarchist and P.O.U.M. troops had left<br>the Aragon front to oppose them. Only the first of these rumours was true.<br>Watching from the observatory tower we saw the low grey shapes of warships<br>closing in upon the harbour. Douglas Moyle, who had been a sailor, said that<br>they looked like British destroyers. As a matter of fact they were British<br>destroyers, though we did not learn this till afterwards.<br><br>That evening we heard that on the Plaza de Espana four hundred Civil Guards<br>had surrendered and handed their arms to the Anarchists; also the news was<br>vaguely filtering through that in the suburbs (mainly working-class quarters)<br>the C.N.T. were in control. It looked as though we were winning. But the same<br>evening Kopp sent for me and, with a grave face, told me that according to<br>information he had just received the Government was about to outlaw the P.O.U.M.<br>and declare a state of war upon it. The news gave me a shock. It was the first<br>glimpse I had had of the interpretation that was likely to be put upon this<br>affair later on. I dimly foresaw that when the fighting ended the entire blame<br>would be laid upon the P.O.U.M., which was the weakest party and therefore the<br>most suitable scapegoat. And meanwhile our local neutrality was at an end. If<br>the Government declared war upon us we had no choice but to defend ourselves,<br>and here at the Executive building we could be certain that the Civil Guards<br>next door would get orders to attack us. Our only chance was to attack them<br>first. Kopp was waiting for orders on the telephone; if we heard definitely that<br>the P.O.U.M. was outlawed we must make preparations at once to seize the Cafe<br>Moka.<br><br>I remember the long, nightmarish evening that we spent in fortifying the<br>building. We locked the steel curtains across the front entrance and behind them<br>built a barricade of slabs of stone left behind by the workmen who had been<br>making some alterations. We went over our stock of weapons. Counting the six<br>rifles that were on the roof of the Poliorama opposite, we had twenty-one<br>rifles, one of them defective, about fifty rounds of ammunition for each rifle,<br>and a few dozen bombs; otherwise nothing except a few pistols and revolvers.<br>About a dozen men, mostly Germans, had volunteered for the attack on the Cafe<br>Moka, if it came off. We should attack from the roof, of course, some time in<br>the small hours, and take them by surprise; they were more numerous, but our<br>morale was better, and no doubt we could storm the place, though people were<br>bound to be killed in doing so. We had no food in the building except a few<br>slabs of chocolate, and the rumour had gone round that 'they' were going to cut<br>off the water supply. (Nobody knew who 'they' were. It might be the Government<br>that controlled the waterworks, or it might be the C.N.T.--nobody knew.) We<br>spent a long time filling up every basin in the lavatories, every bucket we<br>could lay hands on, and, finally, the fifteen beer bottles, now empty, which the<br>Civil Guards had given to Kopp.<br><br>I was in a ghastly frame of mind and dog-tired after about sixty hours<br>without much sleep. It was now late into the night. People were sleeping all<br>over the floor behind the barricade downstairs. Upstairs there was a small room,<br>with a sofa in it, which we intended to use as a dressing-station, though,<br>needless to say, we discovered that there was neither iodine nor bandages in the<br>building. My wife had come down from the hotel in case a nurse should be needed.<br>I lay down on the sofa, feeling that I would like half an hour's rest before the<br>attack on the Moka, in which I should presumably be killed. I remember the<br>intolerable discomfort caused by my pistol, which was strapped to my belt and<br>sticking into the small of my back. And the next thing I remember is waking up<br>with a jerk to find my wife standing beside me. It was broad daylight, nothing<br>had happened, the Government had not declared war on the P.O.U.M., the water had<br>not been cut off, and except for the sporadic firing in the streets everything<br>was normal. My wife said that she had not had the heart to wake me and had slept<br>in an arm-chair in one of the front rooms.<br><br>That afternoon there was a kind of armistice. The firing died away and with<br>surprising suddenness the streets filled with people. A few shops began to pull<br>up their shutters, and the market was packed with a huge crowd clamouring for<br>food, though the stalls were almost empty. It was noticeable, however, that the<br>trams did not start running. The Civil Guards were still behind their barricades<br>in the Moka; on neither side were the fortified buildings evacuated. Everyone<br>was rushing round and trying to buy food. And on every side you heard the same<br>anxious questions: 'Do you think it's stopped? Do you think it's going to start<br>again?' 'It'--the fighting--was now thought of as some kind of natural<br>calamity, like a hurricane or an earthquake, which was happening to us all alike<br>and which we had no power of stopping. And sure enough, almost immediately--I<br>suppose there must really have been several hours' truce, but they seemed more<br>like minutes than hours--a sudden crash of rifle-fire, like a June cloud-burst,<br>sent everyone scurrying; the steel shutters snapped into place, the streets<br>emptied like magic, the barricades were manned, and 'it' had started again.<br><br>I went back to my post on the roof with a feeling of concentrated disgust and<br>fury. When you are taking part in events like these you are, I suppose, in a<br>small way, making history, and you ought by rights to feel like a historical<br>character. But you never do, because at such times the physical details always<br>outweigh everything else. Throughout the fighting I never made the correct<br>'analysis' of the situation that was so glibly made by journalists hundreds of<br>miles away. What I was chiefly thinking about was not the rights and wrongs of<br>this miserable internecine scrap, but simply the discomfort and boredom of<br>sitting day and night on that intolerable roof, and the hunger which was growing<br>worse and worse--for none of us had had a proper meal since Monday. It was in<br>my mind all the while that I should have to go back to the front as soon as this<br>business was over. It was infuriating. I had been a hundred and fifteen days in<br>the line and had come back to Barcelona ravenous for a bit of rest and comfort;<br>and instead I had to spend my time sitting on a roof opposite Civil Guards as<br>bored as myself, who periodically waved to me and assured me that they were<br>'workers' (meaning that they hoped I would not shoot them), but who would<br>certainly open fire if they got the order to do so. If this was history it did<br>not feel like it. It was more like a bad period at the front, when men were<br>short and we had to do abnormal hours of guard-duty; instead of being heroic one<br>just had to stay at one's post, bored, dropping with sleep, and completely<br>uninterested as to what it was all about.<br><br>Inside the hotel, among the heterogeneous mob who for the most part had not<br>dared to put their noses out of doors, a horrible atmosphere of suspicion had<br>grown up. Various people were infected with spy mania and were creeping round<br>whispering that everyone else was a spy of the Communists, or the Trotskyists,<br>or the Anarchists, or what-not. The fat Russian agent was cornering all the<br>foreign refugees in turn and explaining plausibly that this whole affair was an<br>Anarchist plot. I watched him with some interest, for it was the first time that<br>I had seen a person whose profession was telling lies--unless one counts<br>journalists. There was something repulsive in the parody of smart hotel life<br>that was still going on behind shuttered windows amid the rattle of rifle-fire.<br>The front dining-room had been abandoned after a bullet came through the window<br>and chipped a pillar, and the guests were crowded into a darkish room at the<br>back, where there were never quite enough tables to go round. The waiters were<br>reduced in numbers--some of them were C.N.T. members and had joined in the<br>general strike--and had dropped their boiled shirts for the time being, but<br>meals were still being served with a pretence of ceremony. There was, however,<br>practically nothing to eat. On that Thursday night the principal dish at dinner<br>was one sardine each. The hotel had had no bread for days, and even the wine was<br>running so low that we were drinking older and older wines at higher and higher<br>prices. This shortage of food went on for several days after the fighting was<br>over. Three days running, I remember, my wife and I breakfasted off a little<br>piece of goat's-milk cheese with no bread and nothing to drink. The only thing<br>that was plentiful was oranges. The French lorry drivers brought quantities of<br>their oranges into the hotel. They were a tough--looking bunch; they had with<br>them some flashy Spanish girls and a huge porter in a black blouse. At any other<br>time the little snob of a hotel manager would have done his best to make them<br>uncomfortable, in fact would have refused to have them on the premises, but at<br>present they were popular because, unlike the rest of us, they had a private<br>store of bread which everyone was trying to cadge from them.<br><br>I spent that final night on the roof, and the next day it did really look as<br>though the fighting was coming to an end. I do not think there was much firing<br>that day--the Friday. No one seemed to know for certain whether the troops from<br>Valencia were really coining; they arrived that evening, as a matter of fact.<br>The Government was broadcasting half-soothing, half-threatening messages, asking<br>everyone to go home and saying that after a certain hour anyone found carrying<br>arms would be arrested. Not much attention was paid to the Government's<br>broadcasts, but everywhere the people were fading away from the barricades. I<br>have no doubt that it was mainly the food shortage that was responsible. From<br>every side you heard the same remark:' We have no more food, we must go back to<br>work.' On the other hand the Civil Guards, who could count on getting their<br>rations so long as there was any food in the town, were able to stay at their<br>posts. By the afternoon the streets were almost normal, though the deserted<br>barricades were still standing; the Ramblas were thronged with people, the shops<br>nearly all open, and--most reassuring of all--the trams that had stood so long<br>in frozen blocks jerked into motion and began running. The Civil Guards were<br>still holding the Cafe Moka and had not taken down their barricades, but some of<br>them brought chairs out and sat on the pavement with their rifles across their<br>knees. I winked at one of them as I went past and got a not unfriendly grin; he<br>recognized me, of course. Over the Telephone Exchange the Anarchist flag had<br>been hauled down and only the Catalan flag was flying. That meant that the<br>workers were definitely beaten; I realized--though, owing to my political<br>ignorance, not so clearly as I ought to have done--that when the Government<br>felt more sure of itself there would be reprisals. But at the time I was not<br>interested in that aspect of things. All I felt was a profound relief that the<br>devilish din of firing was over, and that one could buy some food and have a bit<br>of rest and peace before going back to the front.<br><br>It must have been late that evening that the troops from Valencia first<br>appeared in the streets. They were the Assault Guards, another formation similar<br>to the Civil Guards and the Carabineros (i.e. a formation intended primarily for<br>police work), and the picked troops of the Republic. Quite suddenly they seemed<br>to spring up out of the ground; you saw them everywhere patrolling the streets<br>in groups of ten--tall men in grey or blue uniforms, with long rifles slung<br>over their shoulders, and a sub-machine-gun to each group. Meanwhile there was a<br>delicate job to be done. The six rifles which we had used for the guard in the<br>observatory towers were still lying there, and by hook or by crook we had got to<br>get them back to the P.O.U.M. building. It was only a question of getting them<br>across the street. They were part of the regular armoury of the building, but to<br>bring them into the street was to contravene the Government's order, and if we<br>were caught with them in our hands we should certainly be arrested--worse, the<br>rifles would be confiscated. With only twenty-one rifles in the building we<br>could not afford to lose six of them. After a lot of discussion as to the best<br>method, a red-haired Spanish boy and myself began to smuggle them out. It was<br>easy enough to dodge the Assault Guard patrols; the danger was the Civil Guards<br>in the Moka, who were well aware that we had rifles in the observatory and might<br>give the show away if they saw us carrying them across. Each of us partially<br>undressed and slung a rifle over the left shoulder, the butt under the armpit,<br>the barrel down the trouser-leg. It was unfortunate that they were long Mausers.<br>Even a man as tall as I am cannot wear a long Mauser down his trouser-leg<br>without discomfort. It was an intolerable job getting down the corkscrew<br>staircase of the observatory with a completely rigid left leg. Once in the<br>street, we found that the only way to move was with extreme slowness, so slowly<br>that you did not have to bend your knees. Outside the picture-house I saw a<br>group of people staring at me with great interest as I crept along at<br>tortoise-speed. I have often wondered what they thought was the matter with me.<br>Wounded in the war, perhaps. However, all the rifles were smuggled across<br>without incident.<br><br>Next day the Assault Guards were everywhere, walking the streets like<br>conquerors. There was no doubt that the Government was simply making a display<br>of force in order to overawe a population which it already knew would not<br>resist; if there had been any real fear of further outbreaks the Assault Guards<br>would have been kept in barracks and not scattered through the streets in small<br>bands. They were splendid troops, much the best I had seen in Spain, and, though<br>I suppose they were in a sense 'the enemy', I could not help liking the look of<br>them. But it was with a sort of amazement that I watched them strolling to and<br>fro. I was used to the ragged, scarcely-armed militia on the Aragon front, and I<br>had not known that the Republic possessed troops like these. It was not only<br>that they were picked men physically, it was their weapons that most astonished<br>me. All of them were armed with brand-new rifles of the type known as 'the<br>Russian rifle' (these rifles were sent to Spain by the U.S.S.R., but were, I<br>believe, manufactured in America). I examined one of them. It was a far from<br>perfect rifle, but vastly better than the dreadful old blunderbusses we had at<br>the front. The Assault Guards had one submachine-gun between ten men and an<br>automatic pistol each; we at the front had approximately one machine-gun between<br>fifty men, and as for pistols and revolvers, you could only procure them<br>illegally. As a matter of fact, though I had not noticed it till now, it was the<br>same everywhere. The Civil Guards and Carabineros, who were not intended for the<br>front at all, were better armed and far better clad than ourselves. I suspect it<br>is the same in all wars--always the same contrast between the sleek police in<br>the rear and the ragged soldiers in the line. On the whole the Assault Guards<br>got on very well with the population after the first day or two. On the first<br>day there was a certain amount of trouble because some of the Assault Guards--<br>acting on instructions, I suppose--began behaving in a provocative manner.<br>Bands of them boarded trams, searched the passengers, and, if they had C.N.T.<br>membership cards in their pockets, tore them up and stamped on them. This led to<br>scuffles with armed Anarchists, and one or two people were killed. Very soon,<br>however, the Assault Guards dropped their conquering air and relations became<br>more friendly. It was noticeable that most of them had picked up a girl after a<br>day or two.<br><br>The Barcelona fighting had given the Valencia Government the long--wanted<br>excuse to assume fuller control of Catalonia. The workers' militias were to be<br>broken' up and redistributed among the Popular Army. The Spanish Republican flag<br>was flying all over Barcelona--the first time I had seen it, I think, except<br>over a Fascist trench. In the working-class quarters the barricades were being<br>pulled down, rather fragmentarily, for it is a lot easier to build a barricade<br>than to put the stones back. Outside the P.S.U.C. buildings the barricades were<br>allowed to remain standing, and indeed many were standing as late as June. The<br>Civil Guards were still occupying strategic points. Huge seizures of arms were<br>being made from C.N.T. strongholds, though I have no doubt a good many escaped<br>seizure. La Batalla was still appearing, but it was censored until the front<br>page was almost completely blank. The P.S.U.C. papers were un-censored and were<br>publishing inflammatory articles demanding the suppression of the P.O.U.M. The<br>P.O.U.M. was declared to be a disguised Fascist organization, and a cartoon<br>representing the P.O.U.M. as a figure slipping off a mask marked with the<br>hammer and sickle and revealing a hideous, maniacal face marked with the<br>swastika, was being circulated all over the town by P.S.U.C. agents. Evidently<br>the official version of the Barcelona fighting was already fixed upon: it was to<br>be represented as a 'fifth column' Fascist rising engineered solely by the<br>P.O.U.M.<br><br>In the hotel the horrible atmosphere of suspicion and hostility had grown<br>worse now that the fighting was over. In the face of the accusations that were<br>being flung about it was impossible to remain neutral. The posts were working<br>again, the foreign Communist papers were beginning to arrive, and their accounts<br>of the fighting were not only violently partisan but, of course, wildly<br>inaccurate as to facts. I think some of the Communists on the spot, who had seen<br>what was actually happening, were dismayed by the interpretation that was being<br>put upon events, but naturally they had to stick to their own side. Our<br>Communist friend approached me once again and asked me whether I would not<br>transfer into the International Column.<br><br>I was rather surprised. 'Your papers are saying I'm a Fascist,' I said.<br>'Surely I should be politically suspect, coming from the P.O.U.M.'<br><br>'Oh, that doesn't matter. After all, you were only acting under orders.'<br><br>I had to tell him that after this affair I could not join any<br>Communist-controlled unit. Sooner or later it might mean being used against the<br>Spanish working class. One could not tell when this kind of thing would break<br>out again, and if I had to use my rifle at all in such an affair I would use it<br>on the side of the working class and not against them. He was very decent about<br>it. But from now on the whole atmosphere was changed. You could not, as before,<br>'agree to differ' and have drinks with a man who was supposedly your political<br>opponent. There were some ugly wrangles in the hotel lounge. Meanwhile the jails<br>were already full and overflowing. After the fighting was over the Anarchists<br>had, of course, released their prisoners, but the Civil Guards had not released<br>theirs, and most of them were thrown into prison and kept there without trial,<br>in many cases for months on end. As usual, completely innocent people were being<br>arrested owing to police bungling. I mentioned earlier that Douglas Thompson was<br>wounded about the beginning of April. Afterwards we had lost touch with him, as<br>usually happened when a man was wounded, for wounded men were frequently moved<br>from one hospital to another. Actually he was at Tarragona hospital and was sent<br>back to Barcelona about the time when the fighting started. On the Tuesday<br>morning I met him in the street, considerably bewildered by the firing that was<br>going on all round. He asked the question everyone was asking:<br><br>'What the devil is this all about?'<br><br>I explained as well as I could. Thompson said promptly:<br><br>'I'm going to keep out of this. My arm's still bad. I shall go back to my<br>hotel and stay there.'<br><br>He went back to his hotel, but unfortunately (how important it is in<br>street-fighting to understand the local geography!) it was a hotel in a part of<br>the town controlled by the Civil Guards. The place was raided and Thompson was<br>arrested, flung into jail, and kept for eight days in a cell so full of people<br>that nobody had room to lie down. There were many similar cases. Numerous<br>foreigners with doubtful political records were on the run, with the police on<br>their track and in constant fear of denunciation. It was worst for the Italians<br>and Germans, who had no passports and were generally wanted by the secret police<br>in their own countries. If they were arrested they were liable to be deported to<br>France, which might mean being sent back to Italy or Germany, where God knew<br>what horrors were awaiting them. One or two foreign women hurriedly regularized<br>their position by 'marrying' Spaniards. A German girl who had no papers at all<br>dodged the police by posing for several days as a man's mistress. I remember the<br>look of shame and misery on the poor girl's face when I accidentally bumped into<br>her coming out of the man's bedroom. Of course she was not his mistress, but no<br>doubt she thought I thought she was. You had all the while a hateful feeling<br>that someone hitherto your friend might be denouncing you to the secret police.<br>The long nightmare of the fighting, the noise, the lack of food and sleep, the<br>mingled strain and boredom of sitting on the roof and wondering whether in<br>another minute I should be shot myself or be obliged to shoot somebody else had<br>put my nerves on edge. I had got to the point when every time a door banged I<br>grabbed for my pistol. On the Saturday morning there was an uproar of shots<br>outside and everyone cried out: 'It's starting again!' I ran into the street to<br>find that it was only some Assault Guards shooting a mad dog. No one who was in<br>Barcelona then, or for months later, will forget the horrible atmosphere<br>produced by fear, suspicion, hatred, censored newspapers, crammed jails,<br>enormous food queues, and prowling gangs of armed men.<br><br>I have tried to give some idea of what it felt like to be in the middle of<br>the Barcelona fighting; yet I do not suppose I have succeeded in conveying much<br>of the strangeness of that time. One of the things that stick in my mind when I<br>look back is the casual contacts one made at the time, the sudden glimpses of<br>non-combatants to whom the whole thing was simply a meaningless uproar. I<br>remember the fashionably-dressed woman I saw strolling down the Ramblas, with a<br>shopping-basket over her arm and leading a white poodle, while the rifles<br>cracked and roared a street or two away. It is conceivable that she was deaf.<br>And the man I saw rushing across the completely empty Plaza de Cataluna,<br>brandishing a white handkerchief in each hand. And the large party of people all<br>dressed in black who kept trying for about an hour to cross the Plaza de<br>Cataluna and always failing. Every time they emerged from the side-street at the<br>corner the P.S.U.C. machine-gunners in the Hotel Colon opened fire and drove<br>them back--I don't know why, for they were obviously unarmed. I have since<br>thought that they may have been a funeral party. And the little man who acted as<br>caretaker at the museum over the Poliorama and who seemed to regard the whole<br>affair as a social occasion. He was so pleased to have the English visiting him<br>--the English were so simpatico, he said. He hoped we would all come and see him<br>again when the trouble was over; as a matter of fact I did go and see him. And<br>the other little man, sheltering in a doorway, who jerked his head in a pleased<br>manner towards the hell of firing on the Plaza de Cataluna and said (as though<br>remarking that it was a fine morning): 'So we've got the nineteenth of July back<br>again!' And the people in the shoe-shop who were making my marching-boots. I<br>went there before the fighting, after it was over, and, for a very few minutes,<br>during the brief armistice on 5 May. It was an expensive shop, and the<br>shop-people were U.G.T. and may have been P.S.U.C. members--at any rate they<br>were politically on the other side and they knew that I was serving with the<br>P.O.U.M. Yet their attitude was completely indifferent. 'Such a pity, this kind<br>of thing, isn't it? And so bad for business. What a pity it doesn't stop! As<br>though there wasn't enough of that kind of thing at the front!' etc., etc. There<br>must have been quantities of people, perhaps a majority of the inhabitants of<br>Barcelona, who regarded the whole affair without a nicker of interest, or with<br>no more interest than they would have felt in an air-raid.<br><br>In this chapter I have described only my personal experiences. In the next<br>chapter I must discuss as best I can the larger issues--what actually happened<br>and with what results, what were the rights and wrongs of the affair, and who if<br>anyone was responsible. So much political capital has been made out of the<br>Barcelona fighting that it is important to try and get a balanced view of it. An<br>immense amount, enough to fill many books, has already been written on the<br>subject, and I do not suppose I should exaggerate if I said that nine-tenths of<br>it is untruthful. Nearly all the newspaper accounts published at the time were<br>manufactured by journalists at a distance, and were not only inaccurate in their<br>facts but intentionally misleading. As usual, only one side of the question has<br>been allowed to get to the wider public. Like everyone who was in Barcelona at<br>the time. I saw only what was happening in my immediate neighbourhood, but I saw<br>and heard quite enough to be able to contradict many of the lies that have been<br>circulated. As before, if you are not interested in political controversy and<br>the mob of parties and sub-parties with their confusing names (rather like the<br>names of the generals in a Chinese war), please skip. It is a horrible thing to<br>have to enter into the details of inter-party polemics; it is like diving into a<br>cesspool. But it is necessary to try and establish the truth, so far as it is<br>possible. This squalid brawl in a distant city is more important than might<br>appear at first sight.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/8.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/10.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
