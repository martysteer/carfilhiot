<h2>Chapter 4</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>WHEN I had been about three weeks in the line a contingent of twenty or<br>thirty men, sent out from England by the I.L.P., arrived at Alcubierre, and in<br>order to keep the English on this front together Williams and I were sent to<br>join them. Our new position was at Monte Oscuro, several miles farther west and<br>within sight of Zaragoza.<br><br>The position was perched on a sort of razor-back of limestone with dug-outs<br>driven horizontally into the cliff like sand-martins' nests. They went into the<br>ground for prodigious distances, and inside they were pitch dark and so low that<br>you could not even kneel in them, let alone stand. On the peaks to the left of<br>us there were two more P.O.U.M. positions, one of them an object of fascination<br>to every man in the line, because there were three militiawomen there who did<br>the cooking. These women were not exactly beautiful, but it was found necessary<br>to put the position out of bounds to men of other companies. Five hundred yards<br>to our right there was a P.S.U.C. post at the bend of the Alcubierre road. It<br>was just here that the road changed hands. At night you could watch the lamps of<br>our supply-lorries winding out from Alcubierre and, simultaneously, those of the<br>Fascists coming from Zaragoza. You could see Zaragoza itself, a thin string of<br>lights like the lighted portholes of a ship, twelve miles south-westward. The<br>Government troops had gazed at it from that distance since August 1936, and they<br>are gazing at it still.<br><br>There were about thirty of ourselves, including one Spaniard (Ramon,<br>Williams's brother-in-law), and there were a dozen Spanish machine--gunners.<br>Apart from the one or two inevitable nuisances--for, as everyone knows, war<br>attracts riff-raff--the English were an exceptionally good crowd, both<br>physically and mentally. Perhaps the best of the bunch was Bob Smillie--the<br>grandson of the famous miners' leader--who afterwards died such an evil and<br>meaningless death in Valencia. It says a lot for the Spanish character that the<br>English and the Spaniards always got on well together, in spite of the language<br>difficulty. All Spaniards, we discovered, knew two English expressions. One was<br>'O.K., baby', the other was a word used by the Barcelona whores in their<br>dealings with English sailors, and I am afraid the compositors would not print<br>it.<br><br>Once again there was nothing happening all along the line: only the random<br>crack of bullets and, very rarely, the crash of a Fascist mortar that sent<br>everyone running to the top trench to see which hill the shells were bursting<br>on. The enemy was somewhat closer to us here, perhaps three or four hundred<br>yards away. Their nearest position was exactly opposite ours, with a machine-gun<br>nest whose loopholes constantly tempted one to waste cartridges. The Fascists<br>seldom bothered with rifle-shots, but sent bursts of accurate machine-gun fire<br>at anyone who exposed himself. Nevertheless it was ten days or more before we<br>had our first casualty. The troops opposite us were Spaniards, but according to<br>the deserters there were a few German N.C.O.S. among them. At some time in the<br>past there had also been Moors there--poor devils, how they must have felt the<br>cold!--for out in no man's land there was a dead Moor who was one of the sights<br>of the locality. A mile or two to the left of us the line ceased to be<br>continuous and there was a tract of country, lower-lying and thickly wooded,<br>which belonged neither to the Fascists nor ourselves. Both we and they used to<br>make daylight patrols there. It was not bad fun in a Boy Scoutish way, though I<br>never saw a Fascist patrol nearer than several hundred yards. By a lot of<br>crawling on your belly you could work your way partly through the Fascist lines<br>and could even see the farm-house flying the monarchist flag, which was the<br>local Fascist headquarters. Occasionally we gave it a rifle-volley and then<br>slipped into cover before the machine-guns could locate us. I hope we broke a<br>few windows, but it was a good eight hundred metres away, and with our rifles<br>you could not make sure of hitting even a house at that range.<br><br>The weather was mostly clear and cold; sometimes sunny at midday, but always<br>cold. Here and there in the soil of the hill-sides you found the green beaks of<br>wild crocuses or irises poking through; evidently spring was coming, but coming<br>very slowly. The nights were colder than ever. Coming off guard in the small<br>hours we used to rake together what was left of the cook-house fire and then<br>stand in the red-hot embers. It was bad for your boots, but it was very good for<br>your feet. But there were mornings when the sight of the dawn among the<br>mountain--tops made it almost worth while to be out of bed at godless hours. I<br>hate mountains, even from a spectacular point of view. But sometimes the dawn<br>breaking behind the hill-tops in our rear, the first narrow streaks of gold,<br>like swords slitting the darkness, and then the growing light and the seas of<br>carmine cloud stretching away into inconceivable distances, were worth watching<br>even when you had been up all night, when your legs were numb from the knees<br>down, and you were sullenly reflecting that there was no hope of food for<br>another three hours. I saw the dawn oftener during this campaign than during the<br>rest of my life put together--or during the part that is to come, I hope.<br><br>We were short-handed here, which meant longer guards and more fatigues. I was<br>beginning to suffer a little from the lack of sleep which is inevitable even in<br>the quietest kind of war. Apart from guard-duties and patrols there were<br>constant night-alarms and stand--to's, and in any case you can't sleep properly<br>in a beastly hole in the ground with your feet aching with the cold. In my first<br>three or four months in the line I do not suppose I had more than a dozen<br>periods of twenty-four hours that were completely without sleep; on the other<br>hand I certainly did not have a dozen nights of full sleep. Twenty or thirty<br>hours' sleep in a week was quite a normal amount. The effects of this were not<br>so bad as might be expected; one grew very stupid, and the job of climbing up<br>and down the hills grew harder instead of easier, but one felt well and one was<br>constantly hungry--heavens, how hungry! All food seemed good, even the eternal<br>haricot beans which everyone in Spain finally learned to hate the sight of. Our<br>water, what there was of it, came from miles away, on the backs of mules or<br>little persecuted donkeys. For some reason the Aragon peasants treated their<br>mules well but their donkeys abominably. If a donkey refused to go it was quite<br>usual to kick him in the testicles. The issue of candles had ceased, and matches<br>were running short. The Spaniards taught us how to make olive oil lamps out of a<br>condensed milk tin, a cartridge-clip, and a bit of rag. When you had any olive<br>oil, which was not often, these things would burn with a smoky flicker, about a<br>quarter candle power, just enough to find your rifle by.<br><br>There seemed no hope of any real fighting. When we left Monte Pocero I had<br>counted my cartridges and found that in nearly three weeks I had fired just<br>three shots at the enemy. They say it takes a thousand bullets to kill a man,<br>and at this rate it would be twenty years before I killed my first Fascist. At<br>Monte Oscuro the lines were closer and one fired oftener, but I am reasonably<br>certain that I never hit anyone. As a matter of fact, on this front and at this<br>period of the war the real weapon was not the rifle but the megaphone. Being<br>unable to kill your enemy you shouted at him instead. This method of warfare is<br>so extraordinary that it needs explaining.<br><br>Wherever the lines were within hailing distance of one another there was<br>always a good deal of shouting from trench to trench. From ourselves: 'Fascistas<br>--maricones!' From the Fascists: ''Viva Espana! Viva Franco!'--or, when they<br>knew that there were English opposite them: 'Go home, you English! We don't want<br>foreigners here!' On the Government side, in the party militias, the shouting of<br>propaganda to undermine the enemy morale had been developed into a regular<br>technique. In every suitable position men, usually machine-gunners, were told<br>off for shouting-duty and provided with megaphones. Generally they shouted a<br>set-piece, full of revolutionary sentiments which explained to the Fascist<br>soldiers that they were merely the hirelings of international capitalism, that<br>they were fighting against their own class, etc., etc., and urged them to come<br>over to our side. This was repeated over and over by relays of men; sometimes it<br>continued almost the whole night. There is very little doubt that it had its<br>effect; everyone agreed that the trickle of Fascist deserters was partly caused<br>by it. If one comes to think of it, when some poor devil of a sentry--very<br>likely a Socialist or Anarchist trade union member who has been conscripted<br>against his will--is freezing at his post, the slogan 'Don't fight against your<br>own class!' ringing again and again through the darkness is bound to make an<br>impression on him. It might make just the difference between deserting and not<br>deserting. Of course such a proceeding does not fit in with the English<br>conception of war. I admit I was amazed and scandalized when I first saw it<br>done. The idea of trying to convert your enemy instead of shooting him! I now<br>think that from any point of view it was a legitimate manoeuvre. In ordinary<br>trench warfare, when there is no artillery, it is extremely difficult to inflict<br>casualties on the enemy without receiving an equal number yourself. If you can<br>immobilize a certain number of men by making them desert, so much the better;<br>deserters are actually more useful to you than corpses, because they can give<br>information. But at the beginning it dismayed all of us; it made us fed that the<br>Spaniards were not taking this war of theirs sufficiently seriously. The man who<br>did the shouting at the P.S.U.C. post down on our right was an artist at the<br>job. Sometimes, instead of shouting revolutionary slogans he simply told the<br>Fascists how much better we were fed than they were. His account of the<br>Government rations was apt to be a little imaginative.' Buttered toast!'--you<br>could hear his voice echoing across the lonely valley--'We're just sitting down<br>to buttered toast over here! Lovely slices of buttered toast!' I do not doubt<br>that, like the rest of us, he had not seen butter for weeks or months past, but<br>in the icy night the news of buttered toast probably set many a Fascist mouth<br>watering. It even made mine water, though I knew he was lying.<br><br>One day in February we saw a Fascist aeroplane approaching. As usual, a<br>machine-gun was dragged into the open and its barrel cocked up, and everyone lay<br>on his back to get a good aim. Our isolated positions were not worth bombing,<br>and as a rule the few Fascist aeroplanes that passed our way circled round to<br>avoid machine-gun fire. This time the aeroplane came straight over, too high up<br>to be worth shooting at, and out of it came tumbling not bombs but white<br>glittering things that turned over and over in the air. A few fluttered down<br>into the position. They were copies of a Fascist newspaper, the Heraldo de<br>Aragon, announcing the fall of Malaga.<br><br>That night the Fascists made a sort of abortive attack. I was just getting<br>down into kip, half dead with sleep, when there was a heavy stream of bullets<br>overhead and someone shouted into the dug-out: 'They're attacking!' I grabbed my<br>rifle and slithered up to my post, which was at the top of the position, beside<br>the machine-gun. There was utter darkness and diabolical noise. The fire of, I<br>think five machine-guns was pouring upon us, and there was a series of heavy<br>crashes caused by the Fascists flinging bombs over their own parapet in the most<br>idiotic manner. It was intensely dark. Down in the valley to the left of us I<br>could see the greenish flash of rifles where a small party of Fascists, probably<br>a patrol, were chipping in. The bullets were flying round us in the darkness,<br>crack-zip-crack. A few shells came whistling over, but they fell nowhere near us<br>and (as usual in this war) most of them failed to explode. I had a bad moment<br>when yet another machine-gun opened fire from the hill-top in our rear--<br>actually a gun that had been brought up to support us, but at the time it looked<br>as though we were surrounded. .Presently our own machine-gun jammed, as it<br>always did jam with those vile cartridges, and the ramrod was lost in the<br>impenetrable darkness. Apparently there was nothing that one could do except<br>stand still and be shot at. The Spanish machine-gunners disdained to take cover,<br>in fact exposed themselves deliberately, so I had to do likewise. Petty though<br>it was, the whole experience was very interesting. It was the first time that I<br>had been properly speaking under fire, and to my humiliation I found that I was<br>horribly frightened. You always, I notice, feel the same when you are under<br>heavy fire--not so much afraid of being hit as afraid because you don't know<br>where you will be hit. You are wondering all the while just where the bullet<br>will nip you, and it gives your whole body a most unpleasant sensitiveness.<br><br>After an hour or two the firing slowed down and died away. Meanwhile we had<br>had only one casualty. The Fascists had advanced a couple of machine-guns into<br>no man's land, but they had kept a safe distance and made no attempt to storm<br>our parapet. They were in fact not attacking, merely wasting cartridges and<br>making a cheerful noise to celebrate the fall of Malaga. The chief importance of<br>the affair was that it taught me to read the war news in the papers with a more<br>disbelieving eye. A day or two later the newspapers and the radio published<br>reports of a tremendous attack with cavalry and tanks (up a perpendicular hill--<br>side!) which had been beaten off by the heroic English.<br><br>When the Fascists told us that Malaga had fallen we set it down as a lie, but<br>next day there were more convincing rumours, and it must have been a day or two<br>later that it was admitted officially. By degrees the whole disgraceful story<br>leaked out--how the town had been evacuated without firing a shot, and how the<br>fury of the Italians had fallen not upon the troops, who were gone, but upon the<br>wretched civilian population, some of whom were pursued and machine-gunned for a<br>hundred miles. The news sent a sort of chill all along the line, for, whatever<br>the truth may have been, every man in the militia believed that the loss of<br>Malaga was due to treachery. It was the first talk I had heard of treachery or<br>divided aims. It set up in my mind the first vague doubts about this war in<br>which, hitherto, the rights and wrongs had seemed so beautifully simple.<br><br>In mid February we left Monte Oscuro and were sent, together with all the<br>P.O.U.M. troops in this sector, to make a part of the army besieging Huesca. It<br>was a fifty-mile lorry journey across the wintry plain, where the clipped vines<br>were not yet budding and the blades of the winter barley were just poking<br>through the lumpy soil. Four kilometres from our new trenches Huesca glittered<br>small and clear like a city of dolls' houses. Months earlier, when Sietamo was<br>taken, the general commanding the Government troops had said gaily: 'Tomorrow<br>we'll have coffee in Huesca.' It turned out that he was mistaken. There had been<br>bloody attacks, but the town did not fall, and 'Tomorrow we'll have coffee in<br>Huesca' had become a standing joke throughout the army.
