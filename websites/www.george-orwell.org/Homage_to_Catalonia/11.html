<h2>Chapter 12</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>IT must have been three days after the Barcelona fighting ended that we<br>returned to the front. After the fighting--more particularly after the<br>slanging-match in the newspapers--it was difficult to think about this war in<br>quite the same naively idealistic manner as before. I suppose there is no one<br>who spent more than a few weeks in Spain without being in some degree<br>disillusioned. My mind went back to the newspaper correspondent whom I had met<br>my first day in Barcelona, and who said to me: 'This war is a racket the same as<br>any other.' The remark had shocked me deeply, and at that time (December) I do<br>not believe it was true; it was not true even now, in May; but it was becoming<br>truer. The fact is that every war suffers a kind of progressive degradation with<br>every month that it continues, because such things as individual liberty and a<br>truthful press are simply not compatible with military efficiency.<br><br>One could begin now to make some kind of guess at what was likely to happen.<br>It was easy to see that the Caballero Government would fall and be replaced by a<br>more Right-wing Government with a stronger Communist influence (this happened a<br>week or two later), which would set itself to break the power of the trade<br>unions once and for all. And afterwards, when Franco was beaten--and putting<br>aside the huge problems raised by the reorganization of Spain--the prospect was<br>not rosy. As for the newspaper talk about this being a 'war for democracy', it<br>was plain eyewash. No one in his senses supposed that there was any hope of<br>democracy, even as we understand it in England or France, in a country so<br>divided and exhausted as Spain would be when the war was over. It would have to<br>be a dictatorship, and it was clear that the chance of a working-class<br>dictatorship had passed. That meant that the general movement would be in the<br>direction of some kind of Fascism. Fascism called, no doubt, by some politer<br>name, and--because this was Spain--more human and less efficient than the<br>German or Italian varieties. The only alternatives were an infinitely worse<br>dictatorship by Franco, or (always a possibility) that the war would end with<br>Spain divided up, either by actual frontiers or into economicszones.<br><br>Whichever way you took it it was a depressing outlook. But it did not follow<br>that the Government was not worth fighting for as against the more naked and<br>developed Fascism of Franco and Hitler. Whatever faults the post-war Government<br>might have, Franco's regime would certainly be worse. To the workers--the town<br>proletariat--it might in the end make very little difference who won, but Spain<br>is primarily an agricultural country and the peasants would almost certainly<br>benefit by a Government victory. Some at least of the seized lands would remain<br>in their possession, in which case there would also be a distribution of land in<br>the territory that had been Franco's, and the virtual serfdom that had existed<br>in some parts of Spain was not likely to be restored. The Government in control<br>at the end of the war would at any rate be anti-clerical and anti-feudal. It<br>would keep the Church in check, at least for the time being, and would modernize<br>the country--build roads, for instance, and promote education and public<br>health; a certain amount had been done in this direction even during the war.<br>Franco, on the other hand, in so far as he was not merely the puppet of Italy<br>and Germany, was tied to the big feudal landlords and stood for a stuffy<br>clerico-military reaction. The Popular Front might be a swindle, but Franco was<br>an anachronism. Only millionaires or romantics could want him to win.<br><br>Moreover, there was the question of the international prestige of Fascism,<br>which for a year or two past had been haunting me like a nightmare. Since 1930<br>the Fascists had won all the victories; it was time they got a beating, it<br>hardly mattered from whom. If we could drive Franco and his foreign mercenaries<br>into the sea it might make an immense improvement in the world situation, even<br>if Spain itself emerged with a stifling dictatorship and all its best men in<br>jail. For that alone the war would have been worth winning.<br><br>This was how I saw things at the time. I may say that I now think much more<br>highly of the Negrin Government than I did when it came into office. It has kept<br>up the difficult fight with splendid courage, and it has shown more political<br>tolerance than anyone expected. But I still believe that--unless Spain splits<br>up, with unpredictable consequences--the tendency of the post-war Government is<br>bound to be Fascistic. Once again I let this opinion stand, and take the chance<br>that time will do to me what it does to most prophets.<br><br>We had just reached the front when we heard that Bob Smillie, on his way back<br>to England, had been arrested at the frontier, taken down to Valencia, and<br>thrown into jail. Smillie had been in Spain since the previous October. He had<br>worked for several months at the P.O.U.M. office and had then joined the militia<br>when the other I.L.P. members arrived, on the understanding that he was to do<br>three months at the front before going back to England to take part in a<br>propaganda tour. It was some time before we could discover what he had been<br>arrested for. He was being kept incommunicado, so that not even a lawyer could<br>see him. In Spain there is--at any rate in practice--no habeas corpus, and you<br>can be kept in jail for months at a stretch without even being charged, let<br>alone tried. Finally we learned from a released prisoner that Smillie had been<br>arrested for 'carrying arms'. The 'arms', as I happened to know, were two<br>hand-grenades of the primitive type used at the beginning of the war, which he<br>had been taking home to show off at his lectures, along with shell splinters and<br>other souvenirs. The charges and fuses had been removed from them--they were<br>mere cylinders of steel and completely harmless. It was obvious that this was<br>only a pretext and that he had been arrested because of his known connexion with<br>the P.O.U.M. The Barcelona fighting had only just ended and the authorities<br>were, at that moment, extremely anxious not to let anyone out of Spain who was<br>in a position to contradict the official version. As a result people were liable<br>to be arrested at the frontier on more or less frivolous pretexts. Very possibly<br>the intention, at the beginning, was only to detain Smillie for a few days. But<br>the trouble is that, in Spain, once you are in jail you generally stay there,<br>with or without trial.<br><br>We were still at Huesca, but they had placed us further to the right,<br>opposite the Fascist redoubt which we had temporarily captured a few weeks<br>earlier. I was now acting as teniente--corresponding to second-lieutenant in<br>the British Army, I suppose--in command of about thirty men, English and<br>Spanish. They had sent my name in for a regular commission; whether I should get<br>it was uncertain. Previously the militia officers had refused to accept regular<br>commissions, which meant extra pay and conflicted with the equalitarian ideas of<br>the militia, but they were now obliged to do so. Benjamin had already been<br>gazetted captain and Kopp was in process of being gazetted major. The Government<br>could not, of course, dispense with the militia officers, but it was not<br>confirming any of them in a higher rank than major, presumably in order to keep<br>the higher commands for Regular Army officers and the new officers from the<br>School of War. As a result, in our division, the agth, and no doubt in many<br>others, you had the queer temporary situation of the divisional commander, the<br>brigade commanders, and the battalion commanders all being majors.<br><br>There was not much happening at the front. The battle round the Jaca road had<br>died away and did not begin again till mid June. In our position the chief<br>trouble was the snipers. The Fascist trenches were more than a hundred and fifty<br>yards away, but they were on higher ground and were on two sides of us, our line<br>forming a right-angle salient. The corner of the salient was a dangerous spot;<br>there had always been a toll of sniper casualties there. From time to time the<br>Fascists let fly at us with a rifle-grenade or some similar weapon. It made a<br>ghastly crash--unnerving, because you could not hear it coming in time to dodge<br>--but was not really dangerous; the hole it blew in the ground was no bigger<br>than a wash-tub. The nights were pleasantly warm, the days blazing hot, the<br>mosquitoes were becoming a nuisance, and in spite of the clean clothes we had<br>brought from Barcelona we were almost immediately lousy. Out in the deserted<br>orchards in no man's land the cherries were whitening on the trees. For two days<br>there were torrential rains, the dug-outs flooded, and the parapet sank a foot;<br>after that there were more days of digging out the sticky clay with the wretched<br>Spanish spades which have no handles and bend like tin spoons.<br><br>They had promised us a trench-mortar for the company; I was looking forward<br>to it gready. At nights we patrolled as usual--more dangerous than it used to<br>be, because the Fascist trenches were better manned and they had grown more<br>alert; they had scattered tin cans just outside their wire and used to open up<br>with the machine-guns when they heard a clank. In the daytime we sniped from no<br>man's land. By crawling a hundred yards you could get to a ditch, hidden by tall<br>grasses, which commanded a gap in the Fascist parapet. We had set up a<br>rifle-rest in the ditch. If you waited long enough you generally saw a<br>khaki-clad figure slip hurriedly across the gap. I had several shots. I don't<br>know whether I hit anyone--it is most unlikely; I am a very poor shot with a<br>rifle. But it was rather fun, the Fascists did not know where the shots were<br>coming from, and I made sure I would get one of them sooner or later. However,<br>the dog it was that died--a Fascist sniper got me instead. I had been about ten<br>days at the front when it happened. The whole experience of being hit by a<br>bullet is very interesting and I think it is worth describing in detail.<br><br>It was at the corner of the parapet, at five o'clock in the morning. This was<br>always a dangerous time, because we had the dawn at our backs, and if you stuck<br>your head above the parapet it was clearly outlined against the sky. I was<br>talking to the sentries preparatory to changing the guard. Suddenly, in the very<br>middle of saying something, I felt--it is very hard to describe what I felt,<br>though I remember it with the utmost vividness.<br><br>Roughly speaking it was the sensation of being at the centre of an explosion.<br>There seemed to be a loud bang and a blinding flash of light all round me, and I<br>felt a tremendous shock--no pain, only a violent shock, such as you get from an<br>electric terminal; with it a sense of utter weakness, a feeling of being<br>stricken and shrivelled up to nothing. The sand-bags in front of me receded into<br>immense distance. I fancy you would feel much the same if you were struck by<br>lightning. I knew immediately that I was hit, but because of the seeming bang<br>and flash I thought it was a rifle nearby that had gone off accidentally and<br>shot me. All this happened in a space of time much less than a second. The next<br>moment my knees crumpled up and I was falling, my head hitting the ground with a<br>violent bang which, to my relief, did not hurt. I had a numb, dazed feeling, a<br>consciousness of being very badly hurt, but no pain in the ordinary sense.<br><br>The American sentry I had been talking to had started forward. 'Gosh! Are you<br>hit?' People gathered round. There was the usual fuss--'Lift him up! Where's he<br>hit? Get his shirt open!' etc., etc. The American called for a knife to cut my<br>shirt open. I knew that there was one in my pocket and tried to get it out, but<br>discovered that my right arm was paralysed. Not being in pain, I felt a vague<br>satisfaction. This ought to please my wife, I thought; she had always wanted me<br>to be wounded, which would save me from being killed when the great battle came.<br>It was only now that it occurred to me to wonder where I was hit, and how badly;<br>I could feel nothing, but I was conscious that the bullet had struck me<br>somewhere in the front of the body. When I tried to speak I found that I had no<br>voice, only a faint squeak, but at the second attempt I managed to ask where I<br>was hit. In the throat, they said. Harry Webb, our stretcher-bearer, had brought<br>a bandage and one of the little bottles of alcohol they gave us for<br>field-dressings. As they lifted me up a lot of blood poured out of my mouth, and<br>I heard a Spaniard behind me say that the bullet had gone clean through my neck.<br>I felt the alcohol, which at ordinary times would sting like the devil, splash<br>on to the wound as a pleasant coolness.<br><br>They laid me down again while somebody fetched a stretcher. As soon as I knew<br>that the bullet had gone clean through my neck I took it for granted that I was<br>done for. I had never heard of a man or an animal getting a bullet through the<br>middle of the neck and surviving it. The blood was dribbling out of the comer of<br>my mouth. 'The artery's gone,' I thought. I wondered how long you last when your<br>carotid artery is cut; not many minutes, presumably. Everything was very blurry.<br>There must have been about two minutes during which I assumed that I was killed.<br>And that too was interesting--I mean it is interesting to know what your<br>thoughts would be at such a time. My first thought, conventionally enough, was<br>for my wife. My second was a violent resentment at having to leave this world<br>which, when all is said and done, suits me so well. I had time to feel this very<br>vividly. The stupid mischance infuriated me. The meaninglessness of it! To be<br>bumped off, not even in battle, but in this stale comer of the trenches, thanks<br>to a moment's carelessness! I thought, too, of the man who had shot me--<br>wondered what he was like, whether he was a Spaniard or a foreigner, whether he<br>knew he had got me, and so forth. I could not feel any resentment against him. I<br>reflected that as he was a Fascist I would have killed him if I could, but that<br>if he had been taken prisoner and brought before me at this moment I would<br>merely have congratulated him on his good shooting. It may be, though, that if<br>you were really dying your thoughts would be quite different.<br><br>They had just got me on to the stretcher when my paralysed right arm came to<br>life and began hurting damnably. At the time I imagined that I must have broken<br>it in falling; but the pain reassured me, for I knew that your sensations do not<br>become more acute when you are dying. I began to feel more normal and to be<br>sorry for the four poor devils who were sweating and slithering with the<br>stretcher on their shoulders. It was a mile and a half to the ambulance, and<br>vile going, over lumpy, slippery tracks. I knew what a sweat it was, having<br>helped to carry a wounded man down a day or two earlier. The leaves of the<br>silver poplars which, in places, fringed our trenches brushed against my face; I<br>thought what a good thing it was to be alive in a world where silver poplars<br>grow. But all the while the pain in my arm was diabolical, making me swear and<br>then try not to swear, because every time I breathed too hard the blood bubbled<br>out of my mouth.<br><br>The doctor re-bandaged the wound, gave me a shot of morphia, and sent me off<br>to Sietamo. The hospitals at Sietamo were hurriedly constructed wooden huts<br>where the wounded were, as a rule, only kept for a few hours before being sent<br>on to Barbastro or Lerida. I was dopey from morphia but still in great pain,<br>practically unable to move and swallowing blood constantly. It was typical of<br>Spanish hospital methods that while I was in this state the untrained nurse<br>tried to force the regulation hospital meal--a huge meal of soup, eggs, greasy<br>stew, and so forth--down my throat and seemed surprised when I would not take<br>it. I asked for a cigarette, but this was one of the periods of tobacco famine<br>and there was not a cigarette in the place. Presently two comrades who had got<br>permission to leave the line for a few hours appeared at my bedside.<br><br>'Hullo! You're alive, are you? Good. We want your watch and your revolver and<br>your electric torch. And your knife, if you've got one.'<br><br>They made off with all my portable possessions. This always happened when a<br>man was wounded--everything he possessed was promptly divided up; quite<br>rightly, for watches, revolvers, and so forth were precious at the front and if<br>they went down the line in a wounded man's kit they were certain to be stolen<br>somewhere on the way.<br><br>By the evening enough sick and wounded had trickled in to make up a few<br>ambulance-loads, and they sent us on to Barbastro. What a journey! It used to be<br>said that in this war you got well if you were wounded in the extremities, but<br>always died of a wound in the abdomen. I now realized why. No one who was liable<br>to bleed internally could have survived those miles of jolting over metal roads<br>that had been smashed to pieces by heavy lorries and never repaired since the<br>war began. Bang, bump, wallop! It took me back to my early childhood and a<br>dreadful thing called the Wiggle-Woggle at the White City Exhibition. They had<br>forgotten to tie us into the stretchers. I had enough strength in my left arm to<br>hang on, but one poor wretch was spilt on to the floor and suffered God knows<br>what agonies. Another, a walking case who was sitting in the corner of the<br>ambulance, vomited all over the place. The hospital in Barbastro was very<br>crowded, the beds so close together that they were almost touching. Next morning<br>they loaded a number of us on to the hospital train and sent us down to<br>Lerida.<br><br>I was five or six days in Lerida. It was a big hospital, with sick, wounded,<br>and ordinary civilian patients more or less jumbled up together. Some of the men<br>in my ward had frightful wounds. In the next bed to me there was a youth with<br>black hair who was suffering from some disease or other and was being given<br>medicine that made his urine as green as emerald. His bed-bottle was one of the<br>sights of the ward. An English-speaking Dutch Communist, having heard that there<br>was an Englishman in the hospital, befriended me and brought me English<br>newspapers. He had been ter-ribly wounded in the October fighting, and had<br>somehow managed to settle down at Lerida hospital and had married one of the<br>nurses. Thanks to his wound, one of his legs had shrivelled till it was no<br>thicker than my arm. Two militiamen on leave, whom I had met my first week at<br>the front, came in to see a wounded friend and recognized me. They were kids of<br>about eighteen. They stood awkwardly beside my bed, trying to think of something<br>to say, and then, as a way of demonstrating that they were sorry I was wounded,<br>suddenly took all the tobacco out of their pockets, gave it to me, and fled<br>before I could give it back. How typically Spanish! I discovered afterwards that<br>you could not buy tobacco anywhere in the town and what they had given me was a<br>week's ration.<br><br>After a few days I was able to get up and walk about with my arm in a sling.<br>For some reason it hurt much more when it hung down. I also had, for the time<br>being, a good deal of internal pain from the damage I had done myself in<br>falling, and my voice had disappeared almost completely, but I never had a<br>moment's pain from the bullet wound itself. It seems this is usually the case.<br>The tremendous shock of a bullet prevents sensation locally; a splinter of shell<br>or bomb, which is jagged and usually hits you less hard, would probably hurt<br>like the devil. There was a pleasant garden in the hospital grounds, and in it<br>was a pool with gold-fishes and some small dark grey fish--bleak, I think. I<br>used to sit watching them for hours. The way things were done at Lerida gave me<br>an insight into the hospital system on the Aragon front--whether it was the<br>same on other fronts I do not know. In some ways the hospitals were very good.<br>The doctors were able men and there seemed to be no shortage of drugs and<br>equipment. But there were two bad faults on account of which, I have no doubt,<br>hundreds or thousands of men have died who might have been saved.<br><br>One was the fact that all the hospitals anywhere near the front line were<br>used more or less as casualty clearing-stations. The result was that you got no<br>treatment there unless you were too badly wounded to be moved. In theory most of<br>the wounded were sent straight to Barcelona or Tarragona, but owing to the lack<br>of transport they were often a week or ten days in getting there. They were kept<br>hanging about at Sietamo, Barbastro, Monzon, Lerida, and other places, and<br>meanwhile they were getting no treatment except an occasional clean bandage,<br>sometimes not even that. Men with dreadful shell wounds, smashed bones, and so<br>forth, were swathed in a sort of casing made of bandages and plaster of Paris; a<br>description of the wound was written in pencil on the outside, and as a rule the<br>casing was not removed till the man reached Barcelona or Tarragona ten days<br>later. It was almost impossible to get one's wound examined on the way; the few<br>doctors could not cope with the work, and they simply walked hurriedly past your<br>bed, saying: 'Yes, yes, they'll attend to you at Barcelona.' There were always<br>rumours that the hospital train was leaving for Barcelona manana. The other<br>fault was the lack of competent nurses. Apparently there was no supply of<br>trained nurses in Spain, perhaps because before the war this work was done<br>chiefly by nuns. I have no complaint against the Spanish nurses, they always<br>treated me with the greatest kindness, but there is no doubt that they were<br>terribly ignorant. All of them knew how to take a temperature, and some of them<br>knew how to tie a bandage, but that was about all. The result was that men who<br>were too ill to fend for themselves were often shamefully neglected. The nurses<br>would let a man remain constipated for a week on end, and they seldom washed<br>those who were too weak to wash themselves. I remember one poor devil with a<br>smashed arm telling me that he had been three weeks without having his face<br>washed. Even beds were left unmade for days together. The food in all the<br>hospitals was very good--too good, indeed. Even more in Spain than elsewhere it<br>seemed to be the tradition to stuff sick people with heavy food. At Lerida the<br>meals were terrific. Breakfast, at about six in the morning, consisted of soup,<br>an omelette, stew, bread, white wine, and coffee, and lunch was even larger--<br>this at a time when most of the civil population was seriously underfed.<br>Spaniards seem not to recognize such a thing as a light diet. They give the same<br>food to sick people as to well ones--always the same rich, greasy cookery, with<br>everything sodden in olive oil.<br><br>One morning it was announced that the men in my ward were to be sent down to<br>Barcelona today. I managed to send a wire to my wife, telling her that I was<br>coming, and presently they packed us into buses and took us down to the station.<br>It was only when the train was actually starting that the hospital orderly who<br>travelled with us casually let fall that we were not going to Barcelona after<br>all, but to Tarragona. I suppose the engine-driver had changed his mind. 'Just<br>like Spain!' I thought. But it was very Spanish, too, that they agreed to hold<br>up the train while I sent another wire, and more Spanish still that the wire<br>never got there.<br><br>They had put us into ordinary third-class carriages with wooden seats, and<br>many of the men were badly wounded and had only got out of bed for the first<br>time that morning. Before long, what with the heat and the jolting, half of them<br>were in a state of collapse and several vomited on the floor. The hospital<br>orderly threaded his way among the corpse--like forms that sprawled everywhere,<br>carrying a large goatskin bottle full of water which he squirted into this mouth<br>or that. It was beastly water; I remember the taste of it still. We got into<br>Tarragona as the sun was getting low. The line runs along the shore a stone's<br>throw from the sea. As our train drew into the station a troop-train full of men<br>from the International Column was drawing out, and a knot of people on the<br>bridge were waving to them. It was a very long train, packed to bursting-point<br>with men, with field-guns lashed on the open trucks and more men clustering<br>round the guns. I remember with peculiar vividness the spectacle of that train<br>passing in the yellow evening light; window after window full of dark, smiling<br>faces, the long tilted barrels of the guns, the scarlet scarves fluttering--all<br>this gliding slowly past us against a turquoise-coloured sea.<br><br>'Extranjeros--foreigners,' said someone. 'They're Italians. 'Obviously they<br>were Italians. No other people could have grouped themselves so picturesquely or<br>returned the salutes of the crowd with so much grace--a grace that was none the<br>less because about half the men on the train were drinking out of up-ended wine<br>bottles. We heard afterwards that these were some of the troops who won the<br>great victory at Guadalajara in March; they had been on leave and were being<br>transferred to the Aragon front. Most of them, I am afraid, were killed at<br>Huesca only a few weeks later. The men who were well enough to stand had moved<br>across the carriage to cheer the Italians as they went past. A crutch waved out<br>of the window; bandaged forearms made the Red Salute. It was like an allegorical<br>picture of war; the trainload of fresh men gliding proudly up the line, the<br>maimed men sliding slowly down, and all the while the guns on the open trucks<br>making one's heart leap as guns always do, and reviving that pernicious feeling,<br>so difficult to get rid of, that war is glorious after all.<br><br>The hospital at Tarragona was a very big one and full of wounded from all<br>fronts. What wounds one saw there! They had a way of treating certain wounds<br>which I suppose was in accordance with the latest medical practice, but which<br>was peculiarly horrible to look at. This was to leave the wound completely open<br>and unbandaged, but protected from flies by a net of butter-muslin, stretched<br>over wires. Under the muslin you would see the red jelly of a half-healed wound.<br>There was one man wounded in the face and throat who had his head inside a sort<br>of spherical helmet of butter-muslin; his mouth was closed up and he breathed<br>through a little tube that was fixed between his lips. Poor devil, he looked so<br>lonely, wandering to and fro, looking at you through his muslin cage and unable<br>to speak. I was three or four days at Tarragona. My strength was coming back,<br>and one day, by going slowly, I managed to walk down as far as the beach. It was<br>queer to see the seaside life going on almost as usual; the smart cafes along<br>the promenade and the plump local bourgeoisie bathing and sunning themselves in<br>deck-chairs as though there had not been a war within a thousand miles.<br>Nevertheless, as it happened, I saw a bather drowned, which one would have<br>thought impossible in that shallow and tepid sea.<br><br>Finally, eight or nine days after leaving the front, I had my wound examined.<br>In the surgery where newly-arrived cases were examined, doctors with huge pairs<br>of shears were hacking away the breast-plates of plaster in which men with<br>smashed ribs, collar-bones, and so forth had been cased at the dressing-stations<br>behind the line; out of the neck-hole of the huge clumsy breast-plate you would<br>see protruding an anxious, dirty face, scrubby with a week's beard. The doctor,<br>a brisk, handsome man of about thirty, sat me down in a chair, grasped my tongue<br>with a piece of rough gauze, pulled it out as far as it would go, thrust a<br>dentist's mirror down my throat, and told me to say 'Eh!' After doing this till<br>my tongue was bleeding and my eyes running with water, he told me that one vocal<br>cord was paralysed.<br><br>'When shall I get my voice back?' I said.<br><br>'Your voice? Oh, you'll never get your voice back,' he said cheerfully.<br><br>However, he was wrong, as it turned out. For about two months I could not<br>speak much above a whisper, but after that my voice became normal rather<br>suddenly, the other vocal cord having 'compensated'. The pain in my arm was due<br>to the bullet having pierced a bunch of nerves at the back of the neck. It was a<br>shooting pain like neuralgia, and it went on hurting continuously for about a<br>month, especially at night, so that I did not get much sleep. The fingers of my<br>right hand were also semi-paralysed. Even now, five months afterwards, my<br>forefinger is still numb--a queer effect for a neck wound to have.<br><br>The wound was a curiosity in a small way and various doctors examined it with<br>much clicking of tongues and 'Que suerte! Qye suerte!' One of them told me with<br>an air of authority that the bullet had missed the artery by 'about a<br>millimetre'. I don't know how he knew. No one I met at this time--doctors,<br>nurses, practicantes, or fellow-patients--failed to assure me that a man who is<br>hit through the neck and survives it is the luckiest creature alive. I could not<br>help thinking that it would be even luckier not to be hit at all.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/10.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/12.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
