<h2>Chapter 3</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>IN trench warfare five things are important: firewood, food, tobacco,<br>candles, and the enemy. In winter on the Zaragoza front they were important in<br>that order, with the enemy a bad last. Except at night, when a surprise--attack<br>was always conceivable, nobody bothered about the enemy. They were simply remote<br>black insects whom one occasionally saw hopping to and fro. The real<br>preoccupation of both armies was trying to keep warm.<br><br>I ought to say in passing that all the time I was in Spain I saw very little<br>fighting. I was on the Aragon front from January to May, and between January and<br>late March little or nothing happened on that front, except at Teruel. In March<br>there was heavy fighting round Huesca, but I personally played only a minor part<br>in it. Later, in June, there was the disastrous attack on Huesca in which<br>several thousand men were killed in a single day, but I had been wounded and<br>disabled before that happened. The things that one normally thinks of as the<br>horrors of war seldom happened to me. No aeroplane ever dropped a bomb anywhere<br>near me, I do not think a shell ever exploded within fifty yards of me, and I<br>was only in hand-to-hand fighting once (once is once too often, I may say). Of<br>course I was often under heavy machine-gun fire, but usually at longish. ranges.<br>Even at Huesca you were generally safe enough if you took reasonable<br>precautions.<br><br>Up here, in the hills round Zaragoza, it was simply the mingled boredom and<br>discomfort of stationary warfare. A life as uneventful as a city clerk's, and<br>almost as regular. Sentry-go, patrols, digging; digging, patrols, sentry-go. On<br>every hill-top. Fascist or Loyalist, a knot of ragged, dirty men shivering round<br>their flag and trying to keep warm. And all day and night the meaningless<br>bullets wandering across the empty valleys and only by some rare improbable<br>chance getting home on a human body.<br><br>Often I used to gaze round the wintry landscape and marvel at the futility of<br>it all. The inconclusiveness of such a kind of war! Earlier, about October,<br>there had been savage fighting for all these hills; then, because the lack of<br>men and arms, especially artillery, made any large-scale operation impossible,<br>each army had dug itself in and settled down on the hill-tops it had won. Over<br>to our right there was a small outpost, also P.O.U.M., and on the spur to our<br>left, at seven o'clock of us, a P.S.U.C. position faced a taller spur with<br>several small Fascist posts dotted on its peaks. The so-called line zigzagged to<br>and fro in a pattern that would have been quite unintelligible if every position<br>had not flown a flag. The P.O.U.M. and P.S.U.C. flags were red, those of the<br>Anarchists red and black; the Fascists generally flew the monarchist flag<br>(red-yellow-red), but occasionally they flew the flag of the Republic<br>(red-yellow-purple). The scenery was stupendous, if you could forget that every<br>mountain--top was occupied by troops and was therefore littered with tin cans<br>and crusted with dung. To the right of us the sierra bent south--eastwards and<br>made way for the wide, veined valley that stretched across to Huesca. In the<br>middle of the plain a few tiny cubes sprawled like a throw of dice; this was the<br>town of Robres, which was in Loyalist possession. Often in the mornings the<br>valley was hidden under seas of cloud, out of which the hills rose flat and<br>blue, giving the landscape a strange resemblance to a photographic negative.<br>Beyond Huesca there were more hills of the same formation as our own, streaked<br>with a pattern of snow which altered day by day. In the far distance the<br>monstrous peaks of the Pyrenees, where the snow never melts, seemed to float<br>upon nothing. Even down in the plain everything looked dead and bare. The hills<br>opposite us were grey and wrinkled like the skins of elephants. Almost always<br>the sky was empty of birds. I do not think I have ever seen a country where<br>there were so few birds. The only birds one saw at any time were a kind of<br>magpie, and the coveys of partridges that startled one at night with their<br>sudden whirring, and, very rarely, the flights of eagles that drifted slowly<br>over, generally followed by rifle-shots which they did not deign to notice.<br><br>At night and in misty weather, patrols were sent out in the valley between<br>ourselves and the Fascists. The job was not popular, it was too cold and too<br>easy to get lost, and I soon found that I could get leave to go out on patrol as<br>often as I wished. In the huge jagged ravines there were no paths or tracks of<br>any kind; you could only find your way about by making successive journeys and<br>noting fresh landmarks each time. As the bullet flies the nearest Fascist post<br>was seven hundred metres from our own, but it was a mile and a half by the only<br>practicable route. It was rather fun wandering about the dark valleys with the<br>stray bullets flying high overhead like redshanks whistling. Better than<br>night-time were the heavy mists, which often lasted all day and which had a<br>habit of clinging round the hill-tops and leaving the valleys clear. When you<br>were anywhere near the Fascist lines you had to creep at a snail's pace; it was<br>very difficult to move quietly on those hill-sides, among the crackling shrubs<br>and tinkling limestones. It was only at the third or fourth attempt that I<br>managed to find my way to the Fascist lines. The mist was very thick, and I<br>crept up to the barbed wire to listen. I could hear the Fascists talking and<br>singing inside. Then to my alarm I heard several of them coming down the hill<br>towards me. I cowered behind a bush that suddenly seemed very small, and tried<br>to cock my rifle without noise. However, they branched off and did not come<br>within sight of me. Behind the bush where I was hiding I came upon various<br>relics of the earlier fighting--a pile of empty cartridge-cases, a leather cap<br>with a bullet-hole in it, and a red flag, obviously one-of our own. I took it<br>back to the position, where it was unsentimentally torn up for<br>cleaning-rags.<br><br>I had been made a corporal, or cabo, as it was called, as soon as we reached<br>the front, and was in command of a guard of twelve men. It was no sinecure,<br>especially at first. The centuria was an untrained mob composed mostly of boys<br>in their teens. Here and there in the militia you came across children as young<br>as eleven or twelve, usually refugees from Fascist territory who had been<br>enlisted as militiamen as the easiest way of providing for them. As a rule they<br>were employed on light work in the rear, but sometimes they managed to worm<br>their way to the front line, where they were a public menace. I remember one<br>little brute throwing a hand-grenade into the dug-out fire 'for a joke'. At<br>Monte Pocero I do not think there was anyone younger than fifteen, but the<br>average age must have been well under twenty. Boys of this age ought never to be<br>used in the front line, because they cannot stand the lack of sleep which is<br>inseparable from trench warfare. At the beginning it was almost impossible to<br>keep our position properly guarded at night. The wretched children of my section<br>could only be roused by dragging them out of their dug-outs feet foremost, and<br>as soon as your back was turned they left their posts and slipped into shelter;<br>or they would even, in spite of the frightful cold, lean up against the wall of<br>the trench and fall fast asleep. Luckily the enemy were very unenterprising.<br>There were nights when it seemed to me that our position could be stormed by<br>twenty Boy Scouts armed with airguns, or twenty Girl Guides armed with<br>battledores, for that matter.<br><br>At this time and until much later the Catalan militias were still on the same<br>basis as they had been at the beginning of the war. In the early days of<br>Franco's revolt the militias had been hurriedly raised by the various trade<br>unions and political parties; each was essentially a political organization,<br>owing allegiance to its party as much as to the central Government. When the<br>Popular Army, which was a 'non-political' army organized on more or less<br>ordinary lines, was raised at the beginning of 1937, the party militias were<br>theoretically incorporated in it. But for a long time the only changes that<br>occurred were on paper; the new Popular Army troops did not reach the Aragon<br>front in any numbers till June, and until that time the militia-system remained<br>unchanged. The essential point of the system was social equality between<br>officers and men. Everyone from general to private drew the same pay, ate the<br>same food, wore the same clothes, and mingled on terms of complete equality. If<br>you wanted to slap the general commanding the division on the back and ask him<br>for a cigarette, you could do so, and no one thought it curious. In theory at<br>any rate each militia was a democracy and not a hierarchy. It was understood<br>that orders had to be obeyed, but it was also understood that when you gave an<br>order you gave it as comrade to comrade and not as superior to inferior. There<br>were officers and N.C.O.S. but there was no military rank in the ordinary sense;<br>no titles, no badges, no heel-clicking and saluting. They had attempted to<br>produce within the militias a sort of temporary working model of the classless<br>society. Of course there was no perfect equality, but there was a nearer<br>approach to it than I had ever seen or than I would have thought conceivable in<br>time of war.<br><br>But I admit that at first sight the state of affairs at the front horrified<br>me. How on earth could the war be won by an army of this type? It was what<br>everyone was saying at the time, and though it was true it was also<br>unreasonable. For in the circumstances the militias could not have been much<br>better than they were. A modern mechanized army does not spring up out of the<br>ground, and if the Government had waited until it had trained troops at its<br>disposal, Franco would never have been resisted. Later it became the fashion to<br>decry the militias, and therefore to pretend that the faults which were due to<br>lack of training and weapons were the result of the equalitarian system.<br>Actually, a newly raised draft 'of militia was an undisciplined mob not because<br>the officers called the private 'Comrade' but because raw troops are always an<br>undisciplined mob. In practice the democratic 'revolutionary' type of discipline<br>is more reliable than might be expected. In a workers' army discipline is<br>theoretically voluntary. It is based on class-loyalty, whereas the discipline of<br>a bourgeois conscript army is based ultimately on fear. (The Popular Army that<br>replaced the militias was midway between the two types.) In the militias the<br>bullying and abuse that go on in an ordinary army would never have been<br>tolerated for a moment. The normal military punishments existed, but they were<br>only invoked for very serious offences. When a man refused to obey an order you<br>did not immediately get him punished; you first appealed to him in the name of<br>comradeship. Cynical people with no experience of handling men will say<br>instantly that this would never 'work', but as a matter of fact it does 'work'<br>in the long run. The discipline of even the worst drafts of militia visibly<br>improved as time went on. In January the job of keeping a dozen raw recruits up<br>to the mark almost turned my hair grey. In May for a short while I was<br>acting-lieutenant in command of about thirty men, English and Spanish. We had<br>all been under fire for months, and I never had the slightest difficulty in<br>getting an order obeyed or in getting men to volunteer for a dangerous job.<br>'Revolutionary' discipline depends on political consciousness--on an<br>understanding of why orders must be obeyed; it takes time to diffuse this, but<br>it also takes time to drill a man into an automaton on the barrack-square. The<br>journalists who sneered at the militia-system seldom remembered that the<br>militias had to hold the line while the Popular Army was training in the rear.<br>And it is a tribute to the strength of 'revolutionary' discipline that the<br>militias stayed in the field-at all. For until about June 1937 there was nothing<br>to keep them there, except class loyalty. Individual deserters could be shot--<br>were shot, occasionally--but if a thousand men had decided to walk out of the<br>line together there was no force to stop them. A conscript army in the same<br>circumstances--with its battle-police removed--would have melted away. Yet the<br>militias held the line, though God knows they won very few victories, and even<br>individual desertions were not common. In four or five months in the P.O.U.M.<br>militia I only heard of four men deserting, and two of those were fairly<br>certainly spies who had enlisted to obtain information. At the beginning the<br>apparent chaos, the general lack of training, the fact that you often had to<br>argue for five minutes before you could get an order obeyed, appalled and<br>infuriated me. I had British Army ideas, and certainly the Spanish militias were<br>very unlike the British Army. But considering the circumstances they were better<br>troops than one had any right to expect.<br><br>Meanwhile, firewood--always firewood. Throughout that period there is<br>probably no entry in my diary that does not mention firewood, or rather the lack<br>of it. We were between two and three thousand feet above sea-level, it was mid<br>winter and the cold was unspeakable. The temperature was not exceptionally low,<br>on many nights it did not even freeze, and the wintry sun often shone for an<br>hour in the middle of the day; but even if it was not really cold, I assure you<br>that it seemed so. Sometimes there were shrieking winds that tore your cap off<br>and twisted your hair in all directions, sometimes there were mists that poured<br>into the trench like a liquid and seemed to penetrate your bones; frequently it<br>rained, and even a quarter of an hour's rain was enough to make conditions<br>intolerable. The thin skin of earth over the limestone turned promptly into a<br>slippery grease, and as you were always walking on a slope it was impossible to<br>keep your footing. On dark nights I have often fallen half a dozen times in<br>twenty yards; and this was dangerous, because it meant that the lock of one's<br>rifle became jammed with mud. For days together clothes, boots, blankets, and<br>rifles were more or less coated with mud. I had brought as many thick clothes as<br>I could carry, but many of the men were terribly underclad. For the whole<br>garrison, about a hundred men, there were only twelve great-coats, which had to<br>be handed from sentry to sentry, and most of the men had only one blanket. One<br>icy night I made a list in my diary of the clothes I was wearing. It is of some<br>interest as showing the amount of clothes the human body can carry. I was<br>wearing a thick vest and pants, a flannel shirt, two pull-overs, a woollen<br>jacket, a pigskin jacket, corduroy breeches, puttees, thick socks, boots, a<br>stout trench-coat, a muffler, lined leather gloves, and a woollen cap.<br>Nevertheless I was shivering like a jelly. But I admit I am unusually sensitive<br>to cold.<br><br>Firewood was the one thing that really mattered. The point about the firewood<br>was that there was practically no firewood to be had. Our miserable mountain had<br>not even at its best much vegetation, and for months it had been ranged over by<br>freezing militiamen, with the result that everything thicker than one's finger<br>had long since been burnt. When we were not eating, sleeping, on guard, or on<br>fatigue-duty we were in the valley behind the position, scrounging for fuel. All<br>my memories of that time are memories of scrambling up and down the almost<br>perpendicular slopes, over the jagged limestone that knocked one's boots to<br>pieces, pouncing eagerly on tiny twigs of wood. Three people searching for a<br>couple of hours could collect enough fuel to keep the dug-out fire alight for<br>about an hour. The eagerness of our search for firewood turned us all into<br>botanists. We classified according to their burning qualities every plant that<br>grew on the mountain-side; the various heaths and grasses that were good to<br>start a fire with but burnt out in a few minutes, the wild rosemary and the tiny<br>whin bushes that would burn when the fire was well alight, the stunted oak tree,<br>smaller than a gooseberry bush, that was practically unburnable. There was a<br>kind of dried-up reed that was very good for starting fires with, but these grew<br>only on the hill-top to the left of the position, and you had to go under fire<br>to get them. If the Fascist machine-gunners saw you they gave you a drum of<br>ammunition all to yourself. Generally their aim was high and the bullets sang<br>overhead like birds, but sometime they crackled and chipped the limestone<br>uncomfortably close, whereupon you flung yourself on your face. You went on<br>gathering reeds, however; nothing mattered in comparison with firewood.<br><br>Beside the cold the other discomforts seemed petty. Of course all of us were<br>permanently dirty. Our water, like our food, came on mule-back from Alcubierre,<br>and each man's share worked out at about a quart a day. It was beastly water,<br>hardly more transparent than milk. Theoretically it was for drinking only, but I<br>always stole a pannikinful for washing in the mornings. I used to wash one day<br>and shave the next; there was never enough water for both. The position stank<br>abominably, and outside the little enclosure of the barricade there was<br>excrement everywhere. Some of the militiamen habitually defecated in the trench,<br>a disgusting thing when one had to walk round it in the darkness. But the dirt<br>never worried me. Dirt is a thing people make too much fuss about. It is<br>astonishing how quickly you get used to doing without a handkerchief and to<br>eating out of the tin pannikin in which you also wash. Nor was sleeping in one's<br>clothes any hardship after a day or two. It was of course impossible to take<br>one's clothes and especially one's boots off at night; one had to be ready to<br>turn out instantly in case of an attack. In eighty nights I only took my clothes<br>off three times, though I did occasionally manage to get them off in the<br>daytime. It was too cold for lice as yet, but rats and mice abounded. It is<br>often said that you don't find rats and mice in the same place, but you do when<br>there is enough food for them.<br><br>In other ways we were not badly off. The food was good enough and there was<br>plenty of wine. Cigarettes were still being issued at the rate of a packet a<br>day, matches were issued every other day, and there was even an issue of<br>candles. They were very thin candles, like those on a Christmas cake, and were<br>popularly supposed to have been looted from churches. Every dug-out was issued<br>daily with three inches of candle, which would bum for about twenty minutes. At<br>that time it was still possible to buy candles, and I had brought several pounds<br>of them with me. Later on the famine of matches and candles made life a misery.<br>You do not realize the importance of these things until you lack them. In a<br>night-alarm, for instance, when everyone in the dug--out is scrambling for his<br>rifle and treading on everybody else's face, being able to strike a light may<br>make the difference between life and death. Every militiaman possessed a<br>tinder-lighter and several yards of yellow wick. Next to his rifle it was his<br>most important possession. The tinder-lighters had the great advantage that they<br>could be struck in a wind, but they would only smoulder, so that they were no<br>use for lighting a fire. When the match famine was at its worst our only way of<br>producing a flame was to pull the bullet out of a cartridge and touch the<br>cordite off with a tinder-lighter.<br><br>It was an extraordinary life that we were living--an extraordinary way to be<br>at war, if you could call it war. The whole militia chafed against the inaction<br>and clamoured constantly to know why we were not allowed to attack. But it was<br>perfectly obvious that there would be no battle for a long while yet, unless the<br>enemy started it. Georges Kopp, on his periodical tours of inspection, was quite<br>frank with us. 'This is not a war,' he used to say, 'it is a comic opera with an<br>occasional death.' As a matter of fact the stagnation on the Aragon front had<br>political causes of which I knew nothing at that time; but the purely military<br>difficulties--quite apart from the lack of reserves of men--were obvious to<br>anybody.<br><br>To begin with, there was the nature of the country. The front line, ours and<br>the Fascists', lay in positions of immense natural strength, which as a rule<br>could only be approached from one side. Provided a few trenches have been dug,<br>such places cannot be taken by infantry, except in overwhelming numbers. In our<br>own position or most of those round us a dozen men with two machine-guns could<br>have held off a battalion. Perched on the hill-tops as we were, we should have<br>made lovely marks for artillery; but there was no artillery. Sometimes I used to<br>gaze round the landscape and long--oh, how passionately!--for a couple of<br>batteries of guns. One could have destroyed the enemy positions one after<br>another as easily as smashing nuts with a hammer. But on our side the guns<br>simply did not exist. The Fascists did occasionally manage to bring a gun or two<br>from Zaragoza and fire a very few shells, so few that they never even found the<br>range and the shells plunged harmlessly into the empty ravines. Against<br>machine-guns and without artillery there are only three things you can do: dig<br>yourself in at a safe distance--four hundred yards, say--advance across the<br>open and be massacred, or make small-scale night-attacks that will not alter the<br>general situation. Practically the alternatives are stagnation or suicide.<br><br>And beyond this there was the complete lack of war materials of every<br>description. It needs an effort to realize how badly the militias were armed at<br>this time. Any public school O.T.C. in England is far more like a modern army<br>than we were. The badness of our weapons was so astonishing that it is worth<br>recording in detail.<br><br>For this sector of the front the entire artillery consisted of four<br>trench-mortars with fifteen rounds for each gun. Of course they were far too<br>precious to be fired and the mortars were kept in Alcubierre. There were<br>machine-guns at the rate of approximately one to fifty men; they were oldish<br>guns, but fairly accurate up to three or four hundred yards. Beyond this we had<br>only rifles, and the majority of the rifles were scrap-iron. There were three<br>types of rifle in use. The first was the long Mauser. These were seldom less<br>than twenty years old, their sights were about as much use as a broken<br>speedometer, and in most of them the rifling was hopelessly corroded; about one<br>rifle in ten was not bad, however. Then there was the short Mauser, or<br>mousqueton, really a cavalry weapon. These were more popular than the others<br>because they were lighter to carry and less nuisance in a trench, also because<br>they were comparatively new and looked efficient. Actually they were almost<br>useless. They were made out of reassembled parts, no bolt belonged to its rifle,<br>and three-quarters of them could be counted on to jam after five shots. There<br>were also a few Winchester rifles. These were nice to shoot with, but they were<br>wildly inaccurate, and as their cartridges had no clips they could only be fired<br>one shot at a time. Ammunition was so scarce that each man entering the line was<br>only issued with fifty rounds, and most of it was exceedingly bad. The<br>Spanish-made cartridges were all refills and would jam even the best rifles. The<br>Mexican cartridges were better and were therefore reserved for the machine-guns.<br>Best of all was the German-made ammunition, but as this came only from prisoners<br>and deserters there was not much of it. I always kept a clip of German or<br>Mexican ammunition in my pocket for use in an emergency. But in practice when<br>the emergency came I seldom fired my rifle; I was too frightened of the beastly<br>thing jamming and too anxious to reserve at any rate one round that would go<br>off.<br><br>We had no tin hats, no bayonets, hardly any revolvers or pistols, and not<br>more than one bomb between five or ten men. The bomb in use at this time was a<br>frightful object known as the 'F.A.I. bomb', it having been produced by the<br>Anarchists in the early days of the war. It was on the principle of a Mills<br>bomb, but the lever was held down not by a pin but a piece of tape. You broke<br>the tape and then got rid of the bomb with the utmost possible speed. It was<br>said of these bombs that they were 'impartial'; they killed the man they were<br>thrown at and the man who threw them. There were several other types, even more<br>primitive but probably a little less dangerous--to the thrower, I mean. It was<br>not till late March that I saw a bomb worth throwing.<br><br>And apart from weapons there was a shortage of all the minor necessities of<br>war. We had no maps or charts, for instance. Spain has never been fully<br>surveyed, and the only detailed maps of this area were the old military ones,<br>which were almost all in the possession of the Fascists. We had no<br>range-finders, no telescopes, no periscopes, no field-glasses except for a few<br>privately-owned pairs, no flares or Very lights, no wire-cutters, no armourers'<br>tools, hardly even any cleaning materials. The Spaniards seemed never to have<br>heard of a pull-through and looked on in surprise when I constructed one. When<br>you wanted your rifle cleaned you took it to the sergeant, who possessed a long<br>brass ramrod which was invariably bent and therefore scratched the rifling.<br>There was not even any gun oil. You greased your rifle with olive oil, when you<br>could get hold of it; at different times I have greased mine with vaseline, with<br>cold cream, and even with bacon-fat. Moreover, there were no lanterns or<br>electric torches--at this time there was not, I believe, such a thing as an<br>electric torch throughout the whole of our sector of the front, and you could<br>not buy one nearer than Barcelona, and only with difficulty even there.<br><br>As time went on, and the desultory rifle-fire rattled among the hills, I<br>began to wonder with increasing scepticism whether anything would ever happen to<br>bring a bit of life, or rather a bit of death, into this cock-eyed war. It was<br>pneumonia that we were fighting against, not against men. When the trenches are<br>more than five hundred yards apart no one gets hit except by accident. Of course<br>there were casualties, but the majority of them were self-inflicted. If I<br>remember rightly, the first five men I saw wounded in Spain were all wounded by<br>our own weapons--I don't mean intentionally, but owing to accident or<br>carelessness. Our worn-out rifles were a danger in themselves. Some of them had<br>a nasty trick of going off if the butt was tapped on the ground; I saw a man<br>shoot himself through the hand owing to this. And in the darkness the raw<br>recruits were always firing at one another. One evening when it was barely even<br>dusk a sentry let fly at me from a distance of twenty yards; but he missed me by<br>a yard--goodness knows how many times the Spanish standard of marksmanship has<br>saved my life. Another time I had gone out on patrol in the mist and had<br>carefully warned the guard commander beforehand. But in coming back I stumbled<br>against a bush, the startled sentry called out that the Fascists were coming,<br>and I had the pleasure of hearing the guard commander order everyone to open<br>rapid fire in my direction. Of course I lay down and the bullets went harmlessly<br>over me. Nothing will convince a Spaniard, at least a young Spaniard, that<br>fire-arms are dangerous. Once, rather later than this, I was photographing some<br>machine-gunners with their gun, which was pointed directly towards me.<br><br>'Don't fire,' I said half-jokingly as I focused the camera.<br><br>'Oh no, we won't fire.'<br><br>The next moment there was a frightful roar and a stream of bullets tore past<br>my face so close that my cheek was stung by grains of cordite. It was<br>unintentional, but the machine-gunners considered it a great joke. Yet only a<br>few days earlier they had seen a mule-driver accidentally shot by a political<br>delegate who was playing the fool with an automatic pistol and had put five<br>bullets in the mule-driver's lungs.<br><br>The difficult passwords which the army was using at this time were a minor<br>source of danger. They were those tiresome double passwords in which one word<br>has to be answered by another. Usually they were of an elevating and<br>revolutionary nature, such as Cultura--progreso, or Seremos--invencibles, and<br>it was often impossible to get illiterate sentries to remember these<br>highfalutin' words. One night, I remember, the password was Cataluna--eroica,<br>and a moonfaced peasant lad named Jaime Domenech approached me, greatly puzzled,<br>and asked me to explain.<br><br>'Eroica--what does eroica mean?'<br><br>I told him that it meant the same as valiente. A little while later he was<br>stumbling up the trench in the darkness, and the sentry challenged him:<br><br>'Alto! Cataluna!'<br><br>'Valiente!' yelled Jaime, certain that he was saying the right thing.<br><br>Bang!<br><br>However, the sentry missed him. In this war everyone always did miss everyone<br>else, when it was humanly possible.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/1.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/3.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
