<h2>Chapter 8</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>THE days grew hotter and even the nights grew tolerably warm. On a bullet--<br>chipped tree in front of our parapet thick clusters of cherries were forming.<br>Bathing in the river ceased to be an agony and became almost a pleasure. Wild<br>roses with pink blooms the size of saucers straggled over the shell-holes round<br>Torre Fabian. Behind the line you met peasants wearing wild roses over their<br>ears. In the evenings they used to go out with green nets, hunting quails. You<br>spread the net over the tops of the grasses and then lay down and made a noise<br>like a female quail. Any male quail that was within hearing then came running<br>towards you, and when he was underneath the net you threw a stone to scare him,<br>whereupon he sprang into the air and was entangled in the net. Apparently only<br>male quails were caught, which struck me as unfair.<br><br>There was a section of Andalusians next to us in the line now. I do not know<br>quite how they got to this front. The current explanation was that they had run<br>away from Malaga so fast that they had forgotten to stop at Valencia; but this,<br>of course, came from the Catalans, who professed to look down on the Andalusians<br>as a race of semi-savages. Certainly the Andalusians were very ignorant. Few if<br>any of them could read, and they seemed not even to know the one thing that<br>everybody knows in Spain--which political party they belonged to. They thought<br>they were Anarchists, but were not quite certain; perhaps they were Communists.<br>They were gnarled, rustic-looking men, shepherds or labourers from the olive<br>groves, perhaps, with faces deeply stained by the ferocious suns of farther<br>south. They were very useful to us, for they had an extraordinary dexterity at<br>rolling the dried-up Spanish tobacco into cigarettes. The issue of cigarettes<br>had ceased, but in Monflorite it was occasionally possible to buy packets of the<br>cheapest kind of tobacco, which in appearance and texture was very like chopped<br>chaff. Its flavour was not bad, but it was so dry that even when you had<br>succeeded in making a cigarette the tobacco promptly fell out and left an empty<br>cylinder. The Andalusians, however, could roll admirable cigarettes and had a<br>special technique for tucking the ends in.<br><br>Two Englishmen were laid low by sunstroke. My salient memories of that time<br>are the heat of the midday sun, and working half-naked with sand--bags punishing<br>one's shoulders which were already flayed by the sun; and the lousiness of our<br>clothes and boots, which were literally dropping to pieces; and the struggles<br>with the mule which brought our rations and which did not mind rifle-fire but<br>took to flight when shrapnel burst in the air; and the mosquitoes (just<br>beginning to be active) and the rats, which were a public nuisance and would<br>even devour leather belts and cartridge-pouches. Nothing was happening except an<br>occasional casualty from a sniper's bullet and the sporadic artillery-fire and<br>air-raids on Huesca. Now that the trees were in full leaf we had constructed<br>snipers' platforms, like machans, in the poplar trees that fringed the line. On<br>the other side of Huesca the attacks were petering out. The Anarchists had had<br>heavy losses and had not succeeded in completely cutting the Jaca road. They had<br>managed to establish themselves close enough on either side to bring the road<br>itself under machine-gun fire and make it impassable for traffic; but the gap<br>was a kilometre wide and the Fascists had constructed a sunken road, a sort of<br>enormous trench, along which a certain number of lorries could come and go.<br>Deserters reported that in Huesca there were plenty of munitions and very little<br>food. But the town was evidently not going to fall. Probably it would have been<br>impossible to take it with the fifteen thousand ill-armed men who were<br>available. Later, in June, the Government brought troops from the Madrid front<br>and concentrated thirty thousand men on Huesca, with an enormous quantity of<br>aeroplanes, but still the town did not fall.<br><br>When we went on leave I had been a hundred and fifteen days in the line, and<br>at the time this period seemed to me to have been one of the most futile of my<br>whole life. I had joined the militia in order to fight against Fascism, and as<br>yet I had scarcely fought at all, had merely existed as a sort of passive<br>object, doing nothing in return for my rations except to suffer from cold and<br>lack of sleep. Perhaps that is the fate of most soldiers in most wars. But now<br>that I can see this period in perspective I do not altogether regret it. I wish,<br>indeed, that I could have served the Spanish Government a little more<br>effectively; but from a personal point of view--from the point of view of my<br>own development--those first three or four months that I spent in the line were<br>less futile than I then thought. They formed a kind of interregnum in my life,<br>quite different from anything that had gone before and perhaps from anything<br>that is to come, and they taught me things that I could not have learned in any<br>other way.<br><br>The essential point is that all this time I had been isolated--for at the<br>front one was almost completely isolated from the outside world: even of what<br>was happening in Barcelona one had only a dim conception--among people who<br>could roughly but not too inaccurately be described as revolutionaries. This was<br>the result of the militia--system, which on the Aragon front was not radically<br>altered till about June 1937. The workers' militias, based on the trade unions<br>and each composed of people of approximately the same political opinions, had<br>the effect of canalizing into one place all the most revolutionary sentiment in<br>the country. I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any<br>size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism<br>were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragon one was among tens of<br>thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all<br>living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was<br>perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense<br>in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of<br>Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of<br>Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life--snobbishness,<br>money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.--had simply ceased to exist. The<br>ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost<br>unthinkable in the money--tainted air of England; there was no one there except<br>the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master. Of<br>course such a state of affairs could not last. It was simply a temporary and<br>local phase in an enormous game that is being played over the whole surface of<br>the earth. But it lasted long enough to have its effect upon anyone who<br>experienced it. However much one cursed at the time, one realized afterwards<br>that one had been in contact with something strange and valuable. One had been<br>in a community where hope was more normal than apathy or cynicism, where the<br>word 'comrade' stood for comradeship and not, as in most countries, for humbug.<br>One had breathed the air of equality. I am well aware that it is now the fashion<br>to deny that Socialism has anything to do with equality. In every country in the<br>world a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy 'proving'<br>that Socialism means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the<br>grab-motive left intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism<br>quite different from this. The thing that attracts ordinary men to Socialism and<br>makes them willing to risk their skins for it, the 'mystique' of Socialism, is<br>the idea of equality; to the vast majority of people Socialism means a classless<br>society, or it means nothing at all. And it was here that those few months in<br>the militia were valuable to me. For the Spanish militias, while they lasted,<br>were a sort of microcosm of a classless society. In that community where no one<br>was on the make, where there was a shortage of everything but no privilege and<br>no boot-licking, one got, perhaps, a crude forecast of what the opening stages<br>of Socialism might be like. And, after all, instead of disillusioning me it<br>deeply attracted me. The effect was to make my desire to see Socialism<br>established much more actual than it had been before. Partly, perhaps, this was<br>due to the good luck of being among Spaniards, who, with their innate decency<br>and their ever-present Anarchist tinge, would make even the opening stages of<br>Socialism tolerable if they had the chance.<br><br>Of course at the time I was hardly conscious of the changes that were<br>occurring in my own mind. Like everyone about me I was chiefly conscious of<br>boredom, heat, cold, dirt, lice, privation, and occasional danger. It is quite<br>different now. This period which then seemed so futile and eventless is now of<br>great importance to me. It is so different from the rest of my life that already<br>it has taken on the magic quality which, as a rule, belongs only to memories<br>that are years old. It was beastly while it was happening, but it is a good<br>patch for my mind to browse upon. I wish I could convey to you the atmosphere of<br>that time. I hope I have done so, a little, in the earlier chapters of this<br>book. It is all bound up in my mind with the winter cold, the ragged uniforms of<br>militiamen, the oval Spanish faces, the morse-like tapping of machine-guns, the<br>smells of urine and rotting bread, the tinny taste of bean-stews wolfed<br>hurriedly out of unclean pannikins.<br><br>The whole period stays by me with curious vividness. In my memory I live over<br>incidents that might seem too petty to be worth recalling. I am in the dug-out<br>at Monte Pocero again, on the ledge of limestone that serves as a bed, and young<br>Ramon is snoring with his nose flattened between my shoulder-blades. I am<br>stumbling up the mucky trench, through the mist that swirls round me like cold<br>steam. I am half-way up a crack in the mountain-side, struggling to keep my<br>balance and to tug a root of wild rosemary out of the ground. High overhead some<br>meaningless bullets are singing.<br><br>I am lying hidden among small fir-trees on the low ground west of Monte<br>Oscuro, with Kopp and Bob Edwards and three Spaniards. Up the naked grey hill to<br>the right of us a string of Fascists are climbing like ants. Close in front a<br>bugle-call rings out from the Fascist lines. Kopp catches my eye and, with a<br>schoolboy gesture, thumbs his nose at the sound.<br><br>I am in the mucky yard at La Granja, among the mob of men who are struggling<br>with their tin pannikins round the cauldron of stew. The fat and harassed cook<br>is warding them off with the ladle. At a table nearby a bearded man with a huge<br>automatic pistol strapped to his belt is hewing loaves of bread into five<br>pieces. Behind me a Cockney voice (Bill Chambers, with whom I quarrelled<br>bitterly and who was afterwards killed outside Huesca) is singing:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rats, rats,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rats as big as cats,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the. . .<br><br>A shell comes screaming over. Children of fifteen fling themselves on their<br>faces. The cook dodges behind the cauldron. Everyone rises with a sheepish<br>expression as the shell plunges and booms a hundred yards away.<br><br>I am walking up and down the line of sentries, under the dark boughs of the<br>poplars. In the flooded ditch outside the rats are paddling about, making as<br>much noise as otters. As the yellow dawn comes up behind us, the Andalusian<br>sentry, muffled in his cloak, begins singing. Across no man's land, a hundred or<br>two hundred yards away, you can hear the Fascist sentry also singing.<br><br>On 25 April, after the usual mananas, another section relieved us and we<br>handed over our rifles, packed our kits, and marched back to Monflorite. I was<br>not sorry to leave the line. The lice were multiplying in my trousers far faster<br>than I could massacre them, and for a month past I had had no socks and my boots<br>had very little sole left, so that I was walking more or less barefoot. I wanted<br>a hot bath, clean clothes, and a night between sheets more passionately than it<br>is possible to want anything when one has been living a normal civilized life.<br>We slept a few hours in a barn in Monflorite, jumped a lorry in the small hours,<br>caught the five o'clock train at Barbastro, and--having the luck to connect<br>with a fast train at Lerida--were in Barcelona by three o'clock in the<br>afternoon of the 26th. And after that the trouble began.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/6.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/8.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
