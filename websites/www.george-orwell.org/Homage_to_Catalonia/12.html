<h2>Chapter 13</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>IN Barcelona, during all those last weeks I spent there, there was a peculiar<br>evil feeling in the air--an atmosphere of suspicion, fear, uncertainty, and<br>veiled hatred. The May fighting had left ineradicable after-effects behind it.<br>With the fall of the Caballero Government the Communists had come definitely<br>into power, the charge of internal order had been handed over to Communist<br>ministers, and no one doubted that they would smash their political rivals as<br>soon as they got a quarter of a chance Nothing was happening as yet, I myself<br>had not even any mental picture of what was going to happen; and yet there was a<br>perpetual vague sense of danger, a consciousness of some evil thing that was<br>impending. However little you were actually conspiring, the atmosphere forced<br>you to feel like a conspirator. You seemed to spend all your time holding<br>whispered conversations in corners of cafes and wondering whether that person at<br>the next table was a police spy.<br><br>Sinister rumours of all kinds were flying round, thanks to the Press<br>censorship. One was that the Negrin-Prieto Government was planning to compromise<br>the war. At the time I was inclined to believe this, for the Fascists were<br>closing in on Bilbao and the Government was visibly doing nothing to save it.<br>Basque flags were displayed all over the town, girls rattled collecting-boxes in<br>the cafes, and there were the usual broadcasts about 'heroic defenders', but the<br>Basques were getting no real assistance. It was tempting to believe that the<br>Government was playing a double game. Later events have proved, that I was quite<br>wrong here, but it seems probable that Bilbao could have been saved if a little<br>more energy had been shown. An offensive on the Aragon front, even an<br>unsuccessful one, would have forced Franco to divert part of his army; as it was<br>the Government did not begin any offensive action till it was far too late--<br>indeed, till about the time when Bilbao fell. The C.N.T. was distributing in<br>huge numbers a leaflet saying: 'Be on your guard!' and hinting that 'a certain<br>Party' (meaning the Communists) was plotting a coup d'etat. There was also a<br>widespread fear that Catalonia was going to be invaded. Earlier, when we went<br>back to the front, I had seen the powerful defences that were being constructed<br>scores of miles behind the front line, and fresh bomb-proof shelters were being<br>dug all over Barcelona. There were frequent scares of air-raids and sea-raids;<br>more often than not these were false alarms, but every time the sirens blew the<br>lights all over the town blacked out for hours on end and timid people dived for<br>the cellars. Police spies were everywhere. The jails were still crammed with<br>prisoners left over from the May fighting, and others--always, of course.<br>Anarchist and P.O.U.M. adherents--were disappearing into jail by ones and twos.<br>So far as one could discover, no one was ever tried or even charged--not even<br>charged with anything so definite as 'Trotskyism'; you were simply flung into<br>jail and kept there, usually incommunicado. Bob Smillie was still in jail in<br>Valencia. We could discover nothing except that neither the I.L.P.<br>representative on the spot nor the lawyer who had been engaged, was permitted to<br>see him. Foreigners from the International Column and other militias were<br>getting into jail in larger and larger numbers. Usually they were arrested as<br>deserters. It was typical of the general situation that nobody now knew for<br>certain whether a militiaman was a volunteer or a regular soldier. A few months<br>earlier anyone enlisting in the militia had been told that he was a volunteer<br>and could, if he wished, get his discharge papers at any time when he was due<br>for leave. Now it appeared that the Government had changed its mind, a<br>militiaman was a regular soldier and counted as a deserter if he tried to go<br>home. But even about this no one seemed certain. At some parts of the front the<br>authorities were still issuing discharges. At the frontier these were sometimes<br>recognized, sometimes not; if not, you were promptly thrown into jail. Later the<br>number of foreign 'deserters' in jail swelled into hundreds, but most of them<br>were repatriated when a fuss was made in their own countries.<br><br>Bands of armed Assault Guards roamed everywhere in the streets, the Civil<br>Guards were still holding cafes and other buildings in strategic spots, and many<br>of the P.S.U.C. buildings were still sandbagged and barricaded. At various<br>points in the town there were posts manned by Civil Guards of Carabineros who<br>stopped passers-by and demanded their papers. Everyone warned me not to show my<br>P.O.U.M. militiaman's card but merely to show my passport and my hospital<br>ticket. Even to be known to have served in the P.O.U.M. militia was vaguely<br>dangerous. P.O.U.M. militiamen who were wounded or on leave were penalized in<br>petty ways--it was made difficult for them to draw their pay, for instance. La<br>Batalla was still appearing, but it was censored almost out of existence, and<br>Solidaridad and the other Anarchist papers were also heavily censored. There was<br>a new rule that censored portions of a newspaper must not be left blank but<br>filled up with other matter; as a result it was often impossible to tell when<br>something had been cut out.<br><br>The food shortage, which had fluctuated throughout the War, was in one of its<br>bad stages. Bread was scarce and the cheaper sorts were being adulterated with<br>rice; the bread the soldiers were getting in the barracks was dreadful stuff<br>like putty. Milk and sugar were very scarce and tobacco almost non-existent,<br>except for the expensive smuggled cigarettes. There was an acute shortage of<br>olive oil, which Spaniards use for half a dozen different purposes. The queues<br>of women waiting to buy olive oil were controlled by mounted Civil Guards who<br>sometimes amused themselves by backing their horses into the queue and trying to<br>make them tread on the women's toes. A minor annoyance of the time was the lack<br>of small change. The silver had been withdrawn and as yet no new coinage had<br>been issued, so that there was nothing between the ten-centime piece and the<br>note for two and a half pesetas, and all notes below ten pesetas were very<br>scarce. [Note 13, below] For the poorest people this meant an aggravation of<br>the food shortage. A woman with only a ten-peseta note in her possession might<br>wait for hours in a queue outside the grocery and then be unable to buy anything<br>after all because the grocer had no change and she could not afford to spend<br>the whole note.<br><br>[Note 13. The purchasing value of the peseta was about fourpence.]<br><br>It is not easy to convey the nightmare atmosphere of that time--the peculiar<br>uneasiness produced by rumours that were always changing, by censored<br>newspapers, and the constant presence of armed men. It is not easy to convey it<br>because, at the moment, the thing essential to such an atmosphere does not exist<br>in England. In England political intolerance is not yet taken for granted. There<br>is political persecution in a petty way; if I were a coal-miner I would not care<br>to be known to the boss as a Communist; but the 'good party man', the<br>gangster-gramophone of continental politics, is still a rarity, and the notion<br>of 'liquidating' or 'eliminating' everyone who happens to disagree with you does<br>not yet seem natural. It seemed only too natural in Barcelona. The 'Stalinists'<br>were in the saddle, and therefore it was a matter of course that every<br>'Trotskyist' was in danger. The thing everyone feared was a thing which, after<br>all, did not happen--a fresh outbreak of street-fighting, which, as before,<br>would be blamed on the P.O.U.M. and the Anarchists. There were times when I<br>caught my ears listening for the first shots. It was as though some huge evil<br>intelligence were brooding over the town. Everyone noticed it and remarked upon<br>it. And it was queer how everyone expressed it in almost the same words: 'The<br>atmosphere of this place--it's horrible. Like being in a lunatic asylum.' But<br>perhaps I ought not to say everyone. Some of the English visitors who flitted<br>briefly through Spain, from hotel to hotel, seem not to have noticed that there<br>was anything wrong with the general atmosphere. The Duchess of Atholl writes, I<br>notice (Sunday Express, 17 October 1937):<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Valencia, Madrid, and Barcelona . . . perfect order prevailed in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all three towns without any display of force. All the hotels in which I stayed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were not only 'normal' and 'decent', but extremely comfortable, in spite of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the shortage of butter and coffee.<br><br>It is a peculiarity of English travellers that they do not really believe in<br>the existence of anything outside the smart hotels. I hope they found some<br>butter for the Duchess of Atholl.<br><br>I was at the Sanatorium Maurin, one of the sanatoria run by the P.O.U.M. It<br>was in the suburbs near Tibidabo, the queer-shaped mountain that rises abruptly<br>behind Barcelona and is traditionally supposed to have been the hill from which<br>Satan showed Jesus the countries of the earth (hence its name). The house had<br>previously belonged to some wealthy bourgeois and had been seized at the time of<br>the revolution. Most of the men there had either been invalided out of the line<br>or had some wound that had permanently disabled them--amputated limbs, and so<br>forth. There were several other Englishmen there: Williams, with a damaged leg,<br>and Stafford Cottman, a boy of eighteen, who had been sent back from the<br>trenches with suspected tuberculosis, and Arthur Clinton, whose smashed left arm<br>was still strapped on to one of those huge wire contraptions, nicknamed<br>aeroplanes, which the Spanish hospitals were using. My wife was still staying at<br>the Hotel Continental, and I generally came into Barcelona in the daytime. In<br>the morning I used to attend the General Hospital for electrical treatment of my<br>arm. It was a queer business--a series of prickly electric shocks that made the<br>various sets of muscles jerk up and down--but it seemed to do some good; the<br>use of my fingers came back and the pain grew somewhat less. Both of us had<br>decided that the best thing we could do was to go back to England as soon as<br>possible. I was extremely weak, my voice was gone, seemingly for good, and the<br>doctors told me that at best it would be several months before I was fit to<br>fight. I had got to start earning some money sooner or later, and there did not<br>seem much sense in staying in Spain and eating food that was needed for other<br>people. But my motives were mainly selfish. I had an overwhelming desire to get<br>away from it all; away from the horrible atmosphere of political suspicion and<br>hatred, from streets thronged by armed men, from air-raids, trenches,<br>machine-guns, screaming trams, milkless tea, oil cookery, and shortage of<br>cigarettes--from almost everything that I had learnt to associate with<br>Spain.<br><br>The doctors at the General Hospital had certified me medically unfit, but to<br>get my discharge I had to see a medical board at one of the hospitals near the<br>front and then go to Sietamo to get my papers stamped at the P.O.U.M. militia<br>headquarters. Kopp had just come back from the front, full of jubilation. He had<br>just been in action and said that Huesca was going to be taken at last. The<br>Government had brought troops from the Madrid front and were concentrating<br>thirty thousand men, with aeroplanes in huge numbers. The Italians I had seen<br>going up the line from Tarragona had attacked on the Jaca road but had had heavy<br>casualties and lost two tanks. However, the town was bound to fall, Kopp said.<br>(Alas! It didn't. The attack was a frightful mess--up and led to nothing except<br>an orgy of lying in the newspapers.) Meanwhile Kopp had to go down to Valencia<br>for an interview at the Ministry of War. He had a letter from General Pozas, now<br>commanding the Army of the East--the usual letter, describing Kopp as a 'person<br>of all confidence' and recommending him for a special appointment in the<br>engineering section (Kopp had been an engineer in civil life). He left for<br>Valencia the same day as I left for Sietamo--15 June.<br><br>It was five days before I got back to Barcelona. A lorry-load of us reached<br>Sietamo about midnight, and as soon as we got to the P.O.U.M. headquarters they<br>lined us up and began handling out rifles and cartridges, before even taking our<br>names. It seemed that the attack was beginning and they were likely to call for<br>reserves at any moment. I had my hospital ticket in my pocket, but I could not<br>very well refuse to go with the others. I kipped down on the ground, with a<br>cartridge-box for a pillow, in a mood of deep dismay. Being wounded had spoiled<br>my nerve for the time being--I believe this usually happens--and the prospect<br>of being under fire frightened me horribly. However, there was a bit of manana,<br>as usual, we were not called out after all, and next morning I produced my<br>hospital ticket and went in search of my discharge. It meant a series of<br>confused, tiresome journeys. As usual they bandied one to and fro from hospital<br>to hospital--Sietamo, Barbastro, Monzon, then back to Sietamo to get my<br>discharge stamped, then down the line again via Barbastro and Lerida--and the<br>convergence of troops on Huesca had monopolized all the transport and<br>disorganized everything. I remember sleeping in queer places--once in a<br>hospital bed, but once in a ditch, once on a very narrow bench which I fell off<br>in the middle of the night, and once in a sort of municipal lodging-house in<br>Barbastro. As soon as you got away from the railroad there was no way of<br>travelling except by jumping chance lorries. You had to wait by the roadside for<br>hours, sometimes three or four hours at a stretch, with knots of disconsolate<br>peasants who carried bundles full of ducks and rabbits, waving to lorry after<br>lorry. When finally you struck a lorry that was not chock full of men, loaves of<br>bread, or ammunition-boxes the bumping over the vile roads wallowed you to pulp.<br>No horse has ever thrown me so high as those lorries used to throw me. The only<br>way of travelling was to crowd all together and cling to one another. To my<br>humiliation I found that I was still too weak to climb on to a lorry without<br>being helped.<br><br>I slept a night at Monzon Hospital, where I went to see my medical board. In<br>the next bed to me there was an Assault Guard, wounded over the left eye. He was<br>friendly and gave me cigarettes. I said: 'In Barcelona we should have been<br>shooting one another,' and we laughed over this. It was queer how the general<br>spirit seemed to change when you got anywhere near the front line. All or nearly<br>all of the vicious hatred of the political parties evaporated. During all the<br>time I was at the front I never once remember any P.S.U.C. adherent showing me<br>hostility because I was P.O.U.M. That kind of thing belonged in Barcelona or in<br>places even remoter from the war. There were a lot of Assault Guards in Sietamo.<br>They had been sent on from Barcelona to take part in the attack on Huesca. The<br>Assault Guards were a corps not intended primarily for the front, and many of<br>them had not been under fire before. Down in Barcelona they were lords of the<br>street, but up here they were quintos (rookies) and palled up with militia<br>children of fifteen who had been in the line for months.<br><br>At Monzon Hospital the doctor did the usual tongue-pulling and mirror--<br>thrusting business, assured me in the same cheerful manner as the others that I<br>should never have a voice again, and signed my certificate. While I waited to be<br>examined there was going on inside the surgery some dreadful operation without<br>anaesthetics--why without anaesthetics I do not know. It went on and on, scream<br>after scream, and when I went in there were chairs flung about and on the floor<br>were pools of blood and urine.<br><br>The details of that final journey stand out in my mind with strange clarity.<br>I was in a different mood, a more observing mood, than I had been in for months<br>past. I had got my discharge, stamped with the seal of the 29th Division, and<br>the doctor's certificate in which I was 'declared useless'. I was free to go<br>back to England; consequently I felt able, almost for the first time, to look at<br>Spain. I had a day to put in to Barbastro, for there was only one train a day.<br>Previously I had seen Barbastro in brief glimpses, and it had seemed to me<br>simply a part of the war--a grey, muddy, cold place, full of roaring lorries<br>and shabby troops. It seemed queerly different now. Wandering through it I<br>became aware of pleasant tortuous streets, old stone bridges, wine shops with<br>great oozy barrels as tall as a man, and intriguing semi-subterranean shops<br>where men were making cartwheels, daggers, wooden spoons, and goatskin<br>water-bottles. I watched a man making a skin bottle and discovered with great<br>interest, what I had never known before, that they are made with the fur inside<br>and the fur is not removed, so that you are really drinking distilled goat's<br>hair. I had drunk out of them for months without knowing this. And at the back<br>of the town there was a shallow jade-green river, and rising out of it a<br>perpendicular cliff of rock, with houses built into the rock, so that from your<br>bedroom window you could spit straight into the water a hundred feet below.<br>Innumerable doves lived in the holes in the cliff. And in Lerida there were old<br>crumbling buildings upon whose cornices thousands upon thousands of swallows had<br>built their nests, so that at a little distance the crusted pattern of nests was<br>like some florid moulding of the rococo period. It was queer how for nearly six<br>months past I had had no eyes for such things. With my discharge papers in my<br>pocket I felt like a human being again, and also a little like a tourist. For<br>almost the first time I felt that I was really in Spain, in a country that I had<br>longed all my life to visit. In the quiet back streets of Lerida and Barbastro I<br>seemed to catch a momentary glimpse, a sort of far-off rumour of the Spain that<br>dwells in everyone's imagination. White sierras, goatherds, dungeons of the<br>Inquisition, Moorish palaces, black winding trains of mules, grey olive trees<br>and groves of lemons, girls in black mantillas, the wines of Malaga and<br>Alicante, cathedrals, cardinals, bull-fights, gypsies, serenades--in short,<br>Spain. Of all Europe it was the country that had had most hold upon my<br>imagination. It seemed a pity that when at last I had managed to come here I had<br>seen only this north-eastern corner, in the middle of a confused war and for the<br>most part in winter.<br><br>It was late when I got back to Barcelona, and there were no taxis. It was no<br>use trying to get to the Sanatorium Maurin, which was right outside the town, so<br>I made for the Hotel Continental, stopping for dinner on the way. I remember the<br>conversation I had with a very fatherly waiter about the oak jugs, bound with<br>copper, in which they served the wine. I said I would like to buy a set of them<br>to take back to England. The waiter was sympathetic. 'Yes, beautiful, were they<br>not? But impossible to buy nowadays. Nobody was manufacturing them any longer--<br>nobody was manufacturing anything. This war--such a pity!' We agreed that the<br>war was a pity. Once again I felt like a tourist. The waiter asked me gently,<br>had I liked Spain; would I come back to Spain? Oh, yes, I should come back to<br>Spain. The peaceful quality of this conversation sticks in my memory, because of<br>what happened immediately afterwards.<br><br>When I got to the hotel my wife was sitting in the lounge. She got up and<br>came towards me in what struck me as a very unconcerned manner; then she put an<br>arm round my neck and, with a sweet smile for the benefit of the other people in<br>the lounge, hissed in my ear:<br><br>'Get out!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Get out of here at once!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Don't keep standing here! You must get outside quickly!'<br><br>'What? Why? What do you mean?'<br><br>She had me by the arm and was already leading me towards the stairs. Half-way<br>down we met a Frenchman--I am not going to give his name, for though he had no<br>connexion with the P.O.U.M. he was a good friend to us all during the trouble.<br>He looked at me with a concerned face.<br><br>'Listen! You mustn't come in here. Get out quickly and hide yourself before<br>they ring up the police.'<br><br>And behold! at the bottom of the stairs one of the hotel staff, who was a<br>P.O.U.M. member (unknown to the management, I fancy), slipped furtively out of<br>the lift and told me in broken English to get out. Even now I did not grasp what<br>had happened.<br><br>'What the devil is all this about?' I said, as soon as we were on the<br>pavement.<br><br>'Haven't you heard?'<br><br>'No. Heard what? I've heard nothing.'<br><br>'The P.O.U.M.'S been suppressed. They've seized all the buildings.<br>Practically everyone's in prison. And they say they're shooting people<br>already.'<br><br>So that was it. We had to have somewhere to talk. All the big cafes on the<br>Ramblas were thronged with police, but we found a quiet cafe in a side street.<br>My wife explained to me what had happened while I was away.<br><br>On 15 June the police had suddenly arrested Andres Nin in his office, and the<br>same evening had raided the Hotel Falcon and arrested all the people in it,<br>mostly militiamen on leave. The place was converted immediately into a prison,<br>and in a very little while it was filled to the brim with prisoners of all<br>kinds. Next day the P.O.U.M. was declared an illegal organization and all its<br>offices, book-stalls, sanatoria, Red Aid centres, and so forth were seized.<br>Meanwhile the police were arresting everyone they could lay hands on who was<br>known to have any connexion with the P.O.U.M. Within a day or two all or almost<br>all of the forty members of the Executive Committee were in prison. Possibly one<br>or two had escaped into hiding, but the police were adopting the trick<br>(extensively used on both sides in this war) of seizing a man's wife as a<br>hostage if he disappeared. There was no way of discovering how many people had<br>been arrested. My wife had heard that it was about four hundred in Barcelona<br>alone. I have since thought that even at that time the numbers must have been<br>greater. And the most fantastic people had been arrested. In some cases the<br>police had even gone to the length of dragging wounded militiamen out of the<br>hospitals.<br><br>It was all profoundly dismaying. What the devil was it all about? I could<br>understand their suppressing the P.O.U.M., but what were they arresting people<br>for? For nothing, so far as one could discover. Apparently the suppression of<br>the P.O.U.M. had a retrospective effect; the P.O.U.M. was now illegal, and<br>therefore one was breaking the law by having previously belonged to it. As<br>usual, none of the arrested people had been charged. Meanwhile, however, the<br>Valencia Communist papers were naming with the story of a huge 'Fascist plot',<br>radio communication with the enemy, documents signed in invisible ink, etc.,<br>etc. I have dealt with this story earlier. The significant thing was that it was<br>appearing only in the Valencia papers; I think I am right in saying that there<br>was not a single word about it, or about the suppression of the P.O.U.M., in any<br>Barcelona papers, Communist, Anarchist, or Republican. We first learned the<br>precise nature of the charges against the P.O.U.M. leaders not from any Spanish<br>paper but from the English papers that reached Barcelona a day or two later.<br>What we could not know at this time was that the Government was not responsible<br>for the charge of treachery and espionage, and that members of the Government<br>were later to repudiate it. We only vaguely knew that the P.O.U.M. leaders, and<br>presumably all the rest of us, were accused of being in Fascist pay. And already<br>the rumours were flying round that people were being secretly shot in jail.<br>There was a lot of exaggeration about this, but it certainly happened in some<br>cases, and there is not much doubt that it happened in the case of Nin. After<br>his arrest Nin was transferred to Valencia and thence to Madrid, and as early as<br>21 June the rumour reached Barcelona that he had been shot. Later the rumour<br>took a more definite shape: Nin had been shot in prison by the secret police and<br>his body dumped into the street. This story came from several sources, including<br>Federico Montsenys, an ex-member of the Government. From that day to this Nin<br>has never been heard of alive again. When, later, the Government were questioned<br>by delegates from various countries, they shilly-shallied and would say only<br>that Nin had disappeared and they knew nothing of his whereabouts. Some of the<br>newspapers produced a tale that he had escaped to Fascist territory. No evidence<br>was given in support of it, and Irujo, the Minister of Justice, later declared<br>that the Espagne news-agency had falsified his official communique. [Note 14, below]<br>In any case it is most unlikely that a political prisoner of Nin's importance<br>would be allowed to escape. Unless at some future time he is produced alive,<br>I think we must take it that he was murdered in prison.<br><br>[Note 14. See the reports of the Maxton delegation which<br>I referred to in Chapter II.]<br><br>The tale of arrests went on and on, extending over months, until the number<br>of political prisoners, not counting Fascists, swelled into thousands. One<br>noticeable thing was the autonomy of the lower ranks of the police. Many of the<br>arrests were admittedly illegal, and various people whose release had been<br>ordered by the Chief of Police were re--arrested at the jail gate and carried<br>off to 'secret prisons'. A typical case is that of Kurt Landau and his wife.<br>They were arrested about 17 June, and Landau immediately 'disappeared'. Five<br>months later his wife was still in jail, untried and without news of her<br>husband. She declared a hunger-strike, after which the Minister of Justice, sent<br>word to assure her that her husband was dead. Shortly afterwards she was<br>released, to be almost immediately re-arrested and flung into prison again. And<br>it was noticeable that the police, at any rate at first, seemed completely<br>indifferent as to any effect their actions might have upon the war. They were<br>quite ready to arrest military officers in important posts without getting<br>permission beforehand. About the end of June Jose Rovira, the general commanding<br>the 29th Division, was arrested somewhere near the front line by a party of<br>police who had been sent from Barcelona. His men sent a delegation to protest at<br>the Ministry of War. It was found that neither the Ministry of War, nor Ortega,<br>the chief of Police, had even been informed of Rovira's arrest. In the whole<br>business the detail that most sticks in my throat, though perhaps it is not of<br>great importance, is that all news of what was happening was kept from the<br>troops at the front. As you will have seen, neither I nor anyone else at the<br>front had heard anything about the suppression of the P.O.U.M. All the P.O.U.M.<br>militia headquarters, Red Aid centres, and so forth were functioning as usual,<br>and as late as 20 June and as far down the line as Lerida, only about 100 miles<br>from Barcelona, no one had heard what was happening. All word of it was kept out<br>of the Barcelona papers (the Valencia papers, which were running the spy<br>stories, did not reach the Aragon front), and no doubt one reason for arresting<br>all the P.O.U.M. militiamen on leave in Barcelona was to prevent them from<br>getting back to the front with the news. The draft with which I had gone up the<br>line on 15 June must have been about the last to go. I am still puzzled to know<br>how the thing was kept secret, for the supply lorries and so forth were still<br>passing to and fro; but there is no doubt that it was kept secret, and, as I<br>have since learned from a number of others, the men in the front line heard<br>nothing till several days later. The motive for all this is clear enough. The<br>attack on Huesca was beginning, the P.O.U.M. militia was still a separate unit,<br>and it was probably feared that if the men knew what was happening they would<br>refuse to fight. Actually nothing of the kind happened when the news arrived. In<br>the intervening days there must have been numbers of men who were killed without<br>ever learning that the newspapers in the rear were calling them Fascists. This<br>kind of thing is a little difficult to forgive. I know it was the usual policy<br>to keep bad news from the troops, and perhaps as a rule that is justified. But<br>it is a different matter to send men into battle and not even tell them that<br>behind their backs their party is being suppressed, their leaders accused of<br>treachery, and their friends and relatives thrown into prison.<br><br>My wife began telling me what had happened to our various friends. Some of<br>the English and other foreigners had got across the frontier. Williams and<br>Stafford Cottman had not been arrested when the Sanatorium Maurin was raided,<br>and were in hiding somewhere. So was John Mc-Nair, who had been in France and<br>had re-entered Spain after the P.O.U.M. was declared illegal--a rash thing to<br>do, but he had not cared to stay in safety while his comrades were in danger.<br>For the rest it was simply a chronicle of 'They've got so and so' and 'They've<br>got so and so'. They seemed to have 'got' nearly everyone. It took me aback to<br>hear that they had also 'got' George Kopp.<br><br>'What! Kopp? I thought he was in Valencia.'<br><br>It appeared that Kopp had come back to Barcelona; he had a letter from the<br>Ministry of War to the colonel commanding the engineering operations on the<br>eastern front. He knew that the P.O.U.M. had been suppressed, of course, but<br>probably it did not occur to him that the police could be such fools as to<br>arrest him when he was on his way to the front on an urgent military mission. He<br>had come round to the Hotel Continental to fetch his kit-bags; my wife had been<br>out at the time, and the hotel people had managed to detain him with some lying<br>story while they rang up the police. I admit I was angry when I heard of Kopp's<br>arrest. He was my personal friend, I had served under him for months, I had been<br>under fire with him, and I knew his history. He was a man who had sacrificed<br>everything--family, nationality, livelihood--simply to come to Spain and fight<br>against Fascism. By leaving Belgium without permission and joining a foreign<br>army while he was on the Belgian Army reserve, and, earlier, by helping to<br>manufacture munitions illegally for the Spanish Government, he had piled up<br>years of imprisonment for himself if he should ever return to his own country.<br>He had been in the line since October 1936, had worked his way up from<br>militiaman to major, had been in action I do not know how many times, and had<br>been wounded once. During the May trouble, as I had seen for myself, he had<br>prevented fighting locally and probably saved ten or twenty lives. And all they<br>could do in return was to fling him into jail. It is waste of time to be angry,<br>but the stupid malignity of this kind of thing does try one's patience.<br><br>Meanwhile they had not 'got' my wife. Although she had remained at the<br>Continental the police had made no move to arrest her. It was fairly obvious<br>that she was being used as a decoy duck. A couple of nights earlier, however, in<br>the small hours of the morning, six of the plain--clothes police had invaded our<br>room at the hotel and searched it. They had seized every scrap of paper we<br>possessed, except, fortunately, our passports and cheque-book. They had taken my<br>diaries, all our books, all the press-cuttings that had been piling up for<br>months past (I have often wondered what use those press-cuttings were to them),<br>all my war souvenirs, and all our letters. (Incidentally, they took away a<br>number of letters I had received from readers. Some of them had not been<br>answered, and of course I have not the addresses. If anyone who wrote to me<br>about my last book, and did not get an answer, happens to read these lines, will<br>he please accept this as an apology?) I learned afterwards that the police had<br>also seized various belongings that I had left at the Sanatorium Maunn. They<br>even carried off a bundle of my dirty linen. Perhaps they thought it had<br>messages written on it in invisible ink.<br><br>It was obvious that it would be safer for my wife to stay at the hotel, at<br>any rate for the time being. If she tried to disappear they would be after her<br>immediately. As for myself, I should have to go straight into hiding. The<br>prospect revolted me. In spite of the innumerable arrests it was almost<br>impossible for me to believe that I was in any danger. The whole thing seemed<br>too meaningless. It was the same refusal to take this idiotic onslaught<br>seriously that had led Kopp into jail. I kept saying, but why should anyone want<br>to arrest me? What had I done? I was not even a party member of the P.O.U.M.<br>Certainly I had carried arms during the May fighting, but so had (at a guess)<br>forty or fifty thousand people. Besides, I was badly in need of a proper night's<br>sleep. I wanted to risk it and go back to the hotel. My wife would not hear of<br>it. Patiently she explained the state of affairs. It did not matter what I had<br>done or not done. This was not a round-up of criminals; it was merely a reign of<br>terror. I was not guilty of any definite act, but I was guilty of 'Trotskyism'.<br>The fact that I had served in the P.O.U.M. militia was quite enough to get me<br>into prison. It was no use hanging on to the English notion that you are safe so<br>long as you keep the law. Practically the law was what the police chose to make<br>it. The only thing to do was to lie low and conceal the fact that I had anything<br>to do with the P.O.U.M. We went through the papers in my pockets. My wife made<br>me tear up my militiaman's card, which had P.O.U.M. on it in big letters, also a<br>photo of a group of militiamen with a P.O.U.M. flag in the background; that was<br>the kind of thing that got you arrested nowadays. I had to keep my discharge<br>papers, however. Even these were a danger, for they bore the seal of the 29th<br>Division, and the police would probably know that the 29th Division was the<br>P.O.U.M.; but without them I could be arrested as a deserter.<br><br>The thing we had got to think of now was getting out of Spain. There was no<br>sense in staying here with the certainty of imprisonment sooner or later. As a<br>matter of fact both of us would greatly have liked to stay, just to see what<br>happened. But I foresaw that Spanish prisons would be lousy places (actually<br>they were a lot worse than I imagined), once in prison you never knew when you<br>would get out, and I was in wretched health, apart from the pain in my arm. We<br>arranged to meet next day at the British Consulate, where Cottman and McNair<br>were also coming. It would probably take a couple of days to get our passports<br>in order. Before leaving Spain you had to have your passport stamped in three<br>separate places--by the Chief of Police, by the French Consul, and by the<br>Catalan immigration authorities. The Chief of Police was the danger, of course.<br>But perhaps the British Consul could fix things up without letting it be known<br>that we had anything to do with the P.O.U.M. Obviously there must be a list of<br>foreign 'Trotskyist' suspects, and very likely our names were on it, but with<br>luck we might get to the frontier before the list. There was sure to be a lot of<br>muddle and manana. Fortunately this was Spain and not Germany. The Spanish<br>secret police had some of the spirit of the Gestapo, but not much of its<br>Competence.<br><br>So we parted. My wife went back to the hotel and I wandered off into the<br>darkness to find somewhere to sleep. I remember feeling sulky and bored. I had<br>so wanted a night in bed! There was nowhere I could go, no house where I could<br>take refuge. The P.O.U.M. had practically no underground organization. No doubt<br>the leaders had always realized that the party was likely to be suppressed, but<br>they had never expected a wholesale witch-hunt of this description. They had<br>expected it so little, indeed, that they were actually continuing the<br>alterations to the P.O.U.M. buildings (among other things they were constructing<br>a cinema in the Executive Building, which had previously been a bank) up to the<br>very day when the P.O.U.M. was suppressed. Consequently the rendezvous and<br>hiding-places which every revolutionary party ought to possess as a matter of<br>course did not exist. Goodness knows how many people--people whose homes had<br>been raided by the police--were sleeping in the streets that night. I had had<br>five days of tiresome journeys, sleeping in impossible places, my arm was<br>hurting damnably, and now these fools were chasing me to and fro and I had got<br>to sleep on the ground again. That was about as far as my thoughts went. I did<br>not make any of the correct political reflections. I never do when things are<br>happening. It seems to be always the case when I get mixed up in war or politics<br>--I am conscious of nothing save physical discomfort and a deep desire for this<br>damned nonsense to be over. Afterwards I can see the significance of events, but<br>while they are happening I merely want to be out of them--an ignoble trait,<br>perhaps.<br><br>I walked a long way and fetched up somewhere near the General Hospital. I<br>wanted a place where I could lie down without some nosing policeman finding me<br>and demanding my papers. I tried an air-raid shelter, but it was newly dug and<br>dripping with damp. Then I came upon the ruins of a church that had been gutted<br>and burnt in the revolution. It was a mere shell, four roofless walls<br>surrounding piles of rubble. In the half-darkness I poked about and found a kind<br>of hollow where I could lie down. Lumps of broken masonry are not good to lie<br>on, but fortunately it was a warm night and I managed to get several hours'<br>sleep.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/11.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/13.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
