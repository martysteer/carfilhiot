<h2>Chapter 11</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>IT will never be possible to get a completely accurate and unbiased account<br>of the Barcelona fighting, because the necessary records do not exist. Future<br>historians will have nothing to go upon except a mass of accusations and party<br>propaganda. I myself have little data beyond what I saw with my own eyes and<br>what I have learned from other eyewitnesses whom I believe to be reliable. I<br>can, however, contradict some of the more flagrant lies and help to get the<br>affair into some kind of perspective.<br><br>First of all, what actually happened?<br><br>For some time past there had been tension throughout Catalonia. In earlier<br>chapters of this book I have given some account of the struggle between<br>Communists and Anarchists. By May 1937 things had reached a point at which some<br>kind of violent outbreak could be regarded as inevitable. The immediate cause of<br>friction was the Government's order to surrender all private weapons, coinciding<br>with the decision to build up a heavily-armed 'non-political' police-force from<br>which trade union members were to be excluded. The meaning of this was obvious<br>to everyone; and it was also obvious that the next move would be the taking over<br>of some of the key industries controlled by the C.N.T. In addition there was a<br>certain amount of resentment among the working classes because of the growing<br>contrast of wealth and poverty and a general vague feeling that the revolution<br>had been sabotaged. Many people were agreeably surprised when there was no<br>rioting on i May. On 3 May the Government decided to take over the Telephone<br>Exchange, which had been operated since the beginning of the war mainly by<br>C.N.T. workers; it was alleged that it was badly run and that official calls<br>were being tapped. Salas, the Chief of Police (who may or may not have been<br>exceeding his orders), sent three lorry-loads of armed Civil Guards to seize the<br>building, while the streets outside were cleared by armed police in civilian<br>clothes. At about the same time bands of Civil Guards seized various other<br>buildings in strategic spots. Whatever the real intention may have been, there<br>was a widespread belief that this was the signal for a general attack on the<br>C.N.T. by the Civil Guards and the P.S.U.C. (Communists and Socialists). The<br>word flew round the town that the workers' buildings were being attacked, armed<br>Anarchists appeared on the streets, work ceased, and fighting broke out<br>immediately. That night and the next morning barricades were built all over the<br>town, and there was no break in the fighting until the morning of 6 May. The<br>fighting was, however, mainly defensive on both sides. Buildings were besieged,<br>but, so far as I know, none were stormed, and there was no use of artillery.<br>Roughly speaking, the C.N.T.-F.A.I.-P.O.U.M. forces held the working-class<br>suburbs, and the armed police-forces and the P.S.U.C. held the central and<br>official portion of the town. On 6 May there was an armistice, but fighting soon<br>broke out again, probably because of premature attempts by Civil Guards to<br>disarm C.N.T. workers. Next morning, however, the people began to leave the<br>barricades of their own accord. Up till, roughly, the night of 5 May the C.N.T.<br>had had the better of it, and large numbers of Civil Guards had surrendered. But<br>there was no generally accepted leadership and no fixed plan--indeed, so far as<br>one could judge, no plan at all except a vague determination to resist the Civil<br>Guards. The official leaders of the C.N.T. had joined with those of the U.G.T.<br>in imploring everyone to go back to work; above all, food was running short. In<br>such circumstances nobody was sure enough of the issue to go on fighting. By the<br>afternoon of 7 May conditions were almost normal. That evening six thousand<br>Assault Guards, sent by sea from Valencia, arrived and took control of the town.<br>The Government issued an order for the surrender of all arms except those held<br>by the regular forces, and during the next few days large numbers of arms were<br>seized. The casualties during the fighting were officially given out as four<br>hundred killed and about a thousand wounded. Four hundred killed is possibly an<br>exaggeration, but as there is no way of verifying this we must accept it as<br>accurate.<br><br>Secondly, as to the after-effects of the fighting. Obviously it is impossible<br>to say with any certainty what these were. There is no evidence that the<br>outbreak had any direct effect upon the course of the war, though obviously it<br>must have had if it continued even a few days longer. It was made the excuse for<br>bringing Catalonia under the direct control of Valencia, for hastening the<br>break-up of the militias, and for the suppression of the P.O.U.M., and no doubt<br>it also had its share in bringing down the Caballero Government. But we may take<br>it as certain that these things would have happened in any case. The real<br>question is whether the C.N.T. workers who came into the street gained or lost<br>by showing fight on this occasion. It is pure guesswork, but my own opinion is<br>that they gained more than they lost. The seizure of the Barcelona Telephone<br>Exchange was simply one incident in a long process. Since the previous year<br>direct power had been gradually manoeuvred out of the hands of the syndicates,<br>and the general movement was away from working-class control and towards<br>centralized control, leading on to State capitalism or, possibly, towards the<br>reintroduction of private capitalism. The fact that at this point there was<br>resistance probably slowed the process down. A year after the outbreak of war<br>the Catalan workers had lost much of their power, but their position was still<br>comparatively favourable. It might have been much less so if they had made it<br>clear that they would lie down under no matter what provocation. There are<br>occasions when it pays better to fight and be beaten than not to fight at<br>all.<br><br>Thirdly, what purpose, if any, lay behind the outbreak? Was it any kind of<br>coup d'etat or revolutionary attempt? Did it definitely aim at overthrowing the<br>Government? Was it preconcerted at all?<br><br>My own opinion is that the fighting was only preconcerted in the sense that<br>everyone expected it. There were no signs of any very definite plan on either<br>side. On the Anarchist side the action was almost certainly spontaneous, for it<br>was an affair mainly of the rank and file. The people came into the streets and<br>their political leaders followed reluctantly, or did not follow at all. The only<br>people who even talked in a revolutionary strain were the Friends of Durruti, a<br>small extremist group within the F.A.I., and the P.O.U.M. But once again they<br>were following and not leading. The Friends of Durruti distributed some kind of<br>revolutionary leaflet, but this did not appear until 5 May and cannot be said to<br>have started the fighting, which had started of its own accord two days earlier.<br>The official leaders of the C.N.T. disowned the whole affair from the start.<br>There were a number of reasons for this. To begin with, the fact that the C.N.T.<br>was still represented in the Government and the Generalite ensured that its<br>leaders would be more conservative than their followers. Secondly, the main<br>object of the C.N.T. leaders was to form an alliance with the U.G.T., and the<br>fighting was bound to widen the split between C.N.T. and U.G.T., at any rate for<br>the time being. Thirdly--though this was not generally known at the time--the<br>Anarchist leaders feared that if things went beyond a certain point and the<br>workers took possession of the town, as they were perhaps in a position to do on<br>5 May, there would be foreign intervention. A British cruiser and two British<br>destroyers had closed in upon the harbour, and no doubt there were other<br>warships not far away. The English newspapers gave it out that these ships were<br>proceeding to Barcelona 'to protect British interests', but in fact they made no<br>move to do so; that is, they did not land any men or take off any refugees.<br>There can be no certainty about this, but it was at least inherently likely that<br>the British Government, which had not raised a finger to save the Spanish<br>Government from Franco, would intervene quickly enough to save it from its own<br>working class.<br><br>The P.O.U.M. leaders did not disown the affair, in fact they encouraged their<br>followers to remain at the barricades and even gave their approval (in La<br>Batalla, 6 May) to the extremist leaflet issued by the Friends of Durruti.<br>(There is great uncertainty about this leaflet, of which no one now seems able<br>to produce a copy.) In some of the foreign papers it was described as an<br>'inflammatory poster' which was 'plastered' all over the town. There was<br>certainly no such poster. From comparison of various reports I should say that<br>the leaflet called for (i) The formation of a revolutionary council (junta),<br>(ii) The shooting of those responsible for the attack on the Telephone Exchange,<br>(iii) The disarming of the Civil Guards. There is also some uncertainty as to<br>how far La Batalla expressed agreement with the leaflet. I myself did not see<br>the leaflet or La Batalla of that date. The only handbill I saw during the<br>fighting was one issued by the tiny group of Trotskyists ('Bolshevik-Leninists')<br>on 4 May. This merely said: 'Everyone to the barricades--general strike of all<br>industries except war industries.' (In other words, it merely demanded what was<br>happening already.) But in reality the attitude of the P.O.U.M. leaders was<br>hesitating. They had never been in favour of insurrection until the war against<br>Franco was won; on the other hand the workers had come into the streets, and the<br>P.O.U.M. leaders took the rather pedantic Marxist line that when the workers are<br>on the streets it is the duty of the revolutionary parties to be with them.<br>Hence, in spite of uttering revolutionary slogans about the 'reawakening of the<br>spirit of 19 July', and so forth, they did their best to limit the workers'<br>action to the defensive. They never, for instance, ordered an attack on any<br>building; they merely ordered their followers to remain on guard and, as I<br>mentioned in the last chapter, not to fire when it could be avoided. La Batalla<br>also issued instructions that no troops were to leave the front. [Note 9, below]<br>As far as one can estimate it, I should say that the responsibility of the<br>P.O.U.M. amounts to having urged everyone to remain at the barricades, and probably<br>to having persuaded a certain number to remain there longer than they would<br>otherwise have done. Those who were in personal touch with the P.O.U.M. leaders<br>at the time (I myself was not) have told me that they were in reality dismayed<br>by the whole business, but felt that they had got to associate themselves with<br>it. Afterwards, of course, political capital was made out of it in the usual<br>manner. Gorkin, one of the P.O.U.M. leaders, even spoke later of 'the glorious<br>days of May'. From the propaganda point of view this may have been the right<br>line; certainly the P.O.U.M. rose somewhat in numbers during the brief period<br>before its suppression. Tactically it was probably a mistake to give countenance<br>to the leaflet of the Friends of Durruti, which was a very small organization<br>and normally hostile to the P.O.U.M. Considering the general excitement and the<br>things that were being said on both sides, the leaflet did not in effect mean<br>much more than 'Stay at the barricades', but by seeming to approve of it while<br>Solidaridad Obrera, the Anarchist paper, repudiated it, the P.O.U.M. leaders<br>made it easy for the Communist press to say afterwards that the fighting was a<br>kind of insurrection engineered solely by the P.O.U.M. However, we may be<br>certain that the Communist press would have said this in any case. It was<br>nothing compared with the accusations that were made both before and afterwards<br>on less evidence. The C.N.T. leaders did not gain much by their more cautious<br>attitude; they were praised for their loyalty but were levered out of both the<br>Government and the Generalite as soon as the opportunity arose.<br><br>[Note 9. A recent number of Inprecor states the exact opposite--that<br>La Batalla orders the P.O.U.M. troops to leave the front! The point can<br>easily be settled by referring to La Batalla of the date named.]<br><br>So far as one could judge from what people were saying at the time, there was<br>no real revolutionary intention anywhere. The people behind the barricades were<br>ordinary C.N.T. workers, probably with a sprinkling of U.G.T. workers among<br>them, and what they were attempting was not to overthrow the Government but to<br>resist what they regarded, rightly or wrongly, as an attack by the police. Their<br>action was essentially defensive, and I doubt whether it should be described, as<br>it was in nearly all the foreign newspapers, as a 'rising'. A rising implies<br>aggressive action and a definite plan. More exactly it was a riot--a very<br>bloody riot, because both sides had fire-arms in their hands and were willing to<br>use them.<br><br>But what about the intentions on the other side? If it was not an Anarchist<br>coup d'etat, was it perhaps a Communist coup d'etat--a planned effort to smash<br>the power of the C.N.T. at one blow?<br><br>I do not believe it was, though certain things might lead one to suspect it.<br>It is significant that something very similar (seizure of the Telephone Exchange<br>by armed police acting under orders from Barcelona) happened in Tarragona two<br>days later. And in Barcelona the raid on the Telephone Exchange was not an<br>isolated act. In various parts of the town bands of Civil Guards and P.S.U.C.<br>adherents seized buildings in strategic spots, if not actually before the<br>fighting started, at any rate with surprising promptitude. But what one has got<br>to remember is that these things were happening in Spain and not in England.<br>Barcelona is a town with a long history of street-fighting. In such places<br>things happen quickly, the factions are ready-made, everyone knows the local<br>geography, and when the guns begin to shoot people take their places almost as<br>in a fire-drill. Presumably those responsible for the seizure of the Telephone<br>Exchange expected trouble--though not on the scale that actually happened--and<br>had made ready to meet it. But it does not follow that they were planning a<br>general attack on the C.N.T. There are two reasons why I do not believe that<br>either side had made preparations for large-scale fighting:<br><br>(i) Neither side had brought troops to Barcelona beforehand. The fighting was<br>only between those who were in Barcelona already, mainly civilians and<br>police.<br><br>(ii) The food ran short almost immediately. Anyone who has served in Spain<br>knows that the one operation of war that Spaniards really perform really well is<br>that of feeding their troops. It is most unlikely that if either side had<br>contemplated a week or two of street--fighting and a general strike they would<br>not have stored food beforehand.<br><br>Finally, as to the rights and wrongs of the affair.<br><br>A tremendous dust was kicked up in the foreign anti-Fascist press, but, as<br>usual, only one side of the case has had anything like a hearing. As a result<br>the Barcelona fighting has been represented as an insurrection by disloyal<br>Anarchists and Trotskyists who were 'stabbing the Spanish Government in the<br>back', and so forth. The issue was not quite so simple as that. Undoubtedly when<br>you are at war with a deadly enemy it is better not to begin fighting among<br>yourselves; but it is worth remembering that it takes two to make a quarrel and<br>that people do not begin building barricades unless they have received something<br>that they regard as a provocation.<br><br>The trouble sprang naturally out of the Government's order to the Anarchists<br>to surrender their arms. In the English press this was translated into English<br>terms and took this form: that arms were desperately needed on the Aragon front<br>and could not be sent there because the unpatriotic Anarchists were holding them<br>back. To put it like this is to ignore the conditions actually existing in<br>Spain. Everyone knew that both the Anarchists and the P.S.U.C. were hoarding<br>arms, and when the fighting broke out in Barcelona this was made clearer still;<br>both sides produced arms in abundance. The Anarchists were well aware that even<br>if they surrendered their arms, the P.S.U.C., politically the main power in<br>Catalonia, would still retain theirs; and this in fact was what happened after<br>the fighting was over. Meanwhile actually visible on the streets, there were<br>quantities of arms which would have been very welcome at the front, but which<br>were being retained for the 'non-political' police forces in the rear. And<br>underneath this there was the irreconcilable difference between Communists and<br>Anarchists, which was bound to lead to some kind of struggle sooner or later.<br>Since the beginning of the war the Spanish Communist Party had grown enormously<br>in numbers and captured most of the political power, and there had come into<br>Spain thousands of foreign Communists, many of whom were openly expressing their<br>intention of 'liquidating' Anarchism as soon as the war against Franco was won.<br>In the circumstances one could hardly expect the Anarchists to hand over the<br>weapons which they had got possession of in the summer of 1936.<br><br>The seizure of the Telephone Exchange was simply the match that fired an<br>already existing bomb. It is perhaps just conceivable that those responsible<br>imagined that it would not lead to trouble. Company, the Catalan President, is<br>said to have declared laughingly a few days earlier that the Anarchists would<br>put up with anything. [Note 10, below] But certainly it was not a wise action.<br>For months past there had been a long series of armed clashes between<br>Communists and Anarchists in various parts of Spain. Catalonia and<br>especially Barcelona was in a state of tension that had already led<br>to street affrays, assassinations, and so forth. Suddenly the news ran round<br>the city that armed men were attacking the buildings that the workers had<br>captured in the July fighting and to which they attached great sentimental<br>importance. One must remember that the Civil Guards were not loved by the<br>working-class population. For generations past la guardia. had been simply an<br>appendage of the landlord and the boss, and the Civil Guards were doubly hated<br>because they were suspected, quite justly, of being of very doubtful loyalty<br>against the Fascists. [Note 11, below] It is probable that the emotion<br>that brought people into the streets in the first few hours was much the<br>same emotion as had led them to resist the rebel generals at the<br>beginning of the war. Of course it is arguable that the C.N.T. workers ought<br>to have handed over the Telephone Exchange without protest. One's opinion here<br>will be governed by one's attitude on the question of centralized government and<br>working-class control. More relevantly it may be said: 'Yes, very likely the<br>C.N.T. had a case. But, after all, there was a war on, and they had no business<br>to start a fight behind the lines.' Here I agree entirely. Any internal disorder<br>was likely to aid Franco. But what actually precipitated the fighting? The<br>Government may or may not have had the right to seize the Telephone Exchange;<br>the point is that in the actual circumstances it was bound to lead to a fight.<br>It was a provocative action, a gesture which said in effect, and presumably was<br>meant to say: 'Your power is at an end--we are taking over.' It was not common<br>sense to expect anything but resistance. If one keeps a sense of proportion one<br>must realize that the fault was not--could not be, in a matter of this kind--<br>entirely on one side. The reason why a one-sided version has been accepted is<br>simply that the Spanish revolutionary parties have no footing in the foreign<br>press. In the English press, in particular, you would have to search for a long<br>time before finding any favourable reference, at any period of the war, to the<br>Spanish Anarchists. They have been systematically denigrated, and, as I know by<br>my own experience, it is almost impossible to get anyone to print anything in<br>their defence.<br><br>[Note 10. New Statesman (14 May).]<br><br>[Note 11. At the outbreak of war the Civil Guards had<br>everywhere sided with the stronger party. On several occasions later in the war,<br>e.g. at Santander, the local Civil Guards went over to the Fascists in a<br>body.]<br><br>I have tried to write objectively about the Barcelona fighting, though,<br>obviously, no one can be completely objective on a question of this kind. One is<br>practically obliged to take sides, and it must be clear enough which side I am<br>on. Again, I must inevitably have made mistakes of fact, not only here but in<br>other parts of this narrative. It is very difficult to write accurately about<br>the Spanish war, because of the lack of non-propagandist documents. I warn<br>everyone against my bias, and I warn everyone against my mistakes. Still, I have<br>done my best to be honest. But it will be seen that the account I have given is<br>completely different from that which appeared in the foreign and especially the<br>Communist press. It is necessary to examine the Communist version, because it<br>was published all over the world, has been supplemented at short intervals ever<br>since, and is probably the most widely accepted one.<br><br>In the Communist and pro-Communist press the entire blame for the Barcelona<br>fighting was laid upon the P.O.U.M. The affair was represented not as a<br>spontaneous outbreak, but as a deliberate, planned insurrection against the<br>Government, engineered solely by the P.O.U.M. with the aid of a few misguided<br>'uncontrollables'. More than this, it was definitely a Fascist plot, carried out<br>under Fascist orders with the idea of starting civil war in the rear and thus<br>paralysing the Government. The P.O.U.M. was 'Franco's Fifth Column'--a<br>'Trotskyist' organization working in league with the Fascists. According to the<br>Daily Worker (11 May):<br><br>   The German and Italian agents, who poured into Barcelona ostensibly to<br>   'prepare' the notorious 'Congress of the Fourth International', had one big<br>   task. It was this:<br><br>   They were--in cooperation with the local Trotskyists--to prepare a<br>   situation of disorder and bloodshed, in which it would be possible for the<br>   Germans and Italians to declare that they were 'unable to exercise naval<br>   control of the Catalan coasts effectively because of the disorder prevailing<br>   in Barcelona' and were, therefore, 'unable to do otherwise than land forces in<br>   Barcelona'.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, what was being prepared was a situation in which the German<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Italian Governments could land troops or marines quite openly on the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalan coasts, declaring that they were doing so 'in order to preserve<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order'. . . .<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instrument for all this lay ready to hand for the Germans and Italians<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the shape of the Trotskyist organization known as the P.O.U.M.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.O.U.M., acting in cooperation with well-known criminal elements, and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with certain other deluded persons in the Anarchist organizations planned,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organized, and led the attack in the rearguard, accurately timed to coincide<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the attack on the front at Bilbao, etc., etc.<br><br>Later in the article the Barcelona fighting becomes 'the P.O.U.M. attack',<br>and in another article in the same issue it is stated that there is 'no doubt<br>that it is at the door of the P.O.U.M. that the responsibility for the bloodshed<br>in Catalonia must be laid'. Inprecor (29 May) states that those who erected the<br>barricades in Barcelona were 'only members of the P.O.U.M. organized from that<br>party for this purpose'.<br><br>I could quote a great deal more, but this is clear enough. The P.O.U.M. was<br>wholly responsible and the P.O.U.M. was acting under Fascist orders. In a moment<br>I will give some more extracts from the accounts that appeared in the Communist<br>press; it will be seen that they are so self-contradictory as to be completely<br>worthless. But before doing so it is worth pointing to several a priori reasons<br>why this version of the May fighting as a Fascist rising engineered by the<br>P.O.U.M. is next door to incredible.<br><br>(i) The P.O.U.M. had not the numbers or influence to provoke disorders of<br>this magnitude. Still less had it the power to call a general strike. It was a<br>political organization with no very definite footing in the trade unions, and it<br>would have been hardly more capable of producing a strike throughout Barcelona<br>than (say) the English Communist Party would be of producing a general strike<br>throughout Glasgow. As I said earlier, the attitude of the P.O.U.M. leaders may<br>have helped to prolong the fighting to some extent; but they could not have<br>originated it even if they had wanted to.<br><br>(ii) The alleged Fascist plot rests on bare assertion and all the evidence<br>points in the other direction. We are told that the plan was for the German and<br>Italian Governments to land troops in Catalonia; but no German or Italian<br>troopships approached the coast. As to the 'Congress of the Fourth<br>International' and the' German and Italian agents', they are pure myth. So far<br>as I know there had not even been any talk of a Congress of the Fourth<br>International. There were vague plans for a Congress of the P.O.U.M. and its<br>brother-parties (English I.L.P., German S.A.P., etc., etc.); this had been<br>tentatively fixed for some time in July--two months later--and not a single<br>delegate had yet arrived. The 'German and Italian agents' have no existence<br>outside the pages of the Daily Worker. Anyone who crossed the frontier at that<br>time knows that it was not so easy to 'pour' into Spain, or out of it, for that<br>matter.<br><br>(iii) Nothing happened either at Lerida, the chief stronghold of the<br>P.O.U.M., or at the front. It is obvious that if the P.O.U.M. leaders had wanted<br>to aid the Fascists they would have ordered their militia to walk out of the<br>line and let the Fascists through. But nothing of the kind was done or<br>suggested. Nor were any extra men brought out of the line beforehand, though it<br>would have been easy enough to smuggle, say, a thousand or two thousand men back<br>to Barcelona on various pretexts. And there was no attempt even at indirect<br>sabotage of the front. The transport of food, munitions, and so forth continued<br>as usual; I verified this by inquiry afterwards. Above all, a planned rising of<br>the kind suggested would have needed months of preparation, subversive<br>propaganda among the militia, and so forth. But there was no sign or rumour of<br>any such thing. The fact that the militia at the front played no part in the<br>'rising' should be conclusive. If the P.O.U.M. were really planning a coup<br>d'etat it is inconceivable that they would not have used the ten thousand or so<br>armed men who were the only striking force they had.<br><br>It will be clear enough from this that the Communist thesis of a P.O.U.M.<br>'rising' under Fascist orders rests on less than no evidence. I will add a few<br>more extracts from the Communist press. The Communist accounts of the opening<br>incident, the raid on the Telephone Exchange, are illuminating; they agree in<br>nothing except in putting the blame on the other side. It is noticeable that in<br>the English Communist papers the blame is put first upon the Anarchists and only<br>later upon the P.O.U.M. There is a fairly obvious reason for this. Not everyone<br>in England has heard of'Trotskyism', whereas every English-speaking person<br>shudders at the name of 'Anarchist'. Let it once be known that 'Anarchists' are<br>implicated, and the right atmosphere of prejudice is established; after that the<br>blame can safely be transferred to the 'Trotskyists'. The Daily Worker begins<br>thus (6 May):<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minority gang of Anarchists on Monday and Tuesday seized and attempted to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold the telephone and telegram buildings, and started firing into the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;street.<br><br>There is nothing like starting off with a reversal of roles. The Civil Guards<br>attack a building held by the C.N.T.; so the C.N.T. are represented as attacking<br>their own building attacking themselves, in fact. On the other hand, the Daily<br>Worker of 11 May states:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Left Catalan Minister of Public Security, Aiguade, and the United<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Socialist General Commissar of Public Order, Rodrigue Salas, sent the armed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;republican police into the Telefonica building to disarm the employees there,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most of them members of C.N.T. unions.<br><br>This does not seem to agree very well with the first statement; nevertheless<br>the Daily Worker contains no admission that the first statement was wrong. The<br>Daily Worker of 11 May states that the leaflets of the Friends of Durruti, which<br>were disowned by the C.N.T., appeared on 4 May and 5 May, during the fighting.<br>Inprecor (22 May) states that they appeared on 3 May, before the fighting, and<br>adds that 'in view of these facts' (the appearance of various leaflets):<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police, led by the Prefect of Police in person, occupied the central<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;telephone exchange in the afternoon of 3 May. The police were shot at while<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discharging their duty. This was the signal for the provocateurs to begin<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shooting affrays all over the city.<br><br>And here is Inprecor for 29 May:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At three o'clock in the afternoon the Commissar for Public Security,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comrade Salas, went to the Telephone Exchange, which on the previous night had<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been occupied by 50 members of the P.O.U.M. and various uncontrollable<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elements.<br><br>This seems rather curious. The occupation of the Telephone Exchange by 50<br>P.O.U.M. members is what one might call a picturesque circumstance, and one<br>would have expected somebody to notice it at the time. Yet it appears that it<br>was discovered only three or four weeks later. In another issue of Inprecor the<br>50 P.O.U.M. members become 50 P.O.U.M. militiamen. It would be difficult to pack<br>together more contradictions than are contained in these few short passages. At<br>one moment the C.N.T. are attacking the Telephone Exchange, the next they are<br>being attacked there; a leaflet appears before the seizure of the Telephone<br>Exchange and is the cause of it, or, alternatively, appears afterwards and is<br>the result of it; the people in the Telephone Exchange are alternatively C.N.T.<br>members and P.O.U.M. members--and so on. And in a still later issue of the<br>Daily Worker (3 June) Mr J. R. Campbell informs us that the Government only<br>seized the Telephone Exchange because the barricades were already erected!<br><br>For reasons of space I have taken only the reports of one incident, but the<br>same discrepancies run all through the accounts in the Communist press. In<br>addition there are various statements which are obviously pure fabrication. Here<br>for instance is something quoted by the Daily Worker (7 May) and said to have<br>been issued by the Spanish Embassy in Paris:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant feature of the uprising has been that the old monarchist flag<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was flown from the balcony of various houses in Barcelona, doubtless in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;belief that those who took part in the rising had become masters of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;situation.<br><br>The Daily Worker very probably reprinted this statement in good faith, but<br>those responsible for it at the Spanish Embassy must have been quite<br>deliberately lying. Any Spaniard would understand the internal situation better<br>than that. A monarchist flag in Barcelona! It was the one thing that could have<br>united the warring factions in a moment. Even the Communists on the spot were<br>obliged to smile when they read about it. It is the same with the reports in the<br>various Communist papers upon the arms supposed to have been used by the<br>P.O.U.M. during the 'rising'. They would be credible only if one knew nothing<br>whatever of the facts. In the Daily Worker of 17 May Mr Frank Pitcairn<br>states:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were actually all sorts of arms used by them in the outrage. There<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were the arms which they have been stealing for months past, and hidden, and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there were arms such as tanks, which they stole from the barracks just at the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning of the rising. It is clear that scores of machine-guns and several<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand rifles are still in their possession.<br><br>Inprecor (29 May) also states:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3 May the P.O.U.M. had at its disposal some dozens of machine-guns and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several thousand rines. ... On the Plaza de Espana the Trotskyists brought<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into action batteries of '75' guns which were destined for the front in Aragon<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and which the militia had carefully concealed on their premises.<br><br>Mr Pitcairn does not tell us how and when it became dear that the P.O.U.M.<br>possessed scores of machine-guns and several thousand rifles. I have given an<br>estimate of the arms which were at three of the principal P.O.U.M. buildings--<br>about eighty rifles, a few bombs, and no machine-guns; i.e. about sufficient for<br>the armed guards which, at that time, all the political parties placed on their<br>buildings. It seems strange that afterwards, when the P.O.U.M. was suppressed<br>and all its buildings seized, these thousands of weapons never came to light;<br>especially the tanks and field-guns, which are not the kind of thing that can be<br>hidden up the chimney. But what is revealing in the two statements above is the<br>complete ignorance they display of the local circumstances. According to Mr<br>Pitcairn the P.O.U.M. stole tanks 'from the barracks'. He does not tell us which<br>barracks. The P.O.U.M. militiamen who were in Barcelona (now comparatively few,<br>as direct recruitment to the party militias had ceased) shared the Lenin<br>Barracks with a considerably larger number of Popular Army troops. Mr Pitcaim is<br>asking us to believe, therefore, that the P.O.U.M. stole tanks with the<br>connivance of the Popular Army. It is the same with the 'premises' on which the<br>75-mm. guns were concealed. There is no mention of where these 'premises' were.<br>Those batteries of guns, firing on the Plaza de Espana, appeared in many<br>newspaper reports, but I think we can say with certainty that they never<br>existed. As I mentioned earlier, I heard no artillery-fire during the fighting,<br>though the Plaza de Espana was only a mile or so away. A few days later I<br>examined the Plaza de Espana and could find no buildings that showed marks of<br>shell-fire. And an eye-witness who was in that neighbourhood throughout the<br>fighting declares that no guns ever appeared there. (Incidentally, the tale of<br>the stolen guns may have originated with Antonov-Ovseenko, the Russian<br>Consul-General. He, at any rate, communicated it to a well-known English<br>journalist, who afterwards repeated it in good faith in a weekly paper.<br>Antonov-Ovseenko has since been 'purged'. How this would affect his credibility<br>I do not know.) The truth is, of course, that these tales about tanks,<br>field-guns, and so forth have only been invented because otherwise it is<br>difficult to reconcile the scale of the Barcelona fighting with the P.O.U.M.'S<br>small numbers. It was necessary to claim that the P.O.U.M. was wholly<br>responsible for the fighting; it was also necessary to claim that it was an<br>insignificant party with no following and 'numbered only a few thousand<br>members', according to Inprecor. The only hope of making both statements<br>credible was to pretend that the P.O.U.M. had all the weapons of a modern<br>mechanized army.<br><br>It is impossible to read through the reports in the Communist Press without<br>realizing that they are consciously aimed at a public ignorant of the facts and<br>have no other purpose than to work up prejudice. Hence, for instance, such<br>statements as Mr Pitcairn's in the Daily Worker of 11 May that the 'rising' was<br>suppressed by the Popular Army. The idea here is to give outsiders the<br>impression that all Catalonia was solid against the 'Trotskyists'. But the<br>Popular Army remained neutral throughout the fighting; everyone in Barcelona<br>knew this, and it is difficult to believe that Mr Pitcairn did not know it too.<br>Or again, the juggling in the Communist Press with the figures for killed and<br>wounded, with the object of exaggerating the scale of the disorders. Diaz,<br>General Secretary of the Spanish Communist Party, widely quoted in the Communist<br>Press, gave the numbers as 900 dead and 2500 wounded. The Catalan Minister of<br>Propaganda, who was hardly likely to underestimate, gave the numbers as 400<br>killed and 1000 wounded. The Communist Party doubles the bid and adds a few more<br>hundreds for luck.<br><br>The foreign capitalist newspapers, in general, laid the blame for the<br>fighting upon the Anarchists, but there were a few that followed the Communist<br>line. One of these was the English News Chronicle, whose correspondent, Mr John<br>Langdon-Davies, was in Barcelona at the tune I quote portions of his article<br>here:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A TROTSKYIST REVOLT<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . This has not been an Anarchist uprising. It is a frustrated putsch of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 'Trotskyist' P.O.U.M., working through their controlled organizations,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Friends of Durruti' and Libertarian Youth. . . . The tragedy began on Monday<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afternoon when the Government sent armed police into the Telephone Building,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to disarm the workers there, mostly C.N.T. men. Grave irregularities in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service had been a scandal for some time. A large crowd gathered in the Plaza<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;de Cataluna outside, while the C.N.T. men resisted, retreating floor by floor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the top of the building. . . . The incident was very obscure, but word went<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;round that the Government was out against the Anarchists. The streets filled<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with armed men. . . . By nightfall every workers' centre and Government<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;building was barricaded, and at ten o'clock the first volleys were fired and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first ambulances began ringing their way through the streets. By dawn all<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barcelona was under fire. ... As the day wore on and the dead mounted to over<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a hundred, one could make a guess at what was happening. The Anarchist C.N.T.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Socialist U.G.T. were not technically 'out in the street'. So long as they<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remained behind the barricades they were merely watchfully waiting, an<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attitude which included the right to shoot at anything armed in the open<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;street. . . (the) general bursts were invariably aggravated by pacos--hidden<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solitary men, usually Fascists, shooting from roof--tops at nothing in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular, but doing all they could to add to the general panic.. . . By<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday evening, however, it began to be clear who was behind the revolt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the walls had been plastered with an inflammatory poster calling for an<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediate revolution and for the shooting of Republican and Socialist leaders.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was signed by the 'Friends of Durruti'. On Thursday morning the Anarchists<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daily denied all knowledge or sympathy with it, but La Batalla, the P.O.U.M.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paper, reprinted the document with the highest praise. Barcelona, the first<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city of Spain, was plunged into bloodshed by agents provocateurs using this<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subversive organization.<br><br>This does not agree very completely with the Communist versions I have quoted<br>above, but it will be seen that even as it stands it is self--contradictory.<br>First the affair is described as 'a Trotskyist revolt', then it is shown to have<br>resulted from a raid on the Telephone building and the general belief that the<br>Government was 'out against' the Anarchists. The city is barricaded and both<br>C.N.T. and U.G.T. are behind the barricades; two days afterwards the<br>inflammatory poster (actually a leaflet) appears, and this is declared by<br>implication to have started the whole business--effect preceding cause. But<br>there is a piece of very serious misrepresentation here. Mr Langdon-Davies<br>describes the Friends of Durruti and Libertarian Youth as 'controlled<br>organizations' of the P.O.U.M. Both were Anarchist organizations and had no<br>connexion with the P.O.U.M. The Libertarian Youth was the youth league of the<br>Anarchists, corresponding to the J.S.U. of the P.S.U.C., etc. The Friends of<br>Durruti was a small organization within the F.A.I., and was in general bitterly<br>hostile to the P.O.U.M. So far as I can discover, there was no one who was a<br>member of both. It would be about equally true to say that the Socialist League<br>is a 'controlled organization' of the English Liberal Party. Was Mr<br>Langdon-Davies unaware of this? If he was, he should have written with more<br>caution about this very complex subject.<br><br>I am not attacking Mr Langdon-Davies's good faith; but admittedly he left<br>Barcelona as soon as the fighting was over, i.e. at the moment when he could<br>have begun serious inquiries, and throughout his report there are clear signs<br>that he has accepted the official version of a 'Trotskyist revolt' without<br>sufficient verification. This is obvious even in the extract I have quoted. 'By<br>nightfall' the barricades are built, and 'at ten o'clock' the first volleys are<br>fired. These are not the words of an eye-witness. From this you would gather<br>that it is usual to wait for your enemy to build a barricade before beginning to<br>shoot at him. The impression given is that some hours elapsed between the<br>building of the barricades and the firing of the first volleys; whereas--<br>naturally--it was the other way about. I and many others saw the first volleys<br>fired early in the afternoon. Again, there are the solitary men, 'usually<br>Fascists', who are shooting from the roof--tops. Mr Langdon-Davies does not<br>explain how he knew that these men were Fascists. Presumably he did not climb on<br>to the roofs and ask them. He is simply repeating what he has been told and, as<br>it fits in with the official version, is not questioning it. As a matter of<br>fact, he indicates one probable source of much of his information by an<br>incautious reference to the Minister of Propaganda at the beginning of his<br>article. Foreign journalists in Spain were hopelessly at the mercy of the<br>Ministry of Propaganda, though one would think that the very name of this<br>ministry would be a sufficient warning. The Minister of Propaganda was, of<br>course, about as likely to give an objective account of the Barcelona trouble as<br>(say) the late Lord Carson would have been to give an objective account of the<br>Dublin rising of 1916.<br><br>I have given reasons for thinking that the Communist version of the Barcelona<br>fighting cannot be taken seriously. In addition I must say something about the<br>general charge that the P.O.U.M. was a secret Fascist organization in the pay of<br>Franco and Hitler.<br><br>This charge was repeated over and over in the Communist Press, especially<br>from the beginning of 1937 onwards. It was part of the world-wide drive of the<br>official Communist Party against 'Trotskyism', of which the P.O.U.M. was<br>supposed to be representative in Spain. 'Trotskyism', according to Frente Rojo<br>(the Valencia Communist paper) 'is not a political doctrine. Trotskyism is an<br>official capitalist organization, a Fascist terrorist band occupied in crime and<br>sabotage against the people.' The P.O.U.M. was a 'Trotskyist' organization in<br>league with the Fascists and part of 'Franco's Fifth Column'. What was<br>noticeable from the start was that no evidence was produced in support of this<br>accusation; the thing was simply asserted with an air of authority. And the<br>attack was made with the maximum of personal libel and with complete<br>irresponsibility as to any effects it might have upon the war. Compared with the<br>job of libelling the P.O.U.M., many Communist writers appear to have considered<br>the betrayal of military secrets unimportant. In a February number of the Daily<br>Worker, for instance, a writer (Winifred Bates) is allowed to state that the<br>P.O.U.M. had only half as many troops on its section of the front as it<br>pretended. This was not true, but presumably the writer believed it to be true.<br>She and the Daily Worker were perfectly willing, therefore, to hand to the enemy<br>one of the most important pieces of information that can be handed through the<br>columns of a newspaper. In the New Republic Mr Ralph Bates stated that the<br>P.O.U.M. troops were 'playing football with the Fascists in no man's land' at a<br>time when, as a matter of fact, the P.O.U.M. troops were suffering heavy<br>casualties and a number of my personal friends were killed and wounded. Again,<br>there was the malignant cartoon which was widely circulated, first in Madrid and<br>later in Barcelona, representing the P.O.U.M. as slipping off a mask marked with<br>the hammer and sickle and revealing a face marked with the swastika. Had the<br>Government not been virtually under Communist control it would never have<br>permitted a thing of this kind to be circulated in wartime. It was a deliberate<br>blow at the morale not only of the P.O.U.M. militia, but of any others who<br>happened to be near them; for it is not encouraging to be told that the troops<br>next to you in the line are traitors. As a matter of fact, I doubt whether the<br>abuse that was heaped upon them from the rear actually had the effect of<br>demoralizing the P.O.U.M. militia. But certainly it was calculated to do so, and<br>those responsible for it must be held to have put political spite before<br>anti-Fascist unity.<br><br>The accusation against the P.O.U.M. amounted to this: that a body of some<br>scores of thousands of people, almost entirely working class, besides numerous<br>foreign helpers and sympathizers, mostly refugees from Fascist countries, and<br>thousands of militia, was simply a vast spying organization in Fascist pay. The<br>thing was opposed to common sense, and the past history of the P.O.U.M. was<br>enough to make it incredible. All the P.O.U.M. leaders had revolutionary<br>histories behind them. Some of them had been mixed up in the 1934 revolt, and<br>most of them had been imprisoned for Socialist activities under the Lerroux<br>Government or the monarchy. In 1936 its then leader, Joaquin Maurin, was one of<br>the deputies who gave warning in the Cortes of Franco's impending revolt. Some<br>time after the outbreak of war he was taken prisoner by the Fascists while<br>trying to organize resistance in Franco's rear. When the revolt broke out the<br>P.O.U.M. played a conspicuous part in resisting it, and in Madrid, in<br>particular, many of its members were killed in the street-fighting. It was one<br>of the first bodies to form columns of militia in Catalonia and Madrid. It seems<br>almost impossible to explain these as the actions of a party in Fascist pay. A<br>party in Fascist pay would simply have joined in on the other side.<br><br>Nor was there any sign of pro-Fascist activities during the war. It was<br>arguable--though finally I do not agree--that by pressing for a more<br>revolutionary policy the P.O.U.M. divided the Government forces and thus aided<br>the Fascists;<br><br>I think any Government of reformist type would be justified in regarding a<br>party like the P.O.U.M. as a nuisance. But this is a very different matter from<br>direct treachery. There is no way of explaining why, if the P.O.U.M. was really<br>a Fascist body, its militia remained loyal. Here were eight or ten thousand men<br>holding important parts of the line during the intolerable conditions of the<br>winter of 1936-7. Many of them were in the trenches four or five months at a<br>stretch. It is difficult to see why they did not simply walk out of the line or<br>go over to the enemy. It was always in their power to do so, and at times the<br>effect might have been decisive. Yet they continued to fight, and it was shortly<br>after the P.O.U.M. was suppressed as a political party, when the event was fresh<br>in everyone's mind, that the militia--not yet redistributed among the Popular<br>Army--took part in the murderous attack to the east of Huesca when several<br>thousand men were killed in one or two days. At the very least one would have<br>expected fraternization with the enemy and a constant trickle of deserters. But,<br>as I have pointed out earlier, the number of desertions was exceptionally small.<br>Again, one would have expected pro-Fascist propaganda, 'defeatism', and so<br>forth. Yet there was no sign of any such thing. Obviously there must have been<br>Fascist spies and agents provocateurs in the P.O.U.M.; they exist in all<br>Left-wing parties; but there is no evidence that there were more of them there<br>than elsewhere.<br><br>It is true that some of the attacks in the Communist Press said, rather<br>grudgingly, that only the P.O.U.M. leaders were in Fascist pay, and not the rank<br>and file. But this was merely an attempt to detach the rank and file from their<br>leaders. The nature of the accusation implied that ordinary members, militiamen,<br>and so forth, were all in the plot together; for it was obvious that if Nin,<br>Gorkin, and the others were really in Fascist pay, it was more likely to be<br>known to their followers, who were in contact with them, than to journalists in<br>London, Paris, and New York. And in any case, when the P.O.U.M. was suppressed<br>the Communist-controlled secret police acted on the assumption that all were<br>guilty alike, and arrested everyone connected with the P.O.U.M. whom they could<br>lay hands on, including even wounded men, hospital nurses, wives of P.O.U.M.<br>members, and in some cases, even children.<br><br>Finally, on 15-16 June, the P.O.U.M. was suppressed and declared an illegal<br>organization. This was one of the first acts of the Negrin Government which came<br>into office in May. When the Executive Committee of the P.O.U.M. had been thrown<br>into jail, the Communist Press produced what purported to be the discovery of an<br>enormous Fascist plot. For a while the Communist Press of the whole world was<br>flaming with this kind of thing (Daily Worker, 21 June, summarizing various<br>Spanish Communist papers):<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPANISH TROTSKYISTS PLOT WITH FRANCO<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the arrest of a large number of leading Trotskyists in Barcelona<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and elsewhere . . . there became known, over the weekend, details of one of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most ghastly pieces of espionage ever known in wartime, and the ugliest<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revelation of Trotskyist treachery to date. . . Documents in the possession of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the police, together with the full confession of no less than 200 persons<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under arrest, prove, etc. etc.<br><br>What these revelations 'proved' was that the P.O.U.M. leaders were<br>transmitting military secrets to General Franco by radio, were in touch with<br>Berlin, and were acting in collaboration with the secret Fascist organization in<br>Madrid. In addition there were sensational details about secret messages in<br>invisible ink, a mysterious document signed with the letter N. (standing for<br>Nin), and so on and so forth.<br><br>But the final upshot was this: six months after the event, as I write, most<br>of the P.O.U.M. leaders are still in jail, but they have never been brought to<br>trial, and the charges of communicating with Franco by radio, etc., have never<br>even been formulated. Had they really been guilty of espionage they would have<br>been tried and shot in a week, as so many Fascist spies had been previously. But<br>not a scrap of evidence was ever produced except the unsupported statements in<br>the Communist Press. As for the two hundred 'full confessions', which, if they<br>had existed, would have been enough to convict anybody, they have never been<br>heard of again. They were, in fact, two hundred efforts of somebody's<br>imagination.<br><br>More than this, most of the members of the Spanish Government have disclaimed<br>all belief in the charges against the P.O.U.M. Recently the cabinet decided by<br>five to two in favour of releasing anti-Fascist political prisoners; the two<br>dissentients being the Communist ministers. In August an international<br>delegation headed by James Maxton M.P., went to Spain to inquire into the<br>charges against the P.O.U.M. and the disappearance of Andres Nin. Prieto, the<br>Minister of National Defence, Irujo, the Minister of Justice, Zugazagoitia,<br>Minister of the Interior, Ortega y Gasset, the Procureur-General, Prat Garcia,<br>and others all repudiated any belief in the P.O.U.M. leaders being guilty of<br>espionage. Irujo added that he had been through the dossier of the case, that<br>none of the so-called pieces of evidence would bear examination, and that the<br>document supposed to have been signed by Nin was 'valueless'--i.e. a forgery.<br>Prieto considered the P.O.U.M. leaders to be responsible for the May fighting in<br>Barcelona, but dismissed the idea of their being Fascist spies. 'What is most<br>grave', he added,' is that the arrest of the P.O.U.M. leaders was not decided<br>upon by the Government, and the police carried out these arrests on their own<br>authority. Those responsible are not the heads of the police, but their<br>entourage, which has been infiltrated by the Communists according to their usual<br>custom.' He cited other cases of illegal arrests by the police. Irujo likewise<br>declared that the police had become 'quasi-independent' and were in reality<br>under the control of foreign Communist elements. Prieto hinted fairly broadly to<br>the delegation that the Government could not afford to offend the Communist<br>Party while the Russians were supplying arms. When another delegation, headed by<br>John McGovern M.P., went to Spain in December, they got much the same answers as<br>before, and Zugazagoitia, the Minister of the Interior, repeated Prieto's hint<br>in even plainer terms. 'We have received aid from Russia and have had to permit<br>certain actions which we did not like.' As an illustration of the autonomy of<br>the police, it is interesting to learn that even with a signed order from the<br>Director of Prisons and the Minister of Justice, McGovern and the others could<br>not obtain admission to one of the 'secret prisons' maintained by the Communist<br>Party in Barcelona. [Note 12. For reports on the two delegations see Le<br>Populaire (7 September), Laleche (18 September), Report on the Maxton delegation<br>published by Independent News (219 Rue Saint-Denis, Paris), and McGovern's<br>pamphlet Terror in Spain.]<br><br>I think this should be enough to make the matter clear. The accusation of<br>espionage against the P.O.U.M. rested solely upon articles in the Communist<br>press and the activities of the Communist-controlled secret police. The P.O.U.M.<br>leaders, and hundreds or thousands of their followers, are still in prison, and<br>for six months past the Communist press has continued to clamour for the<br>execution of the 'traitors' But Negrin and the others have kept their heads and<br>refused to stage a wholesale massacre of'Trotskyists'. Considering the pressure<br>that has been put upon them, it is greatly to their credit that they have done<br>so. Meanwhile, in face of what I have quoted above, it becomes very difficult to<br>believe that the P.O.U.M. was really a Fascist spying organization, unless one<br>also believes that Maxton, Mc-Govern, Prieto, Irujo, Zugazagoitia, and the rest<br>are all in Fascist pay together.<br><br>Finally, as to the charge that the P.O.U.M. was 'Trotskyist'. This word is<br>now flung about with greater and greater freedom, and it is used in a way that<br>is extremely misleading and is often intended to mislead. It is worth stopping<br>to define it. The word Trotskyist is used to mean three distinct things:<br><br>(i) One who, like Trotsky, advocates 'world revolution' as against 'Socialism<br>in a single country'. More loosely, a revolutionary extremist.<br><br>(ii) A member of the actual organization of which Trotsky is head.<br><br>(iii) A disguised Fascist posing as a revolutionary who acts especially by<br>sabotage in the U.S.S.R., but, in general, by splitting and undermining the<br>Left-wing forces.<br><br>In sense (i) the P.O.U.M. could probably be described as Trotskyist. So can<br>the English I.L.P., the German S.A.P., the Left Socialists in France, and so on.<br>But the P.O.U.M. had no connexion with Trotsky or the Trotskyist<br>('Bolshevik-Lenninist') organization. When the war broke out the foreign<br>Trotskyists who came to Spain (fifteen or twenty in number) worked at first for<br>the P.O.U.M., as the party nearest to their own viewpoint, but without becoming<br>party-members; later Trotsky ordered his followers to attack the P.O.U.M.<br>policy, and the Trotskyists were purged from the party offices, though a few<br>remained in the militia. Nin, the P.O.U.M. leader after Maurin's capture by the<br>Fascists, was at one time Trotsky's secretary, but had left him some years<br>earlier and formed the P.O.U.M. by the amalgamation of various Opposition<br>Communists with an earlier party, the Workers' and Peasants' Bloc. Nin's<br>one-time association with Trotsky has been used in the Communist press to show<br>that the P.O.U.M. was really Trotskyist.<br><br>By the same line of argument it could be shown that the English Communist<br>Party is really a Fascist organization, because of Mr John Strachey's one-time<br>association with Sir Oswald Mosley.<br><br>In sense (ii), the only exactly defined sense of the word, the P.O.U.M. was<br>certainly not Trotskyist. It is important to make this distinction, because it<br>is taken for granted by the majority of Communists that a Trotskyist in sense<br>(ii) is invariably a Trotskyist in sense (iii)--i.e. that the whole Trotskyist<br>organization is simply a Fascist spying-machine. 'Trotskyism' only came into<br>public notice in the time of the Russian sabotage trials, and to call a man a<br>Trotskyist is practically equivalent to calling him a murderer, agent<br>provocateur, etc. But at the same time anyone who criticizes Communist policy<br>from a Left-wing standpoint is liable to be denounced as a Trotskyist. Is it<br>then asserted that everyone professing revolutionary extremism is in Fascist<br>pay?<br><br>In practice it is or is not, according to local convenience. When Maxton went<br>to Spain with the delegation I have mentioned above, Verdad, Frente Rojo, and<br>other Spanish Communist papers instantly denounced him as a 'Trotsky-Fascist',<br>spy of the Gestapo, and so forth. Yet the English Communists were careful not to<br>repeat this accusation. In the English Communist press Maxton becomes merely a<br>'reactionary enemy of the working class', which is conveniently vague. The<br>reason, of course, is simply that several sharp lessons have given the English<br>Communist press a wholesome dread of the law of libel. The fact that the<br>accusation was not repeated in a country where it might have to be proved is<br>sufficient confession that it is a lie.<br><br>It may seem that I have discussed the accusations against the P.O.U.M. at<br>greater length than was necessary. Compared with the huge miseries of a civil<br>war, this kind of internecine squabble between parties, with its inevitable<br>injustices and false accusations, may appear trivial. It is not really so. I<br>believe that libels and press--campaigns of this kind, and the habits of mind<br>they indicate, are capable of doing the most deadly damage to the anti-Fascist<br>cause.<br><br>Anyone who has given the subject a glance knows that the Communist tactic of<br>dealing with political opponents by means of trumped-up accusations is nothing<br>new. Today the key-word is 'Trotsky-Fascist'; yesterday it was 'Social-Fascist'.<br>It is only six or seven years since the Russian State trials 'proved' that the<br>leaders of the Second International, including, for instance, Leon Blum and<br>prominent members of the British Labour Party, were hatching a huge plot for the<br>military invasion of the U.S.S.R. Yet today the French Communists are glad<br>enough to accept Blum as a leader, and the English Communists are raising heaven<br>and earth to get inside the Labour Party. I doubt whether this kind of thing<br>pays, even from a sectarian point of view. And meanwhile there is no possible<br>doubt about the hatred and dissension that the 'Trotsky-Fascist' accusation is<br>causing. Rank-and--file Communists everywhere are led away on a senseless<br>witch-hunt after 'Trotskyists', and parties of the type of the P.O.U.M. are<br>driven back into the terribly sterile position of being mere anti-Communist<br>parties. There is already the beginning of a dangerous split in the world<br>working-class movement. A few more libels against life-long Socialists, a few<br>more frame-ups like the charges against the P.O.U.M., and the split may become<br>irreconcilable. The only hope is to keep political controversy on a plane where<br>exhaustive discussion is possible. Between the Communists and those who stand or<br>claim to stand to the Left of them there is a real difference. The Communists<br>hold that Fascism can be beaten by alliance with sections of the capitalist<br>class (the Popular Front); their opponents hold that this manoeuvre simply gives<br>Fascism new breeding-grounds. The question has got to be settled; to make the<br>wrong decision may be to land ourselves in for centuries of semi-slavery. But so<br>long as no argument is produced except a scream of 'Trotsky-Fascist!' the<br>discussion cannot even begin. It would be impossible for me, for instance, to<br>debate the rights and wrongs of the Barcelona fighting with a Communist Party<br>member, because no Communist--that is to say, no' good' Communist--could admit<br>that I have given a truthful account of the facts. If he followed his party<br>'line dutifully he would have to declare that I am lying or, at best, that I am<br>hopelessly misled and that anyone who glanced at the Daily Worker headlines a<br>thousand miles from the scene of events knows more of what was happening in<br>Barcelona than I do. In such circumstances there can be no argument; the<br>necessary minimum of agreement cannot be reached. What purpose is served by<br>saying that men like Maxton are in Fascist pay? Only the purpose of making<br>serious discussion impossible. It is as though in the middle of a chess<br>tournament one competitor should suddenly begin screaming that the other is<br>guilty of arson or bigamy. The point that is really at issue remains untouched.<br>Libel settles nothing.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/9.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/11.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
