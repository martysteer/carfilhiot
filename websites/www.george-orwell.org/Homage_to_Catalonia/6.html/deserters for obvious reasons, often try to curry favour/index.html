<h2>Chapter 7</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>ONE afternoon Benjamin told us that he wanted fifteen volunteers. The attack<br>on the Fascist redoubt which had been called off on the previous occasion was <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>be carried out tonight. I oiled my ten Mexican cartridges, dirtied my bayonet<br>(the things give your position away if they flash too much), and packed up a<br>hunk of bread, three inches of red sausage, and a cigar which my wife had sent<br>from Barcelona and which I had been hoarding <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> a long time. Bombs were served<br>out, three <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> a man. The Spanish Government had at last succeeded in producing a<br>decent bomb. It was on the principle of a Mills bomb, but with two pins instead<br>of one. After you had pulled the pins out there was an interval of seven seconds<br>before the bomb exploded. Its chief disadvantage was that one pin was very stiff<br>and the other very loose, so that you had the choice of leaving both pins in<br>place and being unable <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> pull the stiff one out in a moment of emergency, or<br>pulling out the stiff one beforehand and being in a constant stew lest the thing<br>should explode in your pocket. But it was a handy little bomb <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> throw.<br><br>A little before midnight Benjamin led the fifteen of us down <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> Torre Fabian.<br>Ever since evening the rain had been pelting down. The irrigation ditches were<br>brimming over, and every time you stumbled into one you were in water up <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> your<br>waist. In the pitch darkness and sheeting rain in the farm-yard a dim mass of<br>men was waiting. Kopp addressed us, first in Spanish, then in English, and<br>explained the plan of attack. The Fascist line here made an L-bend and the<br>parapet we were <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> attack lay on rising ground at the corner of the L. About<br>thirty of us, half English, and half Spanish, under the command of Jorge Roca,<br>our battalion commander (a battalion in the militia was about four hundred men),<br>and Benjamin, were <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> creep up and cut the Fascist wire. Jorge would fling the<br>first bomb as a signal, then the rest of us were <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> send in a rain of bombs,<br>drive the Fascists out of the parapet, and seize it before they could rally.<br>Simultaneously seventy Shock Troopers were <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> assault the next Fascist<br>'position', which lay two hundred yards <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the right of the other, joined <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> it<br>by a communication-trench. <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">To</B> prevent us from shooting each other in the<br>darkness white armlets would be worn. At this moment a messenger arrived <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> say<br>that there were no white armlets. Out of the darkness a plaintive voice<br>suggested: 'Couldn't we arrange <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> the Fascists <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> wear white armlets<br>instead?'<br><br>There was an hour or two <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> put in. The barn over the mule stable was so<br>wrecked by shell-fire that you could not move about in it without a light. Half<br>the floor had been torn away by a plunging shell and there was a twenty-foot<br>drop on <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the stones beneath. Someone found a pick and levered a burst plank<br>out of the floor, and in a few minutes we had got a fire alight and our drenched<br>clothes were steaming. Someone else produced a pack of cards. A rumour--one of<br>those mysterious rumours that are endemic in war--flew round that hot coffee<br>with brandy in it was about <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> be served out. We filed eagerly down the<br>almost-collapsing staircase and wandered round the dark yard, inquiring where<br>the coffee was <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> be found. Alas! there was no coffee. Instead, they called us<br>together, ranged us into single file, and then Jorge and Benjamin set off<br>rapidly into the darkness, the rest of us following.<br><br>It was still raining and intensely dark, but the wind had dropped. The mud<br>was unspeakable. The paths through the beet-fields were simply a succession of<br>lumps, as slippery as a greasy pole, with huge pools everywhere. Long before we<br>got <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the place where we were <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> leave our own parapet everyone had fallen<br>several times and our rifles were coated with mud. At the parapet a small knot<br>of men, our reserves, were waiting, and the doctor and a row of stretchers. We<br>filed through the gap in the parapet and waded through another irrigation ditch.<br>Splash-gurgle! Once again in water up <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> your waist, with the filthy, slimy mud<br>oozing over your boot-tops. On the grass outside Jorge waited till we were all<br>through. Then, bent almost double, he began creeping slowly forward. The Fascist<br>parapet was about a hundred and fifty yards away. Our one chance of getting<br>there was <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> move without noise.<br><br>I was in front with Jorge and Benjamin. Bent double, but with faces raised,<br>we crept into the almost utter darkness at a pace that grew slower at every<br>step. The rain beat lightly in our faces. When I glanced back I could see the<br>men who were nearest <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> me, a bunch of humped shapes like huge black mushrooms<br>gliding slowly forward. But every time I raised my head Benjamin, close beside<br>me, whispered fiercely in my ear: 'To keep ze head down! <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">To</B> keep ze head down!'<br>I could have told him that he needn't worry. I knew by experiment that on a dark<br>night you can never see a man at twenty paces. It was far more important <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> go<br>quietly. If they once heard us we were done <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B>  They had only <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> spray the<br>darkness with their machine-gun and there was nothing <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> it but <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> run or be<br>massacred.<br><br>But on the sodden ground it was almost impossible <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> move quietly. Do what<br>you would your feet stuck <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the mud, and every step you took was slop-slop,<br>slop-slop. And the devil of it was that the wind had dropped, and in spite of<br>the rain it was a very quiet night. Sounds would carry a long way. There was a<br>dreadful moment when I kicked against a tin and thought every Fascist within<br>miles must have heard it. But no, not a sound, no answering shot, no movement in<br>the Fascist lines. We crept onwards, always more slowly. I cannot convey <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> you<br>the depth of my desire <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> get there. Just <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> get within bombing distance before<br>they heard us! At such a time you have not even any fear, only a tremendous<br>hopeless longing <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> get over the intervening ground. I have felt exactly the<br>same thing when stalking a wild animal; the same agonized desire <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> get within<br>range, the same dreamlike certainty that it is impossible. And how the distance<br>stretched out! I knew the ground well, it was barely a hundred and fifty yards,<br>and yet it seemed more like a mile. When you are creeping at that pace you are<br>aware as an ant might be of the enormous variations in the ground; the splendid<br>patch of smooth grass here, the evil patch of sticky mud there, the tall<br>rustling reeds that have got <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> be avoided, the heap of stones that almost makes<br>you give up hope because it seems impossible <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> get over it without noise.<br><br>We had been creeping forward <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> such an age that I began <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> think we had<br>gone the wrong way. Then in the darkness thin parallel lines of something<br>blacker were faintly visible. It was the outer wire (the Fascists had two lines<br>of wire). Jorge knelt down, fumbled in his pocket. He had our only pair of<br>wire-cutters. Snip, snip. The trailing stuff was lifted delicately aside. We<br>waited <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> the men at the back <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> close up. They seemed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> be making a frightful<br>noise. It might be fifty yards <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the Fascist parapet now. Still onwards, bent<br>double. A stealthy step, lowering your foot as gently as a cat approaching a<br>mousehole; then a pause <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> listen; then another step. Once I raised my head; in<br>silence Benjamin put his hand behind my neck and pulled it violently down. I<br>knew that the inner wire was barely twenty yards from the parapet. It seemed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>me inconceivable that thirty men could get there unheard. Our breathing was<br>enough <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> give us away. Yet somehow we did get there. The Fascist parapet was<br>visible now, a dim black mound, looming high above us. Once again Jorge knelt<br>and fumbled. Snip, snip. There was no way of cutting the stuff silently.<br><br>So that was the inner wire. We crawled through it on all fours and rather<br>more rapidly. If we had time <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> deploy now all was well. Jorge and Benjamin<br>crawled across <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the right. But the men behind, who were spread out, had <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>form into single file <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> get through the narrow gap in the wire, and just as<br>this moment there was a flash and a bang from the Fascist parapet. The sentry<br>had heard us at last. Jorge poised himself on one knee and swung his arm like a<br>bowler. Crash! His bomb burst somewhere over the parapet. At once, far more<br>promptly than one would have thought possible, a roar of fire, ten or twenty<br>rifles, burst out from the Fascist parapet. They had been waiting <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> us after<br>all. Momentarily you could see every sand-bag in the lurid light. Men too far<br>back were flinging their bombs and some of them were falling short of the<br>parapet. Every loophole seemed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> be spouting jets of flame. It is always<br>hateful <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> be shot at in the dark--every rifle--flash seems <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> be pointed<br>straight at yourself--but it was the bombs that were the worst. You cannot<br>conceive the horror of these things till you have seen one burst close <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> you in<br>darkness; in the daytime there is only the crash of the explosion, in the<br>darkness there is the blinding red glare as well. I had flung myself down at the<br>first volley. All this while I was lying on my side in the greasy mud, wrestling<br>savagely with the pin of a bomb. The damned thing would not come out. Finally I<br>realized that I was twisting it in the wrong direction. I got the pin out, rose<br <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> my knees, hurled the bomb, and threw myself down again. The bomb burst over<br <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the right, outside the parapet; fright had spoiled my aim. Just at this<br>moment another bomb burst right in front of me, so close that I could feel the<br>heat of the explosion. I flattened myself out and dug my face into the mud so<br>hard that I hurt my neck and thought that I was wounded. Through the din I heard<br>an English voice behind me say quietly: 'I'm hit.' The bomb had, in fact,<br>wounded several people round about me without touching myself. I rose <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> my<br>knees and flung my second bomb. I forget where that one went.<br><br>The Fascists were firing, our people behind were firing, and I was very<br>conscious of being in the middle. I felt the blast of a shot and realized that a<br>man was firing from immediately behind me. I stood up and shouted at him:<br><br>'Don't shoot at me, you bloody fool!' At this moment I saw that Benjamin, ten<br>or fifteen yards <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> my right, was motioning <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> me with his arm. I ran across <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>him. It meant crossing the line of spouting loop-holes, and as I went I clapped<br>my left hand over my cheek; an idiotic gesture--as though one's hand could stop<br>a bullet!--but I had a horror of being hit in the face. Benjamin was kneeling<br>on one knee with a pleased, devilish sort of expression on his face and firing<br>carefully at the rifle-flashes with his automatic pistol. Jorge had dropped<br>wounded at the first volley and was somewhere out of sight. I knelt beside<br>Benjamin, pulled the pin out of my third bomb and flung it. Ah! No doubt about<br>it that time. The bomb crashed inside the parapet, at the corner, just by the<br>machine-gun nest.<br><br>The Fascist fire seemed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> have slackened very suddenly. Benjamin leapt <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>his feet and shouted: 'Forward! Charge!' We dashed up the short steep slope on<br>which the parapet stood. I say 'dashed'; 'lumbered' would be a better word; the<br>fact is that you can't move fast when you are sodden and mudded from head <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>foot and weighted down with a heavy rifle and bayonet and a hundred and fifty<br>cartridges. I took it <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> granted that there would be a Fascist waiting <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> me<br>at the top. If he fired at that range he could not miss me, and yet somehow I<br>never expected him <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> fire, only <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">try</B> <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> me with his bayonet. I seemed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>feel in advance the sensation of our bayonets crossing, and I wondered whether<br>his arm would be stronger than mine. However, there was no Fascist waiting. With<br>a vague feeling of relief I found that it was a low parapet and the sand-bags<br>gave a good foothold. As a rule they are difficult <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> get over. Everything<br>inside was smashed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> pieces, beams flung all over the place, and great shards<br>of uralite littered everywhere. Our bombs had wrecked all the huts and dug-outs.<br>And still there was not a soul visible. I thought they would be lurking<br>somewhere underground, and shouted in English (I could not think of any Spanish<br>at the moment): 'Come on out of it! Surrender!' No answer. Then a man, a shadowy<br>figure in the half-light, skipped over the roof of one of the ruined huts and<br>dashed away <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the left. I started after him, prodding my bayonet ineffectually<br>into the darkness. As I rounded the comer of the hut I saw a man--I don't know<br>whether or not it was the same man as I had seen before--fleeing up the<br>communication-trench that led <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the other Fascist position. I must have been<br>very close <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> him, <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> I could see him clearly. He was bareheaded and seemed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>have nothing on except a blanket which he was clutching round his shoulders. If<br>I had fired I could have blown him <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> pieces. But <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> fear of shooting one<br>another we had been ordered <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> use only bayonets once we were inside the<br>parapet, and in any case I never even thought of firing. Instead, my mind leapt<br>backwards twenty years, <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> our boxing instructor at school, showing me in vivid<br>pantomime how he had bayoneted a Turk at the Dardanelles. I gripped my rifle by<br>the small of the butt and lunged at the man's back. He was just out of my reach.<br>Another lunge: still out of reach. And <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> a little distance we proceeded like<br>this, he rushing up the trench and I after him on the ground above, prodding at<br>his shoulder-blades and never quite getting there--a comic memory <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> me <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>look back upon, though I suppose it seemed less comic <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> him.<br><br>Of course, he knew the ground better than I and had soon slipped away from<br>me. When I came back the position was full of shouting men. The noise of firing<br>had lessened somewhat. The Fascists were still pouring a heavy fire at us from<br>three sides, but it was coming from a greater distance.<br><br>We had driven them back <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> the time being. I remember saying in an oracular<br>manner: 'We can hold this place <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> half an hour, not more.' I don't know why I<br>picked on half an hour. Looking over the right-hand parapet you could see<br>innumerable greenish rifle-flashes stabbing the darkness; but they were a long<br>way back, a hundred or two hundred yards. Our job now was <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> search the position<br>and loot anything that was worth looting. Benjamin and some others were already<br>scrabbling among the ruins of a big hut or dug-out in the middle of the<br>position. Benjamin staggered excitedly through the ruined roof, tugging at the<br>rope handle of an ammunition box.<br><br>'Comrades! Ammunition! Plenty ammunition here!'<br><br>'We don't want ammunition,' said a voice, 'we want rifles.'<br><br>This was true. Half our rifles were jammed with mud and unusable. They could<br>be cleaned, but it is dangerous <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> take the bolt out of a rifle in the darkness;<br>you put it down somewhere and then you lose it. I had a tiny electric torch<br>which my wife had managed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> buy in Barcelona, otherwise we had no light of any<br>description between us. A few men with good rifles began a desultory fire at the<br>flashes in the distance. No one dared fire too rapidly; even the best of the<br>rifles were liable <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> jam if they got too hot. There were about sixteen of us<br>inside the parapet, including one or two who were wounded. A number of wounded,<br>English and Spanish, were lying outside. Patrick O'Hara, a Belfast Irishman who<br>had had some training in first-aid, went <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> and fro with packets of bandages,<br>binding up the wounded men and, of course, being shot at every time he returned<br <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the parapet, in spite of his indignant shouts of 'Poum!'<br><br>We began searching the position. There were several dead men lying about, but<br>I did not stop <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> examine them. The thing I was after was the machine-gun. All<br>the while when we were lying outside I had been wondering vaguely why the gun<br>did not fire. I flashed my torch inside the machine-gun nest. A bitter<br>disappointment! The gun was not there. Its tripod was there, and various boxes<br>of ammunition and spare parts, but the gun was gone. They must have unscrewed it<br>and carried it off at the first alarm. No doubt they were acting under orders,<br>but it was a stupid and cowardly thing <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> do, <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> if they had kept the gun in<br>place they could have slaughtered the whole lot of us. We were furious. We had<br>set our hearts on capturing a machine-gun.<br><br>We poked here and there but did not find anything of much value. There were<br>quantities of Fascist bombs lying about--a rather inferior type of bomb, which<br>you touched off by pulling a string--and I put a couple of them in my pocket as<br>souvenirs. It was impossible not <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> be struck by the bare misery of the Fascist<br>dug-outs. The litter of spare clothes, books, food, petty personal belongings<br>that you saw in our own dug-outs was completely absent; these poor unpaid<br>conscripts seemed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> own nothing except blankets and a few soggy hunks of bread.<br>Up at the far end there was a small dug-out which was partly above ground and<br>had a tiny window. We flashed the torch through the window and instantly raised<br>a cheer. A cylindrical object in a leather case, four feet high and six inches<br>in diameter, was leaning against the wall. Obviously the machine-gun barrel. We<br>dashed round and got in at the doorway, <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> find that the thing in the leather<br>case was not a machine-gun but something which, in our weapon-starved army, was<br>even more precious. It was an enormous telescope, probably of at least sixty or<br>seventy magnifications, with a folding tripod. Such telescopes simply did not<br>exist on our side of the line and they were desperately needed. We brought it<br>out in triumph and leaned it against the parapet, <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> be carried off after.<br><br>At this moment someone shouted that the Fascists were closing in. Certainly<br>the din of firing had grown very much louder. But it was <B style="color:black;background-color:#99FFCC">obvious</B> that the<br>Fascists would not counter-attack from the right, which meant crossing no man's<br>land and assaulting their own parapet. If they had any sense at all they would<br>come at us from inside the line. I went round <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the other side of the dug-outs.<br>The position was roughly horseshoe-shaped, with the dug-outs in the middle, so<br>that we had another parapet covering us on the left. A heavy fire was coming<br>from that direction, but it did not matter greatly. The danger-spot was straight<br>in front, where there was no protection at all. A stream of bullets was passing<br>just overhead. They must be coming from the other Fascist position farther up<br>the line; evidently the Shock Troopers had not captured it after all. But this<br>time the noise was deafening. It was the unbroken, drum-like roar of massed<br>rifles which I was used <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> hearing from a little distance; this was the first<br>time I had been in the middle of it. And by now, of course, the firing had<br>spread along the line <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> miles around. Douglas Thompson, with a wounded arm<br>dangling useless at his side, was leaning against the parapet and firing<br>one-handed at the flashes. Someone whose rifle had jammed was loading <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> <br>him.<br><br>There were four or five of us round this side. It was <B style="color:black;background-color:#99FFCC">obvious</B> what we must<br>do. We must drag the sand-bags from the front parapet and make a barricade<br>across the unprotected side. And we had got <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> be quick. The fire was high at<br>present, but they might lower it at any moment; by the flashes all round I could<br>see that we had a hundred or two hundred men against us. We began wrenching the<br>sand-bags loose, carrying them twenty yards forward and dumping them into a<br>rough heap. It was a vile job. They were big sand-bags, weighing a hundredweight<br>each and it took every ounce of your strength <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> prise them loose; and then the<br>rotten sacking split and the damp earth cascaded all over you, down your neck<br>and up your sleeves. I remember feeling a deep horror at everything: the chaos,<br>the darkness, the frightful din, the slithering <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> and fro in the mud, the<br>struggles with the bursting sand-bags--all the time encumbered with my rifle,<br>which I dared not put down <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> fear of losing it. I even shouted <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> someone as<br>we staggered along with a bag between us: 'This is war! Isn't it bloody?'<br>Suddenly a succession of tall figures came leaping over the front parapet. As<br>they came nearer we saw that they wore the uniform of the Shock Troopers, and we<br>cheered, thinking they were reinforcements. However, there were only four of<br>them, three Germans and a Spaniard.<br><br>We heard afterwards what had happened <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the Shock Troopers. They did not<br>know the ground and in the darkness had been led <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the wrong place, where they<br>were caught on the Fascist wire and numbers of them were shot down. These were<br>four who had got lost, luckily <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> themselves. The Germans did not speak a word<br>of English, French, or Spanish. With difficulty and much gesticulation we<br>explained what we were doing and got them <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> help us in building the<br>barricade.<br><br>The Fascists had brought up a machine-gun now. You could see it spitting like<br>a squib a hundred or two hundred yards away; the bullets came over us with a<br>steady, frosty crackle. Before long we had flung enough sand-bags into place <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>make a low breastwork behind which the few men who were on this side of the<br>position could lie down and fire. I was kneeling behind them. A mortar-shell<br>whizzed over and crashed somewhere in no man's land. That was another danger,<br>but it would take them some minutes <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> find our range. Now that we had finished<br>wrestling with those beastly sand-bags it was not bad fun in a way; the noise,<br>the darkness, the flashes approaching, our own men blazing back at the flashes.<br>One even had time <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> think a little. I remember wondering whether I was<br>frightened, and deciding that I was not. Outside, where I was probably in less<br>danger, I had been half sick with fright. Suddenly there was another shout that<br>the Fascists were closing in. There was no doubt about it this time, the<br>rifle-flashes were much nearer. I saw a flash hardly twenty yards away.<br>Obviously they were working their way up the communication-trench. At twenty<br>yards they were within easy bombing range; there were eight or nine of us<br>bunched together and a single well-placed bomb would blow us all <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> fragments.<br>Bob Smillie, the blood running down his face from a small wound, sprang <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> his<br>knee and flung a bomb. We cowered, waiting <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> the crash. The fuse fizzled red<br>as it sailed through the air, but the bomb failed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> explode. (At least a<br>quarter of these bombs were duds'). I had no bombs left except the Fascist ones<br>and I was not certain how these worked. I shouted <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the others <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> know if<br>anyone had a bomb <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> spare. Douglas Moyle felt in his pocket and passed one<br>across. I flung it and threw myself on my face. By one of those strokes of luck<br>that happen about once in a year I had managed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> drop the bomb almost exactly<br>where the rifle had flashed. There was the roar of the explosion and then,<br>instantly, a diabolical outcry of screams and groans. We had got one of them,<br>anyway; I don't know whether he was killed, but certainly he was badly hurt.<br>Poor wretch, poor wretch! I felt a vague sorrow as I heard him screaming. But at<br>the same instant, in the dim light of the rifle-flashes, I saw or thought I saw<br>a figure standing near the place where the rifle had flashed. I threw up my<br>rifle and let fly. Another scream, but I think it was still the effect of the<br>bomb. Several more bombs were thrown. The next rifle-flashes we saw were a long<br>way off, a hundred yards or more. So we had driven them back, temporarily at<br>least.<br><br>Everyone began cursing and saying why the hell didn't they send us some<br>supports. With a sub-machine-gun or twenty men with clean rifles we could hold<br>this place against a battalion. At this moment Paddy Donovan, who was<br>second-in-command <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> Benjamin and had been sent back <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> orders, climbed over<br>the front parapet.<br><br>'Hi! Come on out of it! All men <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> retire at once!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Retire! Get out of it!'<br><br>'Why?'<br><br>'Orders. Back <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> our own lines double-quick.'<br><br>People were already climbing over the front parapet. Several of them were<br>struggling with a heavy ammunition box. My mind flew <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the telescope which I<br>had left leaning against the parapet on the other side of the position. But at<br>this moment I saw that the four Shock Troopers, acting I suppose on some<br>mysterious orders they had received beforehand, had begun running up the<br>communication-trench. It led <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the other Fascist position and--if they got<br>there--to certain death. They were disappearing into the darkness. I ran after<br>them, trying <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> think of the Spanish <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> 'retire'; finally I shouted, 'Atras!<br>Atras!' which perhaps conveyed the right meaning. The Spaniard understood it and<br>brought the others back. Paddy was waiting at the parapet.<br><br>'Come on, hurry up.'<br><br>'But the telescope!'<br><br>'B--the telescope! Benjamin's waiting outside.'<br><br>We climbed out. Paddy held the wire aside <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> me. As soon as we got away from<br>the shelter of the Fascist parapet we were under a devilish fire that seemed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>be coming at us from every direction. Part of it, I do not doubt, came from our<br>own side, <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> everyone was firing all along the line. Whichever way we turned a<br>fresh stream of bullets swept past; we were driven this way and that in the<br>darkness like a flock of sheep. It did not make it any easier that we were<br>dragging a captured box of ammunition--one of those boxes that hold 1750 rounds<br>and weigh about a hundredweight--besides a box of bombs and several Fascist<br>rifles. In a few minutes, although the distance from parapet <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> parapet was not<br>two hundred yards and most of us knew the ground, we were completely lost. We<br>found ourselves slithering about in a muddy field, knowing nothing except that<br>bullets were coming from both sides. There was no moon <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> go by, but the sky was<br>growing a little lighter. Our lines lay east of Huesca; I wanted <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> stay where we<br>were till the first crack of dawn showed us which was east and which was west;<br>but the others were against it. We slithered onwards, changing our direction<br>several times and taking it in turns <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> haul at the ammunition-box. At last we<br>saw the low flat line of a parapet looming in front of us. It might be ours or<br>it might be the Fascists'; nobody had the dimmest idea which way we were going.<br>Benjamin crawled on his belly through some tall whitish weed till he was about<br>twenty yards from the parapet and tried a challenge. A shout of 'Poum!' answered<br>him. We jumped <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> our feet, found our way along the parapet, slopped once more<br>through the irrigation ditch--splash-gurgle!--and were in safety.<br><br>Kopp was waiting inside the parapet with a few Spaniards. The doctor and the<br>stretchers were gone. It appeared that all the wounded had been got in except<br>Jorge and one of our own men, Hiddlestone by name, who were missing. Kopp was<br>pacing up and down, very pale. Even the fat folds at the back of his neck were<br>pale; he was paying no attention <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the bullets that streamed over the low<br>parapet and cracked close <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> his head. Most of us were squatting behind the<br>parapet <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> cover. Kopp was muttering. 'Jorge! Cogno! Jorge!' And then in<br>English. 'If Jorge is gone it is terreeble, terreeble!' Jorge was his personal<br>friend and one of his best officers. Suddenly he turned <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> us and asked <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> five<br>volunteers, two English and three Spanish, <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> go and look <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> the missing men.<br>Moyle and I volunteered with three Spaniards.<br><br>As we got outside the Spaniards murmured that it was getting dangerously<br>light. This was true enough; the sky was dimly blue. There was a tremendous<br>noise of excited voices coming from the Fascist redoubt. Evidently they had<br>re-occupied the place in much greater force than before. We were sixty or<br>seventy yards from the parapet when they must have seen or heard us, <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> they<br>sent over a heavy burst of fire which made us drop on our faces. One of them<br>flung a bomb over the parapet--a sure sign of panic. We were lying in the<br>grass, waiting <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> an opportunity <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> move on, when we heard or thought we heard<br>--I have no doubt it was pure imagination, but it seemed real enough at the time<br>--that the Fascist voices were much closer. They had left the parapet and were<br>coming after us. 'Run!' I yelled <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> Moyle, and jumped <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> my feet. And heavens,<br>how I ran! I had thought earlier in the night that you can't run when you are<br>sodden from head <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> foot and weighted down with a rifle and cartridges; I<br>learned now you can always run when you think you have fifty or a hundred armed<br>men after you. But if I could run fast, others could run faster. In my flight<br>something that might have been a shower of meteors sped past me. It was the<br>three Spaniards, who had been in front. They were back <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> our own parapet before<br>they stopped and I could catch up with them. The truth was that our nerves were<br>all <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> pieces. I knew, however, that in a half light one man is invisible where<br>five are clearly visible, so I went back alone. I managed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> get <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the outer<br>wire and searched the ground as well as I could, which was not very well, <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> I<br>had <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> lie on my belly. There was no sign of Jorge or Hiddlestone, so I crept<br>back. We learned afterwards that both Jorge and Hiddlestone had been taken <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> <br>the dressing-station earlier. Jorge was lightly wounded through the shoulder.<br>Hiddlestone had received a dreadful wound--a bullet which travelled right up<br>his left arm, breaking the bone in several places; as he lay helpless on the<br>ground a bomb had burst near him and torn various other parts of his body. He<br>recovered, I am glad <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> say. Later he told me that he had worked his way some<br>distance lying on his back, then had clutched hold of a wounded Spaniard and<br>they had helped one another in.<br><br>It was getting light now. Along the line <B style="color:black;background-color:#CCCC00">for</B> miles around a ragged<br>meaningless fire was thundering, like the rain that goes on raining after a<br>storm. I remember the desolate look of everything, the morasses of mud, the<br>weeping poplar trees, the yellow water in the trench-bottoms; and men's<br>exhausted faces, unshaven, streaked with mud, and blackened <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> the eyes with<br>smoke. When I got back <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> my dug--out the three men I shared it with were<br>already fast sleep. They had flung themselves down with all their equipment on<br>and their muddy rifles clutched against them. Everything was sodden, inside the<br>dug--out as well as outside. By long searching I managed <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> collect enough chips<br>of dry wood <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> make a tiny fire. Then I smoked the cigar which I had been<br>hoarding and which, surprisingly enough, had not got broken during the<br>night.<br><br>Afterwards we learned that the action had been a success, as such things go.<br>It was merely a raid <B style="color:black;background-color:#9999CC">to</B> make the Fascists divert troops from the other side of<br>Huesca, where the Anarchists were attacking again. I had judged that the<br>Fascists had thrown a hundred or two hundred men into the counter-attack, but a<br>deserter told us later on that it was six hundred.
