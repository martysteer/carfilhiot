<h2>Chapter 6</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br><br>MEANWHILE, the daily--more particularly nightly--round, the common task.<br>Sentry-go, patrols, digging; mud, rain, shrieking winds, and occasional snow. It<br>was not till well into April that the nights grew noticeably warmer. Up here on<br>the plateau the March days were mostly like an English March, with bright blue<br>skies and nagging winds. The winter barley was a foot high, crimson buds were<br>forming on the cherry trees (the line here ran through deserted orchards and<br>vegetable gardens), and if you searched the ditches you could find violets and a<br>kind of wild hyacinth like a poor specimen of a bluebell. Immediately behind the<br>line there ran a wonderful, green, bubbling stream, the first transparent water<br>I had seen since coming to the front. One day I set my teeth and crawled into<br>the river to have my first bath in six weeks. It was what you might call a brief<br>bath, for the water was mainly snow-water and not much above freezing-point.<br><br>Meanwhile nothing happened, nothing ever happened. The English had got into<br>the habit of saying that this wasn't a war, it was a bloody pantomime. We were<br>hardly under direct fire from the Fascists. The only danger was from stray<br>bullets, which, as the lines curved forward on either side, came from several<br>directions. All the casualties at this time were from strays. Arthur Clinton got<br>a mysterious bullet that smashed his left shoulder and disabled his arm,<br>permanently, I am afraid. There was a little shell-fire, but it was<br>extraordinarily ineffectual. The scream and crash of the shells was actually<br>looked upon as a mild diversion. The Fascists never dropped their shells on our<br>parapet. A few hundred yards behind us there was a country house, called La<br>Granja, with big farm-buildings, which was used as a store, headquarters, and<br>cook-house for this sector of the line. It was this that the Fascist gunners<br>were trying for, but they were five or six kilometres away and they never aimed<br>well enough to do more than smash the windows and chip the walls. You were only<br>in danger if you happened to be coming up the road when the firing started, and<br>the shells plunged into the fields on either side of you. One learned almost<br>immediately the mysterious art of knowing by the sound of a shell how close it<br>will fall. The shells the Fascists were firing at this period were wretchedly<br>bad. Although they were 150 mm. they only made a crater about six feet wide by<br>four deep, and at least one in four failed to explode. There were the usual<br>romantic tales of sabotage in the Fascist factories and unexploded shells in<br>which, instead of the charge, there was found a scrap of paper saying 'Red<br>Front', but I never saw one. The truth was that the shells were hopelessly old;<br>someone picked up a brass fuse-cap stamped with the date, and it was 1917. The<br>Fascist guns were of the same make and calibre as our own, and the unexploded<br>shells were often reconditioned and fired back. There was said to be one old<br>shell with a nickname of its own which travelled daily to and fro, never<br>exploding.<br><br>At night small patrols used to be sent into no man's land to lie in ditches<br>near the Fascist lines and listen for sounds (bugle-calls, motor-horns, and so<br>forth) that indicated activity in Huesca. There was a constant come-and-go of<br>Fascist troops, and the numbers could be checked to some extent from listeners'<br>reports. We always had special orders to report the ringing of church bells. It<br>seemed that the Fascists always heard mass before going into action. In among<br>the fields and orchards there were deserted mud-walled huts which it was safe to<br>explore with a lighted match when you had plugged up the windows. Sometimes you<br>came on valuable pieces of loot such as a hatchet or a Fascist water-bottle<br>(better than ours and greatly sought after). You could explore in the daytime as<br>well, but mostly it had to be done crawling on all fours. It was queer to creep<br>about in those empty, fertile fields where everything had been arrested just at<br>the harvest-moment. Last year's crops had never been touched. The unpruned vines<br>were snaking across the ground, the cobs on the standing maize had gone as hard<br>as stone, the mangels and sugar-beets were hyper--trophied into huge woody<br>lumps. How the peasants must have cursed both armies! Sometimes parties of men<br>went spud-gathering in no man's land. About a mile to the right of us, where the<br>lines were closer together, there was a patch of potatoes that was frequented<br>both by the Fascists and ourselves. We went there in the daytime, they only at<br>night, as it was commanded by our machine-guns. One night to our annoyance they<br>turned out en masse and cleared up the whole patch. We discovered another patch<br>farther on, where there was practically no cover and you had to lift the<br>potatoes lying on your belly--a fatiguing job. If their machine-gunners spotted<br>you, you had to flatten yourself out like a rat when it squirms under a door,<br>with the bullets cutting up the clods a few yards behind you. It seemed worth it<br>at the time. Potatoes were getting very scarce. If you got a sackful you could<br>take them down to the cook-house and swap them for a water-bottleful of<br>coffee.<br><br>And still nothing happened, nothing ever looked like happening. 'When are we<br>going to attack? Why don't we attack?' were the questions you heard night and<br>day from Spaniard and Englishman alike. When you think what fighting means it is<br>queer that soldiers want to fight, and yet undoubtedly they do. In stationary<br>warfare there are three things that all soldiers long for: a battle, more<br>cigarettes, and a week's leave. We were somewhat better armed now than before.<br>Each man had a hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition instead of fifty, and by<br>degrees we were being issued with bayonets, steel helmets, and a few bombs.<br>There were constant rumours of forthcoming battles, which I have since thought<br>were deliberately circulated to keep up the spirits of the troops. It did not<br>need much military knowledge to see that there would be no major action on this<br>side of Huesca, at any rate for the time being. The strategic point was the road<br>to Jaca, over on the other side. Later, when the Anarchists made their attacks<br>on the Jaca road, our job was to make 'holding attacks' and force the Fascists<br>to divert troops from the other side.<br><br>During all this time, about six weeks, there was only one action on our part<br>of the front. This was when our Shock Troopers attacked the Manicomio, a disused<br>lunatic asylum which the Fascists had converted into a fortress. There were<br>several hundred refugee Germans serving with the P.O.U.M. They were organized in<br>a special battalion called the Batallon de Cheque, and from a military point of<br>view they were on quite a different level from the rest of the militia--indeed,<br>were more like soldiers than anyone I saw in Spain, except the Assault Guards<br>and some of the International Column. The attack was mucked up, as usual. How<br>many operations in this war, on the Government side, were not mucked up, I<br>wonder? The Shock Troops took the Manicomio by storm, but the troops, of I<br>forget which militia, who were to support them by seizing the neighbouring hill<br>that commanded the Manicomio, were badly let down. The captain who led them was<br>one of those Regular Army officers of doubtful loyalty whom the Government<br>persisted in employing. Either from fright or treachery he warned the Fascists<br>by flinging a bomb when they were two hundred yards away. I am glad to say his<br>men shot him dead on the spot. But the surprise-attack was no surprise, and the<br>militiamen were mown down by heavy fire and driven off the hill, and at<br>nightfall the Shock Troops had to abandon the Manicomio. Through the night the<br>ambulances filed down the abominable road to Sietamo, killing the badly wounded<br>with their joltings.<br><br>All of us were lousy by this time; though still cold it was warm enough for<br>that. I have had a big experience of body vermin of various kinds, and for sheer<br>beastliness the louse beats everything I have encountered. Other insects,<br>mosquitoes for instance, make you suffer more, but at least they aren't resident<br>vermin. The human louse somewhat resembles a tiny lobster, and he lives chiefly<br>in your trousers. Short of burning all your clothes there is no known way of<br>getting rid of him. Down the seams of your trousers he lays his glittering white<br>eggs, like tiny grains of rice, which hatch out and breed families of their own<br>at horrible speed. I think the pacifists might find it helpful to illustrate<br>their pamphlets with enlarged photographs of lice. Glory of war, indeed! In war<br>all soldiers are lousy, at least when it is warm enough. The men who fought at<br>Verdun, at Waterloo, at Flodden, at Senlac, at Thermopylae--every one of them<br>had lice crawling over his testicles. We kept the brutes down to some extent by<br>burning out the eggs and by bathing as often as we could face it. Nothing short<br>of lice could have driven me into that ice-cold river.<br><br>Everything was running short--boots, clothes, tobacco, soap, candles,<br>matches, olive oil. Our uniforms were dropping to pieces, and many of the men<br>had no boots, only rope-soled sandals. You came on piles of worn-out boots<br>everywhere. Once we kept a dug-out fire burning for two days mainly with boots,<br>which are not bad fuel. By this time my wife was in Barcelona and used to send<br>me tea, chocolate, and even cigars when such things were procurable, but even in<br>Barcelona everything was running short, especially tobacco. The tea was a<br>godsend, though we had no milk and seldom any sugar. Parcels were constantly<br>being sent from England to men in the contingent but they never arrived; food,<br>clothes, cigarettes--everything was either refused by the Post Office or seized<br>in France. Curiously enough, the only firm that succeeded in sending packets of<br>tea--even, on one memorable occasion, a tin of biscuits--to my wife was the<br>Army and Navy Stores. Poor old Army and Navy! They did their duty nobly, but<br>perhaps they might have felt happier if the stuff had been going to Franco's<br>side of the barricade. The shortage of tobacco was the worst of all. At the<br>beginning we had been issued with a packet of cigarettes a day, then it got down<br>to eight cigarettes a day, then to five. Finally there were ten deadly days when<br>there was no issue of tobacco at all. For the first time, in Spain, I saw<br>something that you see every day in London--people picking up fag-ends.<br><br>Towards the end of March I got a poisoned hand that had to be lanced and put<br>in a sling. I had to go into hospital, but it was not worth sending me to<br>Sietamo for such a petty injury, so I stayed in the so--called hospital at<br>Monflorite, which was merely a casualty clearing station. I was there ten days,<br>part of the time in bed. The practicantes (hospital assistants) stole<br>practically every valuable object I possessed, including my camera and all my<br>photographs. At the front everyone stole, it was the inevitable effect of<br>shortage, but the hospital people were always the worst. Later, in the hospital<br>at Barcelona, an American who had come to join the International Column on a<br>ship that was torpedoed by an Italian submarine, told me how he was carried<br>ashore wounded, and how, even as they lifted him into the ambulance, the<br>stretcher-bearers pinched his wrist-watch.<br><br>While my arm was in the sling I spent several blissful days wandering about<br>the country-side. Monflorite was the usual huddle of mud and stone houses, with<br>narrow tortuous alleys that had been churned by lorries till they looked like<br>the craters of the moon. The church had been badly knocked about but was used as<br>a military store. In the whole neighbourhood there were only two farm-houses of<br>any size, Torre Lorenzo and Torre Fabian, and only two really large buildings,<br>obviously the houses of the landowners who had once lorded it over the<br>countryside; you could see their wealth reflected in the miserable huts of the<br>peasants. Just behind the river, close to the front line, there was an enormous<br>flour-mill with a country-house attached to it. It seemed shameful to see the<br>huge costly machine rusting useless and the wooden flour-chutes torn down for<br>firewood. Later on, to get firewood for the troops farther back, parties of men<br>were sent in lorries to wreck the place systematically. They used to smash the<br>floorboards of a room by bursting a hand-grenade in it. La Granja, our store and<br>cook-house, had possibly at one time been a convent. It had huge courtyards and<br>out-houses, covering an acre or more, with stabling for thirty or forty horses.<br>The country-houses in that part of Spain are of no interest architecturally, but<br>their farm-buildings, of lime-washed stone with round arches and magnificent<br>roof-beams, are noble places, built on a plan that has probably not altered for<br>centuries. Sometimes it gave you a sneaking sympathy with the Fascist ex-owners<br>to see the way the militia treated the buildings they had seized. In La Granja<br>every room that was not in use had been turned into a latrine--a frightful<br>shambles of smashed furniture and excrement. The little church that adjoined it,<br>its walls perforated by shell-holes, had its floor inches deep in dung. In the<br>great courtyard where the cooks ladled out the rations the litter of rusty tins,<br>mud, mule dung, and decaying food was revolting. It gave point to the old army<br>song:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rats, rats,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rats as big as cats,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quartermaster's store!<br><br>The ones at La Granja itself really were as big as cats, or nearly; great<br>bloated brutes that waddled over the beds of muck, too impudent even to run away<br>unless you shot at them.<br><br>Spring was really here at last. The blue in the sky was softer, the air grew<br>suddenly balmy. The frogs were mating noisily in the ditches. Round the<br>drinking-pool that served for the village mules I found exquisite green frogs<br>the size of a penny, so brilliant that the young grass looked dull beside them.<br>Peasant lads went out with buckets hunting for snails, which they roasted alive<br>on sheets of tin. As soon as the weather improved the peasants had turned out<br>for the spring ploughing. It is typical of the utter vagueness in which the<br>Spanish agrarian revolution is wrapped that I could not even discover for<br>certain whether the land here was collectivized or whether the peasants had<br>simply divided it up among themselves. I fancy that in theory it was<br>collectivized, this being P.O.U.M. and Anarchist territory. At any rate the<br>landowners were gone, the fields were being cultivated, and people seemed<br>satisfied. The friendliness of the peasants towards ourselves never ceased to<br>astonish me. To some of the older ones the war must have seemed meaningless,<br>visibly it produced a shortage of everything and a dismal dull life for<br>everybody, and at the best of times peasants hate having troops quartered upon<br>them. Yet they were invariably friendly--I suppose reflecting that, however<br>intolerable we might be in other ways, we did stand between them and their<br>one-time landlords. Civil war is a queer thing. Huesca was not five miles away,<br>it was these people's market town, all of them had relatives there, every week<br>of their lives they had gone there to sell their poultry and vegetables. And now<br>for eight months an impenetrable barrier of barbed wire and machine-guns had<br>lain between. Occasionally it slipped their memory. Once I was talking to an old<br>woman who was carrying one of those tiny iron lamps in which the Spaniards bum<br>olive oil. 'Where can I buy a lamp like that?' I said.' In Huesca,' she said<br>without thinking, and then we both laughed. The village girls were splendid<br>vivid creatures with coal-black hair, a swinging walk, and a straightforward,<br>man-to-man demeanour which was probably a by-product of the revolution.<br><br>Men in ragged blue shirts and black corduroy breeches, with broad--brimmed<br>straw hats, were ploughing the fields behind teams of mules with rhythmically<br>flopping ears. Their ploughs were wretched things, only stirring the soil, not<br>cutting anything we should regard as a furrow. All the agricultural implements<br>were pitifully antiquated, everything being governed by the expensiveness of<br>metal. A broken ploughshare, for instance, was patched, and then patched again,<br>till sometimes it was mainly patches. Rakes and pitchforks were made of wood.<br>Spades, among a people who seldom possessed boots, were unknown; they did their<br>digging with a clumsy hoe like those used in India. There was a kind of harrow<br>that took one straight back to the later Stone Age. It was made of boards joined<br>together, to about the size of a kitchen table; in the boards hundreds of holes<br>were morticed, and into each hole was jammed a piece of flint which had been<br>chipped into shape exactly as men used to chip them ten thousand years ago. I<br>remember my feelings almost of horror when I first came upon one of these things<br>in a derelict hut in no man's land. I had to puzzle over it for a long while<br>before grasping that it was a harrow. It made me sick to think of the work that<br>must go into the making of such a thing, and the poverty that was obliged to use<br>flint in place of steel. I have felt more kindly towards industrialism ever<br>since. But in the village there were two up-to-date farm tractors, no doubt<br>seized from some big landowner's estate.<br><br>Once or twice I wandered out to the little walled graveyard that stood a mile<br>or so from the village. The dead from the front were normally sent to Sietamo;<br>these were the village dead. It was queerly different from an English graveyard.<br>No reverence for the dead here! Everything overgrown with bushes and coarse<br>grass, human bones littered everywhere. But the really surprising thing was the<br>almost complete lack of religious inscriptions on the gravestones, though they<br>all dated from before the revolution. Only once, I think, I saw the 'Pray for<br>the Soul of So-and-So' which is usual on Catholic graves. Most of the<br>inscriptions were purely secular, with ludicrous poems about the virtues of the<br>deceased. On perhaps one grave in four or five there was a small cross or a<br>perfunctory reference to Heaven; this had usually been chipped off by some<br>industrious atheist with a chisel.<br><br>It struck me that the people in this part of Spain must be genuinely without<br>religious feeling--religious feeling, I mean, in the orthodox sense. It is<br>curious that all the time I was in Spain I never once saw a person cross<br>himself; yet you would think such a movement would become instinctive,<br>revolution or no revolution. Obviously the Spanish Church will come back (as the<br>saying goes, night and the Jesuits always return), but there is no doubt that at<br>the outbreak of the revolution it collapsed and was smashed up to an extent that<br>would be unthinkable even for the moribund C. of E. in like circumstances. To<br>the Spanish people, at any rate in Catalonia and Aragon, the Church was a racket<br>pure and simple. And possibly Christian belief was replaced to some extent by<br>Anarchism, whose influence is widely spread and which undoubtedly has a<br>religious tinge.<br><br>It was the day I came back from hospital that we advanced the line to what<br>was really its proper position, about a thousand yards forward, along the little<br>stream that lay a couple of hundred yards in front of the Fascist line. This<br>operation ought to have been carried out months earlier. The point of doing it<br>now was that the Anarchists were attacking on the Jaca road, and to advance on<br>this side made them divert troops to face us.<br><br>We were sixty or seventy hours without sleep, and my memories go down into a<br>sort of blue, or rather a series of pictures. Listening-duty in no man's land, a<br>hundred yards from the Casa Francesa, a fortified farm-house which was part of<br>the Fascist line. Seven hours lying in a horrible marsh, in reedy-smelling water<br>into which one's body subsided gradually deeper and deeper: the reedy smell, the<br>numbing cold, the stars immovable in the black sky, the harsh croaking of the<br>frogs. Though this was April it was the coldest night that I remember in Spain.<br>Only a hundred yards behind us the working-parties were hard at it, but there<br>was utter silence except for the chorus of the frogs. Just once during the night<br>I heard a sound--the familiar noise of a sand-bag being flattened with a spade.<br>It is queer how, just now and again, Spaniards can carry out a brilliant feat of<br>organization. The whole move was beautifully planned. In seven hours six hundred<br>men constructed twelve hundred metres of trench and parapet, at distances of<br>from a hundred and fifty to three hundred yards from the Fascist line, and all<br>so silently that the Fascists heard nothing, and during the night there was only<br>one casualty. There were more next day, of course. Every man had his job<br>assigned to him, even to the cook-house orderlies who suddenly arrived when the<br>work was done with buckets of wine laced with brandy.<br><br>And then the dawn coming up and the Fascists suddenly discovering that we<br>were there. The square white block of the Casa Francesa, though it was two<br>hundred yards away, seemed to tower over us, and the machine--guns in its<br>sandbagged upper windows seemed to be pointing straight down into the trench. We<br>all stood gaping at it, wondering why the Fascists didn't see us. Then a vicious<br>swirl of bullets, and everyone had flung himself on his knees and was<br>frantically digging, deepening the trench and scooping out small shelters in the<br>side. My arm was still in bandages, I could not dig, and I spent most of that<br>day reading a detective story--The Missing Money-lender its name was. I don't<br>remember the plot of it, but I remember very clearly the feeling of sitting<br>there reading it; the dampish clay of the trench bottom underneath me, the<br>constant shifting of my legs out of the way as men hurried stopping down the<br>trench, the crack-crack-crack of bullets a foot or two overhead. Thomas Parker<br>got a bullet through the top of his thigh, which, as he said, was nearer to<br>being a D.S.O. than he cared about. Casualties were happening all along the<br>line, but nothing to what there would have been if they had caught us on the<br>move during the night. A deserter told us afterwards that five Fascist sentries<br>were shot for negligence. Even now they could have massacred us if they had had<br>the initiative to bring up a few mortars. It was an awkward job getting the<br>wounded down the narrow, crowded trench. I saw one poor devil, his breeches dark<br>with blood, flung out of his stretcher and gasping in agony. One had to carry<br>wounded men a long distance, a mile or more, for even when a road existed the<br>ambulances never came very near the front line. If they came too near the<br>Fascists had a habit of shelling them--justifiably, for in modern war no one<br>scruples to use an ambulance for carrying ammunition.<br><br>And then, next night, waiting at Torre Fabian for an attack that was called<br>off at the last moment by wireless. In the barn where we waited the floor was a<br>thin layer of chaff over deep beds of bones, human bones and cows' bones mixed<br>up, and the place was alive with rats. The filthy brutes came swarming out of<br>the ground on every side. If there is one thing I hate more than another it is a<br>rat running over me in the darkness. However, I had the satisfaction of catching<br>one of them a good punch that sent him flying.<br><br>And then waiting fifty or sixty yards from the Fascist parapet for the order<br>to attack. A long line of men crouching in an irrigation ditch with their<br>bayonets peeping over the edge and the whites of their eyes shining through the<br>darkness. Kopp and Benjamin squatting behind us with a man who had a wireless<br>receiving-box strapped to his shoulders. On the western horizon rosy gun-flashes<br>followed at intervals of several seconds by enormous explosions. And then a<br>pip-pip-pip noise from the wireless and the whispered order that we were to get<br>out of it while the going was good. We did so, but not quickly enough. Twelve<br>wretched children of the J.C.I. (the Youth League of the P.O.U.M., corresponding<br>to the J.S.U. of the P.S.U.C.) who had been posted only about forty yards from<br>the Fascist parapet, were caught by the dawn and unable to escape. All day they<br>had to lie there, with only tufts of grass for cover, the Fascists shooting at<br>them every time they moved. By nightfall seven were dead, then the other five<br>managed to creep away in the darkness.<br><br>And then, for many mornings to follow, the sound of the Anarchist attacks on<br>the other side of Huesca. Always the same sound. Suddenly, at some time in the<br>small hours, the opening crash of several score bombs bursting simultaneously--<br>even from miles away a diabolical, rending crash--and then the unbroken roar of<br>massed rifles and machine-guns, a heavy rolling sound curiously similar to the<br>roll of drums. By degrees the firing would spread all round the lines that<br>encircled Huesca, and we would stumble out into the trench to lean sleepily<br>against the parapet while a ragged meaningless fire swept overhead.<br><br>In the daytime the guns thundered fitfully. Torre Fabian, now our cookhouse,<br>was shelled and partially destroyed. It is curious that when you are watching<br>artillery-fire from a safe distance you always want the gunner to hit his mark,<br>even though the mark contains your dinner and some of your comrades. The<br>Fascists were shooting well that morning; perhaps there were German gunners on<br>the job. They bracketed neatly on Torre Fabian. One shell beyond it, one shell<br>short of it, then whizz-BOOM' Burst rafters leaping upwards and a sheet of<br>uralite skimming down the air like a nicked playing-card. The next shell took<br>off a corner of a building as neatly as a giant might do it with a knife. But<br>the cooks produced dinner on time--a memorable feat.<br><br>As the days went on the unseen but audible guns began each to assume a<br>distinct personality. There were the two batteries of Russian 75-mm. guns which<br>fired from close in our rear and which somehow evoked in my mind the picture of<br>a fat man hitting a golf-ball. These were the first Russian guns I had seen--or<br>heard, rather. They had a low trajectory and a very high velocity, so that you<br>heard the cartridge explosion, the whizz, and the shell-burst almost<br>simultaneously. Behind Monflorite were two very heavy guns which fired a few<br>times a day, with a deep, muffled roar that was like the baying of distant<br>chained-up monsters. Up at Mount Aragon, the medieval fortress which the<br>Government troops had stormed last year (the first time in its history, it was<br>said), and which guarded one of the approaches to Huesca, there was a heavy gun<br>which must have dated well back into the nineteenth century. Its great shells<br>whistled over so slowly that you felt certain you could run beside them and keep<br>up with them. A shell from this gun sounded like nothing so much as a man riding<br>along on a bicycle and whistling. The trench-mortars, small though they were,<br>made the most evil sound of all. Their shells are really a kind of winged<br>torpedo, shaped like the darts thrown in public-houses and about the size of a<br>quart bottle; they go off with a devilish metallic crash, as of some monstrous<br>globe of brittle steel being shattered on an anvil. Sometimes our aeroplanes<br>flew over and let loose the aerial torpedoes whose tremendous echoing roar makes<br>the earth tremble even at two miles' distance. The shell-bursts from the Fascist<br>anti--aircraft guns dotted the sky like cloudlets in a bad water-colour, but I<br>never saw them get within a thousand yards of an aeroplane. When an aeroplane<br>swoops down and uses its machine-gun the sound, from below, is like the<br>fluttering of wings.<br><br>On our part of the line not much was happening. Two hundred yards to the<br>right of us, where the Fascists were on higher ground, their snipers picked off<br>a few of our comrades. Two hundred yards to the left, at the bridge over the<br>stream, a sort of duel was going on between the Fascist mortars and the men who<br>were building a concrete barricade across the bridge. The evil little shells<br>whizzed over, zwing-crash! zwing-crash!, making a doubly diabolical noise when<br>they landed on the asphalt road. A hundred yards away you could stand in perfect<br>safety and watch the columns of earth and black smoke leaping into the air like<br>magic trees. The poor devils round the bridge spent much of the daytime cowering<br>in the little man-holes they had scooped in the side of the trench. But there<br>were less casualties than might have been expected, and the barricade rose<br>steadily, a wall of concrete two feet thick, with embrasures for two<br>machine-guns and a small field gun. The concrete was being reinforced with old<br>bedsteads, which apparently was the only iron that could be found for the<br>purpose.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/4.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/6.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
