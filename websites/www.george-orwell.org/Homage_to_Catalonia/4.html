<h2>Chapter 5</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>ON the eastern side of Huesca, until late March, nothing happened--almost<br>literally nothing. We were twelve hundred metres from the enemy. When the<br>Fascists were driven back into Huesca the Republican Army troops who held this<br>part of the line had not been over-zealous in their advance, so that the line<br>formed a kind of pocket. Later it would have to be advanced--a ticklish job<br>under fire--but for the present the enemy might as well have been nonexistent;<br>our sole preoccupation was keeping warm and getting enough to eat. As a matter<br>of fact there were things in this period that interested me greatly, and I will<br>describe some of them later. But I shall be keeping nearer to the order of<br>events if I try here to give some account of the internal political situation on<br>the Government side.<br><br>At the beginning I had ignored the political side of the war, and it was only<br>about this time that it began to force itself upon my attention. If you are not<br>interested in the horrors of party politics, please skip; I am trying to keep<br>the political parts of this narrative in separate chapters for precisely that<br>purpose. But at the same time it would be quite impossible to write about the<br>Spanish war from a purely military angle. It was above all things a political<br>war. No event in it, at any rate during the first year, is intelligible unless<br>one has some grasp of the inter-party struggle that was going on behind the<br>Government lines.<br><br>When I came to Spain, and for some time afterwards, I was not only<br>uninterested in the political situation but unaware of it. I knew there was a<br>war on, but I had no notion what kind of a war. If you had asked me why I had<br>joined the militia I should have answered: 'To fight against Fascism,' and if<br>you had asked me what I was fighting for, I should have answered: 'Common<br>decency.' I had accepted the News Chronicle-New Statesman version of the war as<br>the defence of civilization against a maniacal outbreak by an army of Colonel<br>Blimps in the pay of Hitler. The revolutionary atmosphere of Barcelona had<br>attracted me deeply, but I had made no attempt to understand it. As for the<br>kaleidoscope of political parties and trade unions, with their tiresome names--<br>P.S.U.C., P.O.U.M., F.A.I., C.N.T., U.G.T., J.C.I., J.S.U., A.I.T.--they merely<br>exasperated me. It looked at first sight as though Spain were suffering from a<br>plague of initials. I knew that I was serving in something called the P.O.U.M.<br>(I had only joined the P.O.U.M. militia rather than any other because I happened<br>to arrive in Barcelona with I.L.P. papers), but I did not realize that there<br>were serious differences between the political parties. At Monte Pocero, when<br>they pointed to the position on our left and said:<br><br>'Those are the Socialists' (meaning the P.S.U.C.), I was puzzled and said:<br>'Aren't we all Socialists?' I thought it idiotic that people fighting for their<br>lives should have separate parties; my attitude always was, 'Why can't we drop<br>all this political nonsense and get on with the war?' This of course was the<br>correct' anti-Fascist' attitude which had been carefully disseminated by the<br>English newspapers, largely in order to prevent people from grasping the real<br>nature of the struggle. But in Spain, especially in Catalonia, it was an<br>attitude that no one could or did keep up indefinitely. Everyone, however<br>unwillingly, took sides sooner or later. For even if one cared nothing for the<br>political parties and their conflicting 'lines', it was too obvious that one's<br>own destiny was involved. As a militiaman one was a soldier against Franco, but<br>one was also a pawn in an enormous struggle that was being fought out between<br>two political theories. When I scrounged for firewood on the mountainside and<br>wondered whether this was really a war or whether the News Chronicle had made it<br>up, when I dodged the Communist machine-guns in the Barcelona riots, when I<br>finally fled from Spain with the police one jump behind me--all these things<br>happened to me in that particular way because I was serving in the P.O.U.M.<br>militia and not in the P.S.U.C. So great is the difference between two sets of<br>initials!<br><br>To understand the alignment on the Government side one has got to remember<br>how the war started. When the fighting broke out on 18 July it is probable that<br>every anti-Fascist in Europe felt a thrill of hope. For here at last,<br>apparently, was democracy standing up to Fascism. For years past the so-called<br>democratic countries had been surrendering to Fascism at every step. The<br>Japanese had been allowed to do as they liked in Manchuria. Hitler had walked<br>into power and proceeded to massacre political opponents of all shades.<br>Mussolini had bombed the Abyssinians while fifty-three nations (I think it was<br>fifty-three) made pious noises 'off'. But when Franco tried to overthrow a<br>mildly Left-wing Government the Spanish people, against all expectation, had<br>risen against him. It seemed--possibly it was--the turning of the tide.<br><br>But there were several points that escaped general notice. To begin with,<br>Franco was not strictly comparable with Hitler or Mussolini. His rising was a<br>military mutiny backed up by the aristocracy and the Church, and in the main,<br>especially at the beginning, it was an attempt not so much to impose Fascism as<br>to restore feudalism. This meant that Franco had against him not only the<br>working class but also various sections of the liberal bourgeoisie--the very<br>people who are the supporters of Fascism when it appears in a more modern form.<br>More important than this was the fact that the Spanish working class did not, as<br>we might conceivably do in England, resist Franco in the name of 'democracy' and<br>the status quo', their resistance was accompanied by--one might almost say it<br>consisted of--a definite revolutionary outbreak. Land was seized by the<br>peasants; many factories and most of the transport were seized by the trade<br>unions; churches were wrecked and the priests driven out or killed. The Daily<br>Mail, amid the cheers of the Catholic clergy, was able to represent Franco as a<br>patriot delivering his country from hordes of fiendish 'Reds'.<br><br>For the first few months of the war Franco's real opponent was not so much<br>the Government as the trade unions. As soon as the rising broke out the<br>organized town workers replied by calling a general strike and then by demanding<br>--and, after a struggle, getting--arms from the public arsenals. If they had<br>not acted spontaneously and more or less independently it is quite conceivable<br>that Franco would never have been resisted. There can, of course, be no<br>certainty about this, but there is at least reason for thinking it. The<br>Government had made little or no attempt to forestall the rising, which had been<br>foreseen for a long time past, and when the trouble started its attitude was<br>weak and hesitant, so much so, indeed, that Spain had three premiers in a single<br>day. [Note 1, below] Moreover, the one step that could save the immediate situation,<br>the arming of the workers, was only taken unwillingly and in response to violent<br>popular clamour. However, the arms were distributed, and in the big towns of<br>eastern Spain the Fascists were defeated by a huge effort, mainly of the working<br>class, aided by some of the armed forces (Assault Guards, etc.) who had remained<br>loyal. It was the kind of effort that could probably only be made by people who were<br>fighting with a revolutionary intention--i.e. believed that they were fighting<br>for something better than the status quo. In the various centres of revolt it is<br>thought that three thousand people died in the streets in a single day. Men and<br>women armed only with sticks of dynamite rushed across the open squares and<br>stormed stone buildings held by trained soldiers with machine-guns. Machine-gun<br>nests that the Fascists had placed at strategic spots were smashed by rushing<br>taxis at them at sixty miles an hour. Even if one had heard nothing of the<br>seizure of the land by the peasants, the setting up of local Soviets, etc., it<br>would be hard to believe that the Anarchists and Socialists who were the<br>backbone of the resistance were doing this kind of thing for the preservation of<br>capitalist democracy, which especially in the Anarchist view was no more than a<br>centralized swindling machine.<br><br>[Note 1. Quiroga, Barrios, and Giral. The first two refused to distribute arms<br>to the trade unions.]<br><br>Meanwhile the workers had weapons in their hands, and at this stage they<br>refrained from giving them up. (Even a year later it was computed that the<br>Anarcho-Syndicalists in Catalonia possessed 30,000 rifles.) The estates of the<br>big pro-Fascist landlords were in many places seized by the peasants. Along with<br>the collectivization of industry and transport there was an attempt to set up<br>the rough beginnings of a workers' government by means of local committees,<br>workers' patrols to replace the old pro-capitalist police forces, workers'<br>militias based on the trade unions, and so forth. Of course the process was not<br>uniform, and it went further in Catalonia than elsewhere. There were areas where<br>the institutions of local government remained almost untouched, and others where<br>they existed side by side with revolutionary committees. In a few places<br>independent Anarchist communes were set up, and some of them remained in being<br>till about a year later, when they were forcibly suppressed by the Government.<br>In Catalonia, for the first few months, most of the actual power was in the<br>hands of the Anarcho-syndicalists, who controlled most of the key industries.<br>The thing that had happened in Spain was, in fact, not merely a civil war, but<br>the beginning of a revolution. It is this fact that the anti-Fascist press<br>outside Spain has made it its special business to obscure. The issue has been<br>narrowed down to 'Fascism versus democracy' and the revolutionary aspect<br>concealed as much as possible. In England, where the Press is more centralized<br>and the public more easily deceived than elsewhere, only two versions of the<br>Spanish war have had any publicity to speak of: the Right-wing version of<br>Christian patriots versus Bolsheviks dripping with blood, and the Left-wing<br>version of gentlemanly republicans quelling a military revolt. The central issue<br>has been successfully covered up.<br><br>There were several reasons for this. To begin with, appalling lies about<br>atrocities were being circulated by the pro-Fascist press, and well-meaning<br>propagandists undoubtedly thought that they were aiding the Spanish Government<br>by denying that Spain had 'gone Red'. But the main reason was this: that, except<br>for the small revolutionary groups which exist in all countries, the whole world<br>was determined, upon preventing revolution in Spain. In particular the Communist<br>Party, with Soviet Russia behind it, had thrown its whole weight against the<br>revolution. It was the Communist thesis that revolution at this stage would be<br>fatal and that what was to be aimed at in Spain was not workers' control, but<br>bourgeois democracy. It hardly needs pointing out why 'liberal' capitalist<br>opinion took the same line. Foreign capital was heavily invested in Spain. The<br>Barcelona Traction Company, for instance, represented ten millions of British<br>capital; and meanwhile the trade unions had seized all the transport in<br>Catalonia. If the revolution went forward there would be no compensation, or<br>very little; if the capitalist republic prevailed, foreign investments would be<br>safe. And since the revolution had got to be crushed, it greatly simplified<br>things to pretend that no revolution had happened. In this way the real<br>significance of every event could be covered up; every shift of power from the<br>trade unions to the central Government could be represented as a necessary step<br>in military reorganization. The situation produced was curious in the extreme.<br>Outside Spain few people grasped that there was a revolution; inside Spain<br>nobody doubted it. Even the P.S.U.C. newspapers. Communist-controlled and more<br>or less committed to an anti-revolutionary policy, talked about 'our glorious<br>revolution'. And meanwhile the Communist press in foreign countries was shouting<br>that there was no sign of revolution anywhere; the seizure of factories, setting<br>up of workers' committees, etc., had not happened--or, alternatively, had<br>happened, but 'had no political significance'. According to the Daily Worker (6<br>August 1936) those who said that the Spanish people were fighting for social<br>revolution, or for anything other than bourgeois democracy, were' downright<br>lying scoundrels'. On the other hand, Juan Lopez, a member of the Valencia<br>Government, declared in February 1937 that 'the Spanish people are shedding<br>their blood, not for the democratic Republic and its paper Constitution, but<br>for . . . a revolution'. So it would appear that the downright lying scoundrels<br>included members of the Government for which we were bidden to fight. Some of<br>the foreign anti-Fascist papers even descended to the pitiful lie of pretending<br>that churches were only attacked when they were used as Fascist fortresses.<br>Actually churches were pillaged everywhere and as a matter of course, because it<br>was perfectly well understood that the Spanish Church was part of the capitalist<br>racket. In six months in Spain I only saw two undamaged churches, and until<br>about July 1937 no churches were allowed to reopen and hold services, except for<br>one or two Protestant churches in Madrid.<br><br>But, after all, it was only the beginning of a revolution, not the complete<br>thing. Even when the workers, certainly in Catalonia and possibly elsewhere, had<br>the power to do so, they did not overthrow or completely replace the Government.<br>Obviously they could not do so when Franco was hammering at the gate and<br>sections of the middle class were on their side. The country was in a<br>transitional state that was capable either of developing in the direction of<br>Socialism or of reverting to an ordinary capitalist republic. The peasants had<br>most of the land, and they were likely to keep it, unless Franco won; all large<br>industries had been collectivized, but whether they remained collectivized, or<br>whether capitalism was reintroduced, would depend finally upon which group<br>gained control. At the beginning both the Central Government and the Generalite<br>de Cataluna (the semi-autonomous Catalan Government) could definitely be said to<br>represent the working class. The Government was headed by Caballero, a Left-wing<br>Socialist, and contained ministers representing the U.G.T. (Socialist trade<br>unions) and the C.N.T. (Syndicalist unions controlled by the Anarchists). The<br>Catalan Generalite was for a while virtually superseded by an anti-Fascist<br>Defence Committee [Note 2, below] consisting mainly of delegates from the trade<br>unions. Later the Defence Committee was dissolved and the Generalite was<br>reconstituted so as to represent the unions and the various Left-wing parties.<br>But every subsequent reshuffling of the Government was a move towards the Right.<br>First the P.O.U.M. was expelled from the Generalite; six months later Caballero<br>was replaced by the Right-wing Socialist Negrin; shortly afterwards the C.N.T.<br>was eliminated from the Government; then the U.G.T.; then the C.N.T. was turned<br>out of the Generalite; finally, a year after the outbreak of war and revolution,<br>there remained a Government composed entirely of Right-wing Socialists, Liberals,<br>and Communists.<br><br>[Note 2. Comite Central de Milicias Antifascistas.<br>Delegates were chosen in proportion to the membership of their organizations.<br>Nine delegates represented the trade unions, three the Catalan Liberal parties,<br>and two the various Marxist parties (P.O.U.M., Communists, and others).]<br><br>The general swing to the Right dates from about October-November 1936, when<br>the U.S.S.R. began to supply arms to the Government and power began to pass from<br>the Anarchists to the Communists. Except Russia and Mexico no country had had<br>the decency to come to the rescue of the Government, and Mexico, for obvious<br>reasons, could not supply arms in large quantities. Consequently the Russians<br>were in a position to dictate terms. There is very little doubt that these terms<br>were, in substance, 'Prevent revolution or you get no weapons', and that the<br>first move against the revolutionary elements, the expulsion of the P.O.U.M.<br>from the Catalan Generalite, was done under orders from the U.S.S.R. It has been<br>denied that any direct pressure was exerted by the Russian Government, but the<br>point is not of great importance, for the Communist parties of all countries can<br>be taken as carrying out Russian policy, and it is not denied that the Communist<br>Party was the chief mover first against the P.O.U.M., later against the<br>Anarchists and against Caballero's section of the Socialists, and, in general,<br>against a revolutionary policy. Once the U.S.S.R. had intervened the triumph of<br>the Communist Party was assured. To begin with, gratitude to Russia for the arms<br>and the fact that the Communist Party, especially since the arrival of the<br>International Brigades, looked capable of winning the war, immensely raised the<br>Communist prestige. Secondly, the Russian arms were supplied via the Communist<br>Party and the parties allied to them, who saw to it that as few as possible got<br>to their political opponents. [Note 3, below] Thirdly, by proclaiming<br>a non-revolutionary policy the Communists were able to gather in<br>all those whom the extremists had scared. It was easy, for instance, to rally<br>the wealthier peasants against the collectivization policy of the Anarchists.<br>There was an enormous growth in the membership of the party, and the influx was<br>largely from the middle class--shopkeepers, officials, army officers,<br>well-to-do peasants, etc., etc. The war was essentially a triangular struggle.<br>The fight against Franco had to continue, but the simultaneous aim of the<br>Government was to recover such power as remained in the hands of the trade<br>unions. It was done by a series of small moves--a policy of pin-pricks, as<br>somebody called it--and on the whole very cleverly. There was no general and<br>obvious counter-revolutionary move, and until May 1937 it was scarcely necessary<br>to use force. The workers could always be brought to heel by an argument that is<br>almost too obvious to need stating: 'Unless you do this, that, and the other we<br>shall lose the war.' In every case, needless to say, it appeared that the thing<br>demanded by military necessity was the surrender of something that the workers<br>had won for themselves in 1936. But the argument could hardly fail, because to<br>lose the war was the last thing that the revolutionary parties wanted; if the<br>war was lost democracy and revolution. Socialism and Anarchism, became<br>meaningless words. The Anarchists, the only revolutionary party that was big<br>enough to matter, were obliged to give way on point after point. The process of<br>collectivization was checked, the local committees were got rid of, the workers<br>patrols were abolished and the pre-war police forces, largely reinforced and<br>very heavily armed, were restored, and various key industries which had been<br>under the control of the trade unions were taken over by the Government (the<br>seizure of the Barcelona Telephone Exchange, which led to the May fighting, was<br>one incident in this process); finally, most important of all, the workers'<br>militias, based on the trade unions, were gradually broken up and redistributed<br>among the new Popular Army, a 'non-political' army on semi-bourgeois lines, with<br>a differential pay rate, a privileged officer-caste, etc., etc. In the special<br>circumstances this was the really decisive step; it happened later in Catalonia<br>than elsewhere because it was there that the revolutionary parties were<br>strongest. Obviously the only guarantee that the workers could have of retaining<br>their winnings was to keep some of the armed forces under their own control. As<br>usual, the breaking-up of the militias was done in the name of military<br>efficiency; and no one denied that a thorough military reorganization was<br>needed. It would, however, have been quite possible to reorganize the militias<br>and make them more efficient while keeping them under direct control of the<br>trade unions; the main purpose of the change was to make sure that the<br>Anarchists did not possess an army of their own. Moreover, the democratic spirit<br>of the militias made them breeding-grounds for revolutionary ideas. The<br>Communists were well aware of this, and inveighed ceaselessly and bitterly<br>against the P.O.U.M. and Anarchist principle of equal pay for all ranks. A<br>general 'bourgeoisification', a deliberate destruction of the equalitarian<br>spirit of the first few months of the revolution, was taking place. All happened<br>so swiftly that people making successive visits to Spain at intervals of a few<br>months have declared that they seemed scarcely to be visiting the same country;<br>what had seemed on the surface and for a brief instant to be a workers' State<br>was changing before one's eyes into an ordinary bourgeois republic with the<br>normal division into rich and poor. By the autumn of 1937 the 'Socialist' Negrin<br>was declaring in public speeches that 'we respect private property', and members<br>of the Cortes who at the beginning of the war had had to fly the country because<br>of their suspected Fascist sympathies were returning to Spain. The whole process<br>is easy to understand if one remembers that it proceeds from the temporary<br>alliance that Fascism, in certain forms, forces upon the bourgeois and the<br>worker. This alliance, known as the Popular Front, is in essential an alliance<br>of enemies, and it seems probable that it must always end by one partner<br>swallowing the other. The only unexpected feature in the Spanish situation--and<br>outside Spain it has caused an immense amount of misunderstanding--is that<br>among the parties on the Government side the Communists stood not upon the<br>extreme Left, but upon the extreme Right. In reality this should cause no<br>surprise, because the tactics of the Communist Party elsewhere, especially in<br>France, have made it clear that Official Communism must be regarded, at any rate<br>for the time being, as an anti-revolutionary force. The whole of Comintern<br>policy is now subordinated (excusably, considering the world situation) to the<br>defence of U.S.S.R., which depends upon a system of military alliances. In<br>particular, the U.S.S.R. is in alliance with France, a capitalist-imperialist<br>country. The alliance is of little use to Russia unless French capitalism is<br>strong, therefore Communist policy in France has got to be anti-revolutionary.<br>This means not only that French Communists now march behind the tricolour and<br>sing the Marseillaise, but, what is more important, that they have had to drop<br>all effective agitation in the French colonies. It is less than three years<br>since Thorez, the Secretary of the French Communist Party, was declaring that<br>the French workers would never be bamboozled into fighting against their German<br>comrades; [Note 4, below] he is now one of the loudest-lunged patriots<br>in France. The clue to the behaviour of the Communist Party in any country<br>is the military relation of that country, actual or potential, towards the<br>U.S.S.R. In England, for instance, the position is still uncertain,<br>hence the English Communist Party is still hostile to the National<br>Government, and, ostensibly, opposed to rearmament. If, however,<br>Great Britain enters into an alliance or military understanding with the<br>U.S.S.R., the English Communist, like the French Communist, will have no choice<br>but to become a good patriot and imperialist; there are premonitory signs of<br>this already. In Spain the Communist 'line' was undoubtedly influenced by the<br>fact that France, Russia's ally, would strongly object to a revolutionary<br>neighbour and would raise heaven and earth to prevent the liberation of Spanish<br>Morocco. The Daily Mail, with its tales of red revolution financed by Moscow,<br>was even more wildly wrong than usual. In reality it was the Communists above<br>all others who prevented revolution in Spain. Later, when the Right-wing forces<br>were in full control, the Communists showed themselves willing to go a great<br>deal further than the Liberals in hunting down the revolutionary leaders.<br>[Note 5, below]<br><br>[Note 3. This was why there were so few Russian arms on<br>the Aragon front, where the troops were predominantly Anarchist. Until April<br>1937 the only Russian weapon I saw--with the exception of some aeroplanes which<br>may or may not have been Russian--was a solitary sub-machine-gun.]<br><br>[Note 4. In the Chamber of Deputies, March 1935.]<br><br>[Note 5. For the best account of the interplay between<br>the parties on the Government side, see Franz Borkenau's The Spanish Cockpit.<br>This is by a long way the ablest book that has yet appeared on the Spanish war.]<br><br>I have tried to sketch the general course of the Spanish revolution during<br>its first year, because this makes it easier to understand the situation at any<br>given moment. But I do not want to suggest that in February I held all of the<br>opinions that are implied in what I have said above. To begin with, the things<br>that most enlightened me had not yet happened, and in any case my sympathies<br>were in some ways different from what they are now. This was partly because the<br>political side of the war bored me and I naturally reacted against the viewpoint<br>of which I heard most--i.e. the P.O.U.M.-I.L.P. viewpoint. The Englishmen I was<br>among were mostly I.L.P. members, with a few C.P. members among them, and most<br>of them were much better educated politically than myself. For weeks on end,<br>during the dull period when nothing was happening round Huesca, I found myself<br>in the middle of a political discussion that practically never ended. In the<br>draughty evil-smelling barn of the farm-house where we were billeted, in the<br>stuffy blackness of dug-outs, behind the parapet in the freezing midnight hours,<br>the conflicting party 'lines' were debated over and over. Among the Spaniards it<br>was the same, and most of the newspapers we saw made the inter-party feud their<br>chief feature. One would have had to be deaf or an imbecile not to pick up some<br>idea of what the various parties stood for.<br><br>From the point of view of political theory there were only three parties that<br>mattered, the P.S.U.C., the P.O.U.M., and the C.N.T.-F.A.I., loosely described<br>as the Anarchists. I take the P.S.U.C. first, as being the most important; it<br>was the party that finally triumphed, and even at this time it was visibly in<br>the ascendant.<br><br>It is necessary to explain that when one speaks of the P.S.U.C. 'line' one<br>really means the Communist Party 'line'. The P.S.U.C. (Partido Socialista<br>Unificado de Cataluna) was the Socialist Party of Catalonia; it had been formed<br>at the beginning of the war by the fusion of various Marxist parties, including<br>the Catalan Communist Party, but it was now entirely under Communist control and<br>was affiliated to the Third International. Elsewhere in Spain no formal<br>unification between Socialists and Communists had taken place, but the Communist<br>viewpoint and the Right-wing Socialist viewpoint could everywhere be regarded as<br>identical. Roughly speaking, the P.S.U.C. was the political organ of the U.G.T.<br>(Union General de Trabajadores), the Socialist trade unions. The membership of<br>these unions throughout Spain now numbered about a million and a half. They<br>contained many sections of the manual workers, but since the outbreak of war<br>they had also been swollen by a large influx of middle-class members, for in the<br>early 'revolutionary' days people of all kinds had found it useful to join<br>either the U.G.T. or the C.N.T. The two blocks of unions overlapped, but of the<br>two the C.N.T. was more definitely a working-class organization. The P.S.U.C.<br>was therefore a party partly of the workers and partly of the small bourgeoisie<br>--the shopkeepers, the officials, and the wealthier peasants.<br><br>The P.S.U.C. 'line' which was preached in the Communist and pro--Communist<br>press throughout the world, was approximately this:<br><br>'At present nothing matters except winning the war; without victory in the<br>war all else is meaningless. Therefore this is not the moment to talk of<br>pressing forward with the revolution. We can't afford to alienate the peasants<br>by forcing Collectivization upon them, and we can't afford to frighten away the<br>middle classes who were fighting on our side. Above all for the sake of<br>efficiency we must do away with revolutionary chaos. We must have a strong<br>central government in place of local committees, and we must have a properly<br>trained and fully militarized army under a unified command. Clinging on to<br>fragments of workers' control and parroting revolutionary phrases is worse than<br>useless; it is not merely obstructive, but even counterrevolutionary, because it<br>leads to divisions which can be used against us by the Fascists. At this stage<br>we are not fighting for the dictatorship of the proletariat, we are fighting for<br>parliamentary democracy. Whoever tries to turn the civil war into a social<br>revolution is playing into the hands of the Fascists and is in effect, if not in<br>intention, a traitor.'<br><br>The P.O.U.M. 'line' differed from this on every point except, of course, the<br>importance of winning the war. The P.O.U.M. (Partido Obrero de Unificacion<br>Marxista) was one of those dissident Communist parties which have appeared in<br>many countries in the last few years as a result of the opposition to<br>'Stalinism'; i.e. to the change, real or apparent, in Communist policy. It was<br>made up partly of ex-Communists and partly of an earlier party, the Workers' and<br>Peasants' Bloc. Numerically it was a small party, [Note 6, below] with not<br>much influence outside Catalonia, and chiefly important because it contained an<br>unusually high proportion of politically conscious members. In Catalonia its<br>chief stronghold was Lerida. It did not represent any block of trade unions. The<br>P.O.U.M. militiamen were mostly C.N.T. members, but the actual party-members<br>generally belonged to the U.G.T. It was, however, only in the C.N.T. that the<br>P.O.U.M. had any influence. The P.O.U.M. 'line' was approximately this:<br><br>[Note 6. The figures for the P.O.U.M. membership are<br>given as: July 1936, 10,000; December 1936, 70,000; June 1937, 40,000. But these<br>are from P.O.U.M. sources; a hostile estimate would probably divide them by<br>four. The only thing one can say with any certainty about the membership of the<br>Spanish political parties is that every party over-estimates its own<br>numbers.]<br><br>'It is nonsense to talk of opposing Fascism by bourgeois "democracy".<br>Bourgeois "democracy" is only another name for capitalism, and so is Fascism; to<br>fight against Fascism on behalf of "democracy" is to fight against one form of<br>capitalism on behalf of a second which is liable to turn into the first at any<br>moment. The only real alternative to Fascism is workers' control. If you set up<br>any less goal than this, you will either hand the victory to Franco, or, at<br>best, let in Fascism by the back door. Meanwhile the workers must cling to every<br>scrap of what they have won; if they yield anything to the semi--bourgeois<br>Government they can depend upon being cheated. The workers' militias and<br>police-forces must be preserved in their present form and every effort to<br>"bourgeoisify" them must be resisted. If the workers do not control the armed<br>forces, the armed forces will control the workers. The war and the revolution<br>are inseparable.'<br><br>The Anarchist viewpoint is less easily defined. In any case the loose term<br>'Anarchists' is used to cover a multitude of people of very varying opinions.<br>The huge block of unions making up the C.N.T. (Confederacion Nacional de<br>Trabajadores), with round about two million members in all, had for its<br>political organ the F.A.I. (Federacion Anarquista Iberica), an actual Anarchist<br>organization. But even the members of the F.A.I., though always tinged, as<br>perhaps most Spaniards are, with the Anarchist philosophy, were not necessarily<br>Anarchists in the purest sense. Especially since the beginning of the war they<br>had moved more in the direction of ordinary Socialism, because circumstances had<br>forced them to take part in centralized administration and even to break all<br>their principles by entering the Government. Nevertheless they differed<br>fundamentally from the Communists in so much that, like the P.O.U.M., they aimed<br>at workers' control and not a parliamentary democracy. They accepted the<br>P.O.U.M. slogan: 'The war and the revolution are inseparable', though they were<br>less dogmatic about it. Roughly speaking, the C.N.T.-F.A.I. stood for: (i)<br>Direct control over industry by the workers engaged in each industry, e.g.<br>transport, the textile factories, etc.; (2) Government by local committees and<br>resistance to all forms of centralized authoritarianism; (3) Uncompromising<br>hostility to the bourgeoisie and the Church. The last point, though the least<br>precise, was the most important. The Anarchists were the opposite of the<br>majority of so-called revolutionaries in so much that though their principles<br>were rather vague their hatred of privilege and injustice was perfectly genuine.<br>Philosophically, Communism and Anarchism are poles apart. Practically--i.e. in<br>the form of society aimed at--the difference is mainly one of emphasis, but it<br>is quite irreconcilable. The Communist's emphasis is always on centralism and<br>efficiency, the Anarchist's on liberty and equality. Anarchism is deeply rooted<br>in Spain and is likely to outlive Communism when the Russian influence is<br>withdrawn. During the first two months of the war it was the Anarchists more<br>than anyone else who had saved the situation, and much later than this the<br>Anarchist militia, in spite of their indiscipline, were notoriously the best<br>fighters among the purely Spanish forces. From about February 1937 onwards the<br>Anarchists and the P.O.U.M. could to some extent be lumped together. If the<br>Anarchists, the P.O.U.M., and the Left wing of the Socialists had had the sense<br>to combine at the start and press a realistic policy, the history of the war<br>might have been different. But in the early period, when the revolutionary<br>parties seemed to have the game in their hands, this was impossible. Between the<br>Anarchists and the Socialists there were ancient jealousies, the P.O.U.M., as<br>Marxists, were sceptical of Anarchism, while from the pure Anarchist standpoint<br>the 'Trotskyism' of the P.O.U.M. was not much preferable to the 'Stalinism' of<br>the Communists. Nevertheless the Communist tactics tended to drive the two<br>parties together. When the P.O.U.M. joined in the disastrous fighting in<br>Barcelona in May, it was mainly from an instinct to stand by the C.N.T., and<br>later, when the P.O.U.M. was suppressed, the Anarchists were the only people who<br>dared to raise a voice in its defence.<br><br>So, roughly speaking, the alignment of forces was this. On the one side the<br>C.N.T.-F.A.I., the P.O.U.M., and a section of the Socialists, standing for<br>workers' control: on the other side the Right-wing Socialists, Liberals, and<br>Communists, standing for centralized government and a militarized army.<br><br>It is easy to see why, at this time, I preferred the Communist viewpoint to<br>that of the P.O.U.M. The Communists had a definite practical policy, an<br>obviously better policy from the point of view of the common sense which looks<br>only a few months ahead. And certainly the day-to-day policy of the P.O.U.M.,<br>their propaganda and so forth, was unspeakably bad; it must have been so, or<br>they would have been able to attract a bigger mass-following. What clinched<br>everything was that the Communists--so it seemed to me--were getting on with<br>the war while we and the Anarchists were standing still. This was the general<br>feeling at the time. The Communists had gained power and a vast increase of<br>membership partly by appealing to the middle classes against the<br>revolutionaries, but partly also because they were the only people who looked<br>capable of winning the war. The Russian arms and the magnificent defence of<br>Madrid by troops mainly under Communist control had made the Communists the<br>heroes of Spain. As someone put it, every Russian aeroplane that flew over our<br>heads was Communist propaganda. The revolutionary purism of the P.O.U.M., though<br>I saw its logic, seemed to me rather futile. After all, the one thing that<br>mattered was to win the war.<br><br>Meanwhile there was the diabolical inter-party feud that was going on in the<br>newspapers, in pamphlets, on posters, in books--everywhere. At this time the<br>newspapers I saw most often were the P.O.U.M. papers La Batalla and Adelante,<br>and their ceaseless carping against the 'counter-revolutionary' P.S.U.C. struck<br>me as priggish and tiresome. Later, when I studied the P.S.U.C. and Communist<br>press more closely, I realized that the P.O.U.M. were almost blameless compared<br>with their adversaries. Apart from anything else, they had much smaller<br>opportunities. Unlike the Communists, they had no footing in any press outside<br>their own country, and inside Spain they were at an immense disadvantage because<br>the press censorship was mainly under Communist control, which meant that the<br>P.O.U.M. papers were liable to be suppressed or fined if they said anything<br>damaging. It is also fair to the P.O.U.M. to say that though they might preach<br>endless sermons on revolution and quote Lenin ad nauseam, they did not usually<br>indulge in personal libel. Also they kept their polemics mainly to newspaper<br>articles. Their large coloured posters, designed for a wider public (posters are<br>important in Spain, with its large illiterate population), did not attack rival<br>parties, but were simply anti--Fascist or abstractedly revolutionary; so were<br>the songs the militiamen sang. The Communist attacks were quite a different<br>matter. I shall have to deal with some of these later in this book. Here I can<br>only give a brief indication of the Communist line of attack.<br><br>On the surface the quarrel between the Communists and the P.O.U.M. was one of<br>tactics. The P.O.U.M. was for immediate revolution, the Communists not. So far<br>so good; there was much to be said on both sides. Further, the Communists<br>contended that the P.O.U.M. propaganda divided and weakened the Government<br>forces and thus endangered the war; again, though finally I do not agree, a good<br>case could be made out for this. But here the peculiarity of Communist tactics<br>came in. Tentatively at first, then more loudly, they began to assert that the<br>P.O.U.M. was splitting the Government forces not by bad judgement but by<br>deliberate design. The P.O.U.M. was declared to be no more than a gang of<br>disguised Fascists, in the pay of Franco and Hitler, who were pressing a<br>pseudo-revolutionary policy as a way of aiding the Fascist cause. The P.O.U.M.<br>was a 'Trotskyist' organization and 'Franco's Fifth Column'. This implied that<br>scores of thousands of working-class people, including eight or ten thousand<br>soldiers who were freezing in the front-line trenches and hundreds of foreigners<br>who had come to Spain to fight against Fascism, often sacrificing their<br>livelihood and their nationality by doing so, were simply traitors in the pay of<br>the enemy. And this story was spread all over Spain by means of posters, etc.,<br>and repeated over and over in the Communist and pro-Communist press of the whole<br>world. I could fill half a dozen books with quotations if I chose to collect<br>them.<br><br>This, then, was what they were saying about us: we were Trotskyists,<br>Fascists, traitors, murderers, cowards, spies, and so forth. I admit it was not<br>pleasant, especially when one thought of some of the people who were responsible<br>for it. It is not a nice thing to see a Spanish boy of fifteen carried down the<br>line on a stretcher, with a dazed white face looking out from among the<br>blankets, and to think of the sleek persons in London and Paris who are writing<br>pamphlets to prove that this boy is a Fascist in disguise. One of the most<br>horrible features of war is that all the war-propaganda, all the screaming and<br>lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting. The P.S.U.C.<br>militiamen whom I knew in the line, the Communists from the International<br>Brigade whom I met from time to time, never called me a Trotskyist or a traitor;<br>they left that kind of thing to the journalists in the rear. The people who<br>wrote pamphlets against us and vilified us in the newspapers all remained safe<br>at home, or at worst in the newspaper offices of Valencia, hundreds of miles<br>from the bullets and the mud. And apart from the libels of the inter-party feud,<br>all the usual war-stuff, the tub-thumping, the heroics, the vilification of the<br>enemy--all these were done, as usual, by people who were not fighting and who<br>in many cases would have run a hundred miles sooner than fight. One of the<br>dreariest effects of this war has been to teach me that the Left-wing press is<br>every bit as spurious and dishonest as that of the Right. [Note 7, below] I do<br>earnestly feel that on our side--the Government side--this war was different<br>from ordinary, imperialistic wars; but from the nature of the war-propaganda you<br>would never have guessed it. The fighting had barely started when the newspapers<br>of the Right and Left dived simultaneously into the same cesspool of abuse. We<br>all remember the Daily Mail's poster: 'REDS CRUCIFY NUNS', while to the Daily<br>Worker Franco's Foreign Legion was 'composed of murderers, white-slavers,<br>dope-fiends, and the offal of every European country'. As late as October 1937<br>the New Statesman was treating us to tales of Fascist barricades made of the<br>bodies of living children (a most unhandy thing to make barricades with), and Mr<br>Arthur Bryant was declaring that 'the sawing-off of a Conservative tradesman's<br>legs' was 'a commonplace' in Loyalist Spain. The people who write that kind of<br>stuff never fight; possibly they believe that to write it is a substitute for<br>fighting. It is the same in all wars; the soldiers do the fighting, the<br>journalists do the shouting, and no true patriot ever gets near a front-line<br>trench, except on the briefest of propaganda-tours. Sometimes it is a comfort to<br>me to think that the aeroplane is altering the conditions of war. Perhaps when<br>the next great war comes we may see that sight unprecedented in all history, a<br>jingo with a bullet-hole in him.<br><br>[Note 7. I should like to make an exception of the Manchester Guardian.<br>In connexion with this book I have had to go through the files of a good many<br>English papers. Of our larger papers, the Manchester Guardian is the only one<br>that leaves me with an increased respect for its honesty.]<br><br>As far as the journalistic part of it went, this war was a racket like all<br>other wars. But there was this difference, that whereas the journalists usually<br>reserve their most murderous invective for the enemy, in this case, as time went<br>on, the Communists and the P.O.U.M. came to write more bitterly about one<br>another than about the Fascists. Nevertheless at the time I could not bring<br>myself to take it very seriously. The inter-party feud was annoying and even<br>disgusting, but it appeared to me as a domestic squabble. I did not believe that<br>it would alter anything or that there was any really irreconcilable difference<br>of policy. I grasped that the Communists and Liberals had set their faces<br>against allowing the revolution to go forward; I did not grasp that they might<br>be capable of swinging it back.<br><br>There was a good reason for this. All this time I was at the front, and at<br>the front the social and political atmosphere did not change. I had left<br>Barcelona in early January and I did not go on leave till late April; and all<br>this time--indeed, till later--in the strip of Aragon controlled by Anarchist<br>and P.O.U.M. troops, the same conditions persisted, at least outwardly. The<br>revolutionary atmosphere remained as I had first known it. General and private,<br>peasant and militiaman, still met as equals; everyone drew the same pay, wore<br>the same clothes, ate the same food, and called everyone else 'thou' and<br>'comrade'; there was no boss-class, no menial-class, no beggars, no prostitutes,<br>no lawyers, no priests, no boot-licking, no cap-touching. I was breathing the<br>air of equality, and I was simple enough to imagine that it existed all over<br>Spain. I did not realize that more or less by chance I was isolated among the<br>most revolutionary section of the Spanish working class.<br><br>So, when my more politically educated comrades told me that one could not<br>take a purely military attitude towards the war, and that the choice lay between<br>revolution and Fascism, I was inclined to laugh at them. On the whole I accepted<br>the Communist viewpoint, which boiled down to saying: 'We can't talk of<br>revolution till we've won the war', and not the P.O.U.M. viewpoint, which boiled<br>down to saying: 'We must go forward or we shall go back.' When later on I<br>decided that the P.O.U.M. were right, or at any rate righter than the<br>Communists, it was not altogether upon a point of theory. On paper the Communist<br>case was a good one; the trouble was that their actual behaviour made it<br>difficult to believe that they were advancing it in good faith. The<br>often-repeated slogan: 'The war first and the revolution afterwards', though<br>devoutly believed in by the average P.S.U.C. militiaman, who honestly thought<br>that the revolution could continue when the war had been won, was eyewash. The<br>thing for which the Communists were working was not to postpone the Spanish<br>revolution till a more suitable time, but to make sure that it never happened.<br>This became more and more obvious as time went on, as power was twisted more and<br>more out of working-class hands, and as more and more revolutionaries of every<br>shade were flung into jail. Every move was made in the name of military<br>necessity, because this pretext was, so to speak, ready-made, but the effect was<br>to drive the workers back from an advantageous position and into a position in<br>which, when the war was over, they would find it impossible to resist the<br>reintroduction of capitalism. Please notice that I am saying nothing against the<br>rank-and-file Communists, least of all against the thousands of Communists who<br>died heroically round Madrid. But those were not the men who were directing<br>party policy. As for the people higher up, it is inconceivable that they were<br>not acting with their eyes open.<br><br>But, finally, the war was worth winning even if the revolution was lost. And<br>in the end I came to doubt whether, in the long run, the Communist policy made<br>for victory. Very few people seem to have reflected that a different policy<br>might be appropriate at different periods of the war. The Anarchists probably<br>saved the situation in the first two months, but they were incapable of<br>organizing resistance beyond a certain point; the Communists probably saved the<br>situation in October-December, but to win the war outright was a different<br>matter. In England the Communist war-policy has been accepted without question,<br>because very few criticisms of it have been allowed to get into print and<br>because its general line--do away with revolutionary chaos, speed up<br>production, militarize the army--sounds realistic and efficient. It is worth<br>pointing out its inherent weakness.<br><br>In order to check every revolutionary tendency and make the war as much like<br>an ordinary war as possible, it became necessary to throw away the strategic<br>opportunities that actually existed. I have described how we were armed, or not<br>armed, on the Aragon front. There is very little doubt that arms were<br>deliberately withheld lest too many of them should get into the hands of the<br>Anarchists, who would afterwards use them for a revolutionary purpose;<br>consequently the big Aragon offensive which would have made Franco draw back<br>from Bilbao, and possibly from Madrid, never happened. But this was<br>comparatively a small matter. What was more important was that once the war had<br>been narrowed down to a 'war for democracy' it became impossible to make any<br>large-scale appeal for working-class aid abroad. If we face facts we must admit<br>that the working class of the world has regarded the Spanish war with<br>detachment. Tens of thousands of individuals came to fight, but the tens of<br>millions behind them remained apathetic. During the first year of the war the<br>entire British public is thought to have subscribed to various 'aid Spain' funds<br>about a quarter of a million pounds--probably less than half of what they spend<br>in a single week on going to the pictures. The way in which the working class in<br>the democratic countries could really have helped her Spanish comrades was by<br>industrial action--strikes and boycotts. No such thing ever even began to<br>happen. The Labour and Communist leaders everywhere declared that it was<br>unthinkable; and no doubt they were right, so long as they were also shouting at<br>the tops of their voices that' red' Spain was not 'red'. Since 1914-18 'war for<br>democracy' has had a sinister sound. For years past the Communists themselves<br>had been teaching the militant workers in all countries that 'democracy' was a<br>polite name for capitalism. To say first 'Democracy is a swindle', and then<br>'Fight for democracy!' is not good tactics. If, with the huge prestige of Soviet<br>Russia behind them, they had appealed to the workers of the world in the name<br>not of 'democratic Spain', but of 'revolutionary Spain', it is hard to believe<br>that they would not have got a response.<br><br>But what was most important of all, with a non-revolutionary policy it was<br>difficult, if not impossible, to strike at Franco's rear. By the summer of 1937<br>Franco was controlling a larger population than the Government--much larger, if<br>one counts in the colonies--with about the same number of troops. As everyone<br>knows, with a hostile population at your back it is impossible to keep an army<br>in the field without an equally large army to guard your communications,<br>suppress sabotage, etc. Obviously, therefore, there was no real popular movement<br>in Franco's rear. It was inconceivable that the people in his territory, at any<br>rate the town-workers and the poorer peasants, liked or wanted Franco, but with<br>every swing to the Right the Government's superiority became less apparent. What<br>clinches everything is the case of Morocco. Why was there no rising in Morocco?<br>Franco was trying to set up an infamous dictatorship, and the Moors actually<br>preferred him to the Popular Front Government! The palpable truth is that no<br>attempt was made to foment a rising in Morocco, because to do so would have<br>meant putting a revolutionary construction on the war. The first necessity, to<br>convince the Moors of the Government's good faith, would have been to proclaim<br>Morocco liberated. And we can imagine how pleased the French would have been by<br>that! The best strategic opportunity of the war was flung away in the vain hope<br>of placating French and British capitalism. The whole tendency of the Communist<br>policy was to reduce the war to an ordinary, non-revolutionary war in which the<br>Government was heavily handicapped. For a war of that kind has got to be won by<br>mechanical means, i.e. ultimately, by limitless supplies of weapons; and the<br>Government's chief donor of weapons, the U.S.S.R., was at a great disadvantage,<br>geographically, compared with Italy and Germany. Perhaps the P.O.U.M. and<br>Anarchist slogan: 'The war and the revolution are inseparable', was less<br>visionary than it sounds.<br><br>I have given my reasons for thinking that the Communist anti--revolutionary<br>policy was mistaken, but so far as its effect upon the war goes I do not hope<br>that my judgement is right. A thousand times I hope that it is wrong. I would<br>wish to see this war won by any means whatever. And of course we cannot tell yet<br>what may happen. The Government may swing to the Left again, the Moors may<br>revolt of their own accord, England may decide to buy Italy out, the war may be<br>won by straightforward military means--there is no knowing. I let the above<br>opinions stand, and time will show how far I am right or wrong.<br><br>But in February 193^ I did not see things quite in this light. I was sick of<br>the inaction on the Aragon front and chiefly conscious that I had not done my<br>fair share of the fighting. I used to think of the recruiting poster in<br>Barcelona which demanded accusingly of passers-by: 'What have you done for<br>democracy ?' and feel that I could only answer:' I have drawn my rations.' When<br>I joined the militia I had promised myself to kill one Fascist--after all, if<br>each of us killed one they would soon be extinct--and I had killed nobody yet,<br>had hardly had the chance to do so. And of course I wanted to go to Madrid.<br>Everyone in the army, whatever his political opinions, always wanted to go to<br>Madrid. This would probably mean exchanging into the International Column, for<br>the P.O.U.M. had now very few troops at Madrid and the Anarchists not so many as<br>formerly.<br><br>For the present, of course, one had to stay in the line, but I told everyone<br>that when we went on leave I should, if possible, exchange into the<br>International Column, which meant putting myself under Communist control.<br>Various people tried to dissuade me, but no one attempted to interfere. It is<br>fair to say that there was very little heresy-hunting in the P.O.U.M., perhaps<br>not enough, considering their special circumstances; short of being a<br>pro-Fascist no one was penalized for holding the wrong political opinions. I<br>spent much of my time in the militia in bitterly criticizing the P.O.U.M.<br>'line', but I never got into trouble for it. There was not even any pressure<br>upon one to become a political member of the party, though I think the majority<br>of the militiamen did so. I myself never joined the party--for which<br>afterwards, when the P.O.U.M. was suppressed, I was rather sorry.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/3.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/5.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
