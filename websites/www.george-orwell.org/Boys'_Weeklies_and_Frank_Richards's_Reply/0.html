<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">You never walk far through any poor quarter in any big town without<br>coming upon a small newsagent's shop. The general appearance of these<br>shops is always very much the same: a few posters for the DAILY MAIL and<br>the NEWS OF THE WORLD outside, a poky little window with sweet-bottles<br>and packets of Players, and a dark interior smelling of liquorice<br>allsorts and festooned from floor to ceiling with vilely printed twopenny<br>papers, most of them with lurid cover-illustrations in three colours.<br><br>Except for the daily and evening papers, the stock of these shops hardly<br>overlaps at all with that of the big news-agents. Their main selling line<br>is the twopenny weekly, and the number and variety of these are almost<br>unbelievable. Every hobby and pastime--cage-birds, fretwork,<br>carpentering, bees, carrier-pigeons, home conjuring, philately, chess--<br>has at least one paper devoted to it, and generally several. Gardening<br>and livestock-keeping must have at least a score between them. Then there<br>are the sporting papers, the radio papers, the children's comics, the<br>various snippet papers such as TIT-BITS, the large range of papers<br>devoted to the movies and all more or less exploiting women's legs, the<br>various trade papers, the women's story-papers (the ORACLE, SECRETS,<br>PEG'S PAPER, etc. etc.), the needlework papers--these so numerous that a<br>display of them alone will often fill an entire window--and in addition<br>the long series of 'Yank Mags' (FIGHT STORIES, ACTION STORIES, WESTERN<br>SHORT STORIES, etc.), which are imported shop-soiled from America and<br>sold at twopence halfpenny or threepence. And the periodical proper<br>shades off into the fourpenny novelette, the ALDINE BOXING NOVELS, the<br>BOYS' FRIEND LIBRARY, the SCHOOLGIRLS' OWN LIBRARY and many others.<br><br>Probably the contents of these shops is the best available indication of<br>what the mass of the English people really feels and thinks. Certainly<br>nothing half so revealing exists in documentary form. Best-seller novels,<br>for instance, tell one a great deal, but the novel is aimed almost<br>exclusively at people above the £4-a-week level. The movies are probably<br>a very unsafe guide to popular taste, because the film industry is<br>virtually a monopoly, which means that it is not obliged to study its<br>public at all closely. The same applies to some extent to the daily<br>papers, and most of all to the radio. But it does not apply to the weekly<br>paper with a smallish circulation and specialized subject-matter. Papers<br>like the EXCHANGE AND MART, for instance, or CAGE-BIRDS, or the ORACLE,<br>or the PREDICTION, or the MATRIMONIAL TIMES, only exist because there is<br>a definite demand for them, and they reflect the minds of their readers<br>as a great national daily with a circulation of millions cannot possibly<br>do.<br><br>Here I am only dealing with a single series of papers, the boys' twopenny<br>weeklies, often inaccurately described as 'penny dreadfuls'. Falling<br>strictly within this class there are at present ten papers, the GEM,<br>MAGNET, MODERN BOY, TRIUMPH and CHAMPION, all owned by the Amalgamated<br>Press, and the WIZARD, ROVER, SKIPPER, HOTSPUR and ADVENTURE, all owned<br>by D. C. Thomson & Co. What the circulations of these papers are, I do<br>not know. The editors and proprietors refuse to name any figures, and in<br>any case the circulation of a paper carrying serial stories is bound to<br>fluctuate widely. But there is no question that the combined public of<br>the ten papers is a very large one. They are on sale in every town in<br>England, and nearly every boy who reads at all goes through a phase of<br>reading one or more of them. The GEM and MAGNET, which are much the<br>oldest of these papers, are of rather different type from the rest, and<br>they have evidently lost some of their popularity during the past few<br>years. A good many boys now regard them as old fashioned and 'slow'.<br>Nevertheless I want to discuss them first, because they are more<br>interesting psychologically than the others, and also because the mere<br>survival of such papers into the nineteen-thirties is a rather startling<br>phenomenom.<br><br>The GEM and MAGNET are sister-papers (characters out of one paper<br>frequently appear in the other), and were both started more than thirty<br>years ago. At that time, together with Chums and the old B[oy's] O[wn]<br>P[aper], they were the leading papers for boys, and they remained dominant<br>till quite recently. Each of them carries every week a fifteen--or<br>twenty-thousand-word school story, complete in itself, but usually more<br>or less connected with the story of the week before. The Gem in addition<br>to its school story carries one or more adventure serial. Otherwise the<br>two papers are so much alike that they can be treated as one, though the<br>MAGNET has always been the better known of the two, probably because it<br>possesses a really first-rate character in the fat boy. Billy Bunter.<br><br>The stories are stories of what purports to be public-school life, and<br>the schools (Greyfriars in the MAGNET and St Jim's in the GEM) are<br>represented as ancient and fashionable foundations of the type of Eton or<br>Winchester. All the leading characters are fourth-form boys aged fourteen<br>or fifteen, older or younger boys only appearing in very minor parts.<br>Like Sexton Blake and Nelson Lee, these boys continue week after week and<br>year after year, never growing any older. Very occasionally a new boy<br>arrives or a minor character drops out, but in at any rate the last<br>twenty-five years the personnel has barely altered. All the principal<br>characters in both papers--Bob Cherry, Tom Merry, Harry Wharton, Johnny<br>Bull, Billy Bunter and the rest of them--were at Greyfriars or St Jim's<br>long before the Great War, exactly the same age as at present, having<br>much the same kind of adventures and talking almost exactly the same<br>dialect. And not only the characters but the whole atmosphere of both Gem<br>and Magnet has been preserved unchanged, partly by means of very<br>elaborate stylization. The stories in the Magnet are signed 'Frank<br><br>Richards' and those in the GEM, 'Martin Clifford', but a series lasting<br>thirty years could hardly be the work of the same person every week.<br>Consequently they have to be written in a style that is<br>easily imitated--an extraordinary, artificial, repetitive style, quite<br>different from anything else now existing in English literature. A couple<br>of extracts will do as illustrations. Here is one from the MAGNET:<br><br>Groan!<br><br>'Shutup, Bunter!'<br><br>Groan!<br><br>Shutting up was not really in Billy Bunter's line. He seldom shut up,<br>though often requested to do so. On the present awful occasion the fat<br>Owl of Greyfriars was less inclined than ever to shut up. And he did not<br>shut up! He groaned, and groaned, and went on groaning.<br><br>Even groaning did not fully express Bunter's feelings. His feelings, in<br>fact, were inexpressible.<br><br>There were six of them in the soup! Only one of the six uttered sounds of<br>woe and lamentation. But that one, William George Buntcr, uttered enough<br>for the whole party and a little over.<br><br>Harry Wharton & Go. stood in a wrathy and worried group. They were landed<br>and stranded, diddled, dished and done! etc., etc., etc.<br><br><br>Here is one from the Gem:<br><br><br>'Oh cwumbsl'<br><br>'Oh gum!'<br><br>'Oooogh!'<br><br>'Urrggh!'<br><br>Arthur Augustus sat up dizzily. He grabbed his handkerchief and pressed<br>it to his damaged nose. Tom Merry sat up, gasping for breath. They looked<br>at one another.<br><br>'Bai Jove! This is a go, deah boy!' gurgled Arthur Augustus. 'I have been<br>thwown into quite a fluttah! Oogh! The wottahsl The wuffians! The feahful<br>outsidahs! Wow!' etc., etc., etc.<br><br><br>Both of these extracts are entirely typical: you would find something<br>like them in almost every chapter of every number, to-day or twenty-five<br>years ago. The first thing that anyone would notice is the extraordinary<br>amount of tautology (the first of these two passages contains a hundred<br>and twenty-five words and could be compressed into about thirty),<br>seemingly designed to spin out the story, but actually playing its part<br>in creating the atmosphere. For the same reason various facetious<br>expressions are repeated over and over again; 'wrathy', for instance, is<br>a great favourite, and so is 'diddled, dished and done'. 'Oooogh!',<br>'Grooo!' and 'Yaroo!' (stylized cries of pain) recur constantly, and so<br>does 'Ha! ha! ha!', always given a line to itself, so that sometimes a<br>quarter of a column or there-abouts consists of 'Ha! ha! ha!' The slang<br>('Go and cat coke!', 'What the thump!', 'You frabjous ass!', etc. etc.)<br>has never been altered, so that the boys are now using slang which is at<br>least thirty years out of date. In addition, the various nicknames are<br>rubbed in on every possible occasion. Every few lines we are reminded<br>that Harry Wharton & Co. are 'the Famous Five', Bunter is always 'the fat<br>Owl' or 'the Owl of the Remove', Vernon-Smith is always 'the Bounder of<br>Greyfriars', Gussy (the Honourable Arthur Augustus D'Arcy) is always 'the<br>swell of St Jim's', and so on and so forth. There is a constant, untiring<br>effort to keep the atmosphere intact and to make sure that every new<br>reader learns immediately who is who. The result has been to make<br>Greyfriars and St Jim's into an extraordinary little world of their own,<br>a world which cannot be taken seriously by anyone over fifteen, but which<br>at any rate is not easily forgotten. By a debasement of the Dickens<br>technique a series of stereotyped 'characters' has been built up, in<br>several cases very successfully. Billy Bunter, for instance, must be one<br>of the best-known figures in English fiction; for the mere number of<br>people who know him he ranks with Sexton Blake, Tarzan, Sherlock Holmes<br>and a handful of characters in Dickens.<br><br>Needless to say, these stories are fantastically unlike life at a real<br>public school. They run in cycles of rather differing types, but in<br>general they are the clean-fun, knock-about type of story, with interest<br>centring round horseplay, practical jokes, ragging roasters, fights,<br>canings, football, cricket and food. A constantly recurring story is one<br>in which a boy is accused of some misdeed committed by another and is too<br>much of a sportsman to reveal the truth. The 'good' boys are 'good' in<br>the clean-living Englishman tradition--they keep in hard training, wash<br>behind their ears, never hit below the belt etc., etc.,--and by way of<br>contrast there is a series of'bad' boys, Racke, Crooke, Loder and others,<br>whose badness consists in betting, smoking cigarettes and frequenting<br>public-houses. All these boys are constantly on the verge of expulsion,<br>but as it would mean a change of personnel if any boy were actually<br>expelled, no one is ever caught out in any really serious offence.<br>Stealing, for instance, barely enters as a motif. Sex is completely<br>taboo, especially in the form in which it actually arises at public<br>schools. Occasionally girls enter into the stories, and very rarely there<br>is something approaching a mild flirtation, but it is entirely in the<br>spirit of clean fun. A boy and a girl enjoy going for bicycle rides<br>together--that is all it ever amounts to. Kissing, for instance, would<br>be regarded as 'soppy'. Even the bad boys are presumed to be completely<br>sexless. When the GEM and MAGNET were started, it is probable that there<br>was a deliberate intention to get away from the guilty sex-ridden<br>atmosphere that pervaded so much of the earlier literature for boys. In<br>the nineties the BOYS' OWN PAPEr, for instance, used to have its<br>correspondence columns full of terrifying warnings against masturbation,<br>and books like ST WINIFRED'S and TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL-DAYS were heavy with<br>homosexual feeling, though no doubt the authors were not fully aware of<br>it. In the GEM and MAGNET sex simply does not exist as a problem.<br>Religion is also taboo; in the whole thirty years' issue of the two<br>papers the word 'God' probably does not occur, except in 'God save the<br>King'. On the other hand, there has always been a very strong<br>'temperance' strain. Drinking and, by association, smoking are regarded<br>as rather disgraceful even in an adult ('shady' is the usual word), but<br>at the same time as something irresistibly fascinating, a sort of<br>substitute for sex. In their moral atmosphere the GEM and MAGNET have a<br>great deal in common with the Boy Scout movement, which started at about<br>the same time.<br><br>All literature of this kind is partly plagiarism. Sexton Blake, for<br>instance, started off quite frankly as an imitation of Sherlock Holmes,<br>and still resembles him fairly strongly; he has hawk-like features, lives<br>in Baker Street, smokes enormously and puts on a dressing-gown when he<br>wants to think. The GEM and MAGNET probably owe something to the old<br>school-story writers who were flourishing when they began, Gunby Hadath,<br>Desmond Coke and the rest, but they owe more to nineteenth-century<br>models. In so far as Greyfriars and St Jim's are like real schools at<br>all, they are much more like Tom Brown's Rugby than a modern public<br>school. Neither school has an O.T.G., for instance, games are not<br>compulsory, and the boys are even allowed to wear what clothes they like.<br>But without doubt the main origin of these papers is STALKY & CO. This<br>book has had an immense influence on boys' literature, and it is one of<br>those books which have a sort of traditional reputation among people who<br>have never even seen a copy of it. More than once in boys' weekly papers<br>I have come across a reference to STALKY & CO. in which the word was<br>spelt 'Storky'. Even the name of the chief comic among the Greyfriars<br>masters, Mr Prout, is taken from STALKY & CO., and so is much of the<br>slang; 'jape', 'merry','giddy', 'bizney' (business), 'frabjous', 'don't'<br>for 'doesn't'--all of them out of date even when GEM and MAGNET started.<br>There are also traces of earlier origins. The name 'Greyfriars' is<br>probably taken from Thackeray, and Gosling, the school porter in the<br>MAGNET, talks in an imitation of Dickens's dialect.<br><br>With all this, the supposed 'glamour' of public-school life is played for<br>all it is worth. There is all the usual para-phernalia--lock-up,<br>roll-call, house matches, fagging, prefects, cosy teas round the study<br>fire, etc. etc.--and constant reference to the 'old school', the 'old<br>grey stones' (both schools were founded in the early sixteenth century),<br>the 'team spirit' of the 'Greyfriars men'. As for the snob-appeal, it is<br>completely shameless. Each school has a titled boy or two whose titles<br>are constantly thrust in the reader's face; other boys have the names of<br>well-known aristocratic families, Talbot, Manners, Lowther. We are for<br>ever being reminded that Gussy is the Honourable Arthur A. D'Arcy, son of<br>Lord Eastwood, that Jack Blake is heir to 'broad acres', that Hurree<br>Jamset Ram Singh (nicknamed Inky) is the Nabob of Bhanipur, that<br>Vernon-Smith's father is a millionaire. Till recently the illustrations<br>in both papers always depicted the boys in clothes imitated from those of<br>Eton; in the last few years Greyfriars has changed over to blazers and<br>flannel trousers, but St Jim's still sticks to the Eton jacket, and Gussy<br>sticks to his top-hat. In the school magazine which appears every week as<br>part of the MAGNET, Harry Wharton writes an article discussing the<br>pocket-money received by the 'fellows in the Remove', and reveals that<br>some of them get as much as five pounds a week! This kind of thing is a<br>perfectly deliberate incitement to wealth-fantasy. And here it is worth<br>noticing a rather curious fact, and that is that the school story is a<br>thing peculiar to England. So far as I know, there are extremely few<br>school stories in foreign languages. The reason, obviously, is that in<br>England education is mainly a matter of status. The most definite<br>dividing line between the petite-bourgeoisie and the working class is<br>that the former pay for their education, and within the bourgeoisie there<br>is another unbridgeable gulf between the 'public' school and the<br>'private' school. It is quite clear that there are tens and scores of<br>thousands of people to whom every detail of life at a 'posh' public<br>school is wildly thrilling and romantic. They happen to be outside that<br>mystic world of quad-rangles and house-colours, but they can yearn after<br>it, day-dream about it, live mentally in it for hours at a stretch. The<br>question is, Who arc these people? Who reads the GEM and MAGNET?<br><br>Obviously one can never be quite certain about this kind of thing. All I<br>can say from my own observation is this. Boys who are likely to go to<br>public schools themselves generally read the GEM and MAGNET, but they<br>nearly always stop reading them when they are about twelve; they may<br>continue for another year from force of habit, but by that time they have<br>ceased to take them seriously. On the other hand, the boys at very cheap<br>private schools, the schools that are designed for people who can't<br>afford a public school but consider the Council schools 'common',<br>continue reading the GEM and MAGNET for several years longer. A few years<br>ago I was a teacher at two of these schools myself. I found that not only<br>did virtually all the boys read the GEM and MAGNET, but that they were<br>still taking them fairly seriously when they were fifteen or even<br>sixteen. These boys were the sons of shopkeepers, office employees and<br>small business and professional men, and obviously it is this class that<br>the GEM and MAGNET are aimed at. But they are certainly read by<br>working-class boys as well. They are generally on sale in the poorest<br>quarters of big towns, and I have known them to be read by boys whom one<br>might expect to be completely immune from public-school 'glamour'. I have<br>seen a young coal miner, for instance, a lad who had already worked a<br>year or two underground, eagerly reading the GEM. Recently I offered a<br>batch of English papers to some British legionaries of the French Foreign<br>Legion in North Africa; they picked out the GEM and MAGNET first. Both<br>papers are much read by girls, and the Pen Pals department<br>of the GEM shows that it is read in every corner of the British Empire, by<br>Australians, Canadians, Palestine Jews, Malays, Arabs, Straits Chinese,<br>etc., etc. The editors evidently expect their readers to be aged round<br>about fourteen, and the advertisements (milk chocolate, postage stamps,<br>water pistols, blushing cured, home conjuring tricks, itching powder, the<br>Phine Phun Ring which runs a needle into your friend's hand, etc., etc.)<br>indicate roughly the same age; there are also the Admiralty<br>advertisements, however, which call for youths between seventeen and<br>twenty-two. And there is no question that these papers are also read by<br>adults. It is quite common for people to write to the editor and say that<br>they have read every number of the GEM or MAGNET for the past thirty<br>years. Here, for instance, is a letter from a lady in Salisbury:<br><br>I can say of your splendid yams of Harry Wharton & Co. of Greyfriars,<br>that they never fail to reach a high standard. Without doubt they are the<br>finest stories of their type on the market to-day, which is saying a good<br>deal. They seem to bring you face to face with Nature. I have taken the<br>Magnet from the start, and have followed the adventures of Harry Wharton<br>& Co. with rapt interest. I have no sons, but two daughters, and there's<br>always a rush to be the first to read the grand old paper. My husband,<br>too, was a staunch reader of the Magnet until he was suddenly taken away<br>from us.<br><br><br>It is well worth getting hold of some copies of the GEM and MAGNET,<br>especially the GEM, simply to have a look at the correspondence columns.<br>What is truly startling is the intense interest with which the pettiest<br>details of life at Greyfriars and St Jim's are followed up. Here, for<br>instance, are a few of the questions sent in by readers:<br><br><br>What age is Dick Roylance?' 'How old is St Jim's?' 'Can you give me a<br>list of the Shell and their studies?' 'How much did D'Arcy's monocle<br>cost?' 'How is it that fellows like Crooke are in the Shell and decent<br>fellows like yourself are only in the Fourth?' 'What arc the Form<br>captain's three chief duties?' 'Who is the chemistry master at St Jim's?'<br>(From a girl) 'Where is St Jim's situated? COULD you tell me how to get<br>there, as I would love to sec the building? Are you boys just "phoneys",<br>as I think you are?'<br><br><br>It is clear that many of the boys and girls who write these letters are<br>living a complete fantasy-life. Sometimes a boy will write, for instance,<br>giving his age, height, weight, chest and bicep measurements and asking<br>which member of the Shell or Fourth Form he most exactly resembles. The<br>demand for a list of the studies on the Shell passage, with an exact<br>account of who lives in each, is a very common one. The editors, of<br>course, do everything in their power to keep up the illusion. In the GEM<br>Jack Blake is supposed to write answers to correspondents, and in the<br>MAGNET a couple of pages is always given up to the school magazine (the<br>GREYFRIARS HERALD, edited by Harry Wharton), and there is another page<br>in which one or other character is written up each week. The stories run<br>in cycles, two or three characters being kept in the foreground for<br>several weeks at a time. First there will be a series of rollicking<br>adventure stories, featuring the Famous Five and Billy Bunter; then a run<br>of stories turning on mistaken identity, with Wibley (the make-up wizard)<br>in the star part; then a run of more serious stories in which<br>Vernon-Smith is trembling on the verge of expulsion. And here one comes<br>upon the real secret of the GEM and MAGNET and the probable reason why<br>they continue to be read in spite of their obvious out-of-dateness.<br><br>It is that the characters are so carefully graded as to give almost every<br>type of reader a character he can identify himself with. Most boys'<br>papers aim at doing this, hence the boy-assistant (Sexton Blake's Tinker,<br>Nelson Lee's Nipper, etc.) who usually accompanies the explorer,<br>detective or what-not on his adventures. But in these cases there is only<br>one boy, and usually it is much the same type of boy. hi the GEM and<br>MAGNET there is a model for very nearly everybody. There is the normal<br>athletic, high-spirited boy (Tom Merry, Jack Blake, Frank Nugent), a<br>slightly rowdier version of this type (Bob Cherry), a more aristocratic<br>version (Talbot, Manners), a quieter, more serious version (Harry<br>Wharton), and a stolid, 'bulldog' version (Johnny Bull). Then there is<br>the reckless, dare-devil type of boy (Vernon-Smith), the definitely<br>'clever', studious boy (Mark Linley, Dick Penfold), and the eccentric boy<br>who is not good at games but possesses some special talent (Skinner<br>Wibley). And there is the scholarship-boy (Tom Redwing), an important<br>figure in this class of story because he makes it possible for boys from<br>very poor homes to project themselves into the public-school atmosphere.<br>In addition there are Australian, Irish, Welsh, Manx, Yorkshire and<br>Lancashire boys to play upon local patriotism. But the subtlety of<br>characterization goes deeper than this. If one studies the correspondence<br>columns one sees that there is probably NO character in the GEM and<br>MAGNET whom some or other reader does not identify with, except the<br>out-and-out comics, Coker, Billy Bunter, Fisher T. Fish (the<br>money-grabbing American boy) and, of course, the masters. Bunter, though<br>in his origin he probably owed something to the fat boy in PICKWICK, is a<br>real creation. His tight trousers against which boots and canes are<br>constantly thudding, his astuteness in search of food, his postal order<br>which never turns up, have made him famous wherever the Union Jack waves.<br>But he is not a subject for day-dreams. On the other hand, another<br>seeming figure of fun, Gussy (the Honourable Arthur A. D'Arcy, 'the swell<br>of St Jim's'), is evidently much admired. Like everything else in the GEM<br>and MAGNET, Gussy is at least thirty years out of date. He is the 'knut'<br>of the early twentieth century or even the 'masher' of the nineties ('Bai<br>Jove, deah boy!' and 'Weally, I shall be obliged to give you a feahful<br>thwashin'!'), the monocled idiot who made good on the fields of Mons and<br>Le Gateau. And his evident popularity goes to show how deep the<br>snob-appeal of this type is. English people are extremely fond of the<br>titled ass (cf. Lord Peter Wimscy) who always turns up trumps in the<br>moment of emergency. Here is a letter from one of Gussy's girl admirers;<br><br>I think you're too hard on Gussy. I wonder he's still In existence, the<br>way you treat him. He's my hero. Did you know I write lyrics? How's this<br>--to the tune of'Goody Goody'?<br><br>Gonna get my gas-mask, join the ARP.<br>'Cos I'm wise to all those bombs you drop on me.<br>Gonna dig myself a trench<br>Inside the garden fence;<br>Gonna seal my windows up with tin<br>So the tear gas can't get in;<br>Gonna park my cannon right outside the kerb<br>With a note to Adolf Hitler: 'Don't disturb!'<br>And if I never fall in Nazi hands<br>That's soon enough for me<br>Gonna get my gas-mask, join the ARP.<br><br>P.S.--Do you get on well with girls?<br><br><br>I quote this in full because (dated April 1939) it is interesting as<br>being probably the earliest mention of Hitler in the GEM. In the GEM<br>there is also a heroic fat boy. Fatty Wynn, as a set-off against Bunter.<br>Vernon-Smith, 'the Bounder of the Remove', a Byronic character, always on<br>the verge of the sack, is another great favourite. And even some of the<br>cads probably have their following. Loder, for instance, 'the rotter of<br>the Sixth', is a cad, but he is also a highbrow and given to saying<br>sarcastic things about football and the team spirit. The boys of the<br>Remove only think him all the more of a cad for this, but a certain type<br>of boy would probably identify with him. Even Racke, Grooke & Co. are<br>probably admired by small boys who think it diabolically wicked to smoke<br>cigarettes. (A frequent question in the correspondence column; 'What<br>brand of cigarettes does Racke smoke?')<br><br>Naturally the politics of the GEM and MAGNET are Conservative, but in a<br>completely pre-1914 style, with no Fascist tinge. In reality their basic<br>political assumptions are two: nothing ever changes, and foreigners are<br>funny. In the GEM of 1939 Frenchmen are still Froggies and Italians are<br>still Dagoes. Mossoo, the French master at Greyfriars, is the usual<br>comic-paper Frog, with pointed beard, pegtop trousers, etc. Inky, the<br>Indian boy, though a rajah, and therefore possessing snob-appeal, is also<br>the comic babu of the PUNCH tradition. ("The rowfulness is not the<br>proper caper, my esteemed Bob," said Inky. "Let dogs delight in the<br>barkfulness and bitefulness, but the soft answer is the cracked pitcher<br>that goes longest to a bird in the bush, as the English proverb remarks.")<br>Fisher T. Fish is the old-style stage Yankee ("Waal, I guess", etc.)<br>dating from a peroid of Anglo-American jealousy. Wun Lung, the<br>Chinese boy (he has rather faded out of late, no doubt because some of<br>the MAGNET'S readers are Straits Chinese), is the nineteenth-century<br>pantomime Chinaman, with saucer-shaped hat, pigtail and pidgin-English.<br>The assumption all along is not only that foreigners are comics who are<br>put there for us to laugh at, but that they can be classified in much the<br>same way as insects. That is why in all boys' papers, not only the GEM<br>and MAGNET, a Chinese is invariably portrayed with a pigtail. It is the<br>thing you recognize him by, like the Frenchman's beard or the Italian's<br>barrel-organ. In papers of this kind it occasionally happens that when<br>the setting of a story is in a foreign country some attempt is made to<br>describe the natives as individual human beings, but as a rule it is<br>assumed that foreigners of any one race are all alike and will conform<br>more or less exactly to the following patterns:<br><br><br>FRENCHMAN: Excitable. Wears beard, gesticulates wildly.<br>SPANIARD, Mexican, etc.: Sinister, treacherous.<br>ARAB, Afghan, etc.: Sinister, treacherous.<br>CHINESE: Sinister, treacherous. Wears pigtail.<br>ITALIAN: Excitable. Grinds barrel-organ or carries stiletto.<br>SWEDE, Dane, etc.: Kind-hearted, stupid.<br>NEGRO: Comic, very faithful.<br><br><br>The working classes only enter into the GEM and MAGNET as comics or<br>semi-villains (race-course touts, etc.). As for class-friction, trade<br>unionism, strikes, slumps, unemployment, Fascism and civil war--not a<br>mention. Somewhere or other in the thirty years' issue of the two papers<br>you might perhaps find the word 'Socialism', but you would have to look a<br>long time for it. If the Russian Revolution is anywhere referred to, it<br>will be indirectly, in the word 'Bolshy' (meaning a person of violent<br>disagreeable habits). Hitler and the Nazis are just beginning to make<br>their appearance, in the sort of reference I quoted above. The war-crisis<br>of September 1938 made just enough impression to produce a story in which<br>Mr Vernon-Smith, the Bounder's millionaire father, cashed in on the<br>general panic by buying up country houses in order to sell them to 'crisis<br>scuttlers'. But that is probably as near to noticing the European situation<br>as the GEM and MAGNET will come, until the war actually starts. <br>That does not mean that these papers are unpatriotic--quite the<br>contrary! Throughout the Great War the GEM and MAGNET were perhaps the<br>most consistently and cheerfully patriotic papers in England. Almost<br>every week the boys caught a spy or pushed a conchy into the army, and<br>during the rationing period 'EAT LESS BREAD' was printed in large type on<br>every page. But their patriotism has nothing whatever to do with<br>power-politics or 'ideological' warfare. It is more akin to family<br>loyalty, and actually it gives one a valuable clue to the attitude of<br>ordinary people, especially the huge untouched block of the middle class<br>and the better-off working class. These people are patriotic to the<br>middle of their bones, but they do not feel that what happens in foreign<br>countries is any of their business. When England is in danger they rally<br>to its defence as a matter of course, but in between-times they are not<br>interested. After all, England is always in the right and England always<br>wins, so why worry? It is an attitude that has been shaken during the<br>past twenty years, but not so deeply as is sometimes supposed. Failure to<br>understand it is one of the reasons why Left Wing political parties are<br>seldom able to produce an acceptable foreign policy.<br><br>The mental world of the GEM and MAGNET, therefore, is something like<br>this:<br><br>The year is 1910--or 1940, but it is all the same. You are at<br>Greyfriars, a rosy-cheeked boy of fourteen in posh tailor-made clothes,<br>sitting down to tea in your study on the Remove passage after an exciting<br>game of football which was won by an odd goal in the last half-minute.<br>There is a cosy fire in the study, and outside the wind is whistling. The<br>ivy clusters thickly round the old grey stones. The King is on his throne<br>and the pound is worth a pound. Over in Europe the comic foreigners are<br>jabbering and gesticulating, but the grim grey battleships of the British<br>Fleet are steaming up the Channel and at the outposts of Empire the<br>monocled Englishmen are holding the niggers at bay. Lord Mauleverer has<br>just got another fiver and we are all settling down to a tremendous tea<br>of sausages, sardines, crumpets, potted meat, jam and doughnuts. After<br>tea we shall sit round the study fire having a good laugh at Billy Bunter<br>and discussing the team for next week's match against Rook-wood.<br>Everything is safe, solid and unquestionable. Everything will be the<br>samefor ever and ever. That approximately is the atmosphere.<br><br>But now turn from the GEM and MAGNET to the more up-to-date papers which<br>have appeared since the Great War. The truly significant thing is that<br>they have more points of resemblance to the GEM and MAGNET than points of<br>difference. But it is better to consider the differences first.<br><br>There are eight of these newer papers, the MODEM BOY, TRIUMPH, CHAMPION,<br>WIZARD, ROVER, SKIPPER, HOTSPUR and ADVENTURE. All of these have appeared<br>since the Great War, but except for the MODERN BOY none of them is less<br>than five years old. Two papers which ought also to be mentioned briefly<br>here; though they are not strictly in the same class as the rest, are the<br>DETECTIVE WEEKLY and the THRILLER, both owned by the Amalgamated Press.<br>The DETECTIVE WEEKLY has taken over Sexton Blake. Both of these papers<br>admit a certain amount of sex-interest into their stories, and though<br>certainly read by boys; they are not aimed at them exclusively. All the<br>others are boys' papers pure and simple, and they are sufficiently alike<br>to be considered together. There does not seem to be any notable<br>difference between Thomson's publications and those of the Amalgamated<br>Press.<br><br>As soon. as one looks at these papers one sees their technical<br>superiority to the GEM and MAGNET. To begin with, they have the great<br>advantage of not being written entirely by one person. Instead of one<br>long complete story, a number of the WIZARD or HOTSPUR consists of half a<br>dozen or more serials, none of which goes on for ever. Consequently there<br>is far more variety and far less padding, and none of the tiresome<br>stylization and facetiousness of the GEM and MAGNET. Look at these two<br>extracts, for example:<br><br><br>Billy Bunter groaned.<br><br>A quarter of an hour had elapsed out of the two hours that Bunter was<br>booked for extra French.<br><br>In a quarter of an hour there were only fifteen minutes! But every one of<br>those minutes seemed inordinately long to Bunter. They seemed to crawl by<br>like tired snails.<br><br>Looking at the clock in Classroom No. 10 the fat Owl could hardly believe<br>that only fifteen minutes had passed. It seemed more like fifteen hours,<br>if not fifteen days!<br><br>Other fellows were in extra French as well as Bunter. They did not<br>matter. Bunter did! (The Magnet)<br><br>* * *<br><br>After a terrible climb, hacking out handholds in the smooth ice every<br>step of the way up. Sergeant Lionheart Logan of the Mounties was now<br>clinging like a human fly to the face of an icy cliff, as smooth and<br>treacherous as a giant pane of glass.<br><br>An Arctic blizzard, in all its fury, was buffeting his body, driving the<br>blinding snow into his face, seeking to tear his fingers loose from their<br>handholds and dash him to death on the jagged boulders which lay at the<br>foot of the cliff a hundred feet below.<br><br>Crouching among those boulders were eleven villainous trappers who had<br>done their best to shoot down Lionheart and his companion, Constable Jim<br>Rogers--until the blizzard had blotted the two Mounties out of sight<br>from below. (The Wizard)<br><br><br>The second extract gets you some distance with the story, the first takes<br>a hundred words to tell you that Bunter is in the detention class.<br>Moreover, by not concentrating on school stories (in point of numbers the<br>school story slightly predominates in all these papers, except the<br>THRILLER and DETECTIVE WEEKLY), the WIZARD, HOTSPUR, etc., have far<br>greater opportunities for sensationalism. Merely looking at the cover<br>illustrations of the papers which I have on the table in front of me,<br>here are some of the things I see. On one a cowboy is clinging by his<br>toes to the wing of an aeroplane in mid-air and shooting down another<br>aeroplane with his revolver. On another a Chinese is swimming for his<br>life down a sewer with a swarm of ravenous-looking rats swimming after<br>him. On another an engineer is lighting a stick of dynamite while a steel<br>robot feels for him with its claws. On another a man in airman's costume<br>is fighting barehanded against a rat somewhat larger than a donkey. On<br>another a nearly naked man of terrific muscular development has just<br>seized a lion by the tail and flung it thirty yards over the wall of an<br>arena, with the words, 'Take back your blooming lion!' Clearly no school<br>story can compete with this kind of thing. From time to time the school<br>buildings may catch fire or the French master may turn out to be the head<br>of an international anarchist gang, but in a general way the interest<br>must centre round cricket, school rivalries, practical jokes, etc. There<br>is not much room for bombs, death-rays, sub-machine guns, aeroplanes,<br>mustangs, octopuses, grizzly bears or gangsters.<br><br>Examination of a large number of these papers shows that, putting aside<br>school stories, the favourite subjects are Wild West, Frozen North,<br>Foreign Legion, crime (always from the detective's angle), the Great War<br>(Air Force or Secret Service, not the infantry), the Tarzan motif in<br>varying forms, professional football, tropical exploration, historical<br>romance (Robin Hood, Cavaliers and Round-heads, etc.) and scientific<br>invention. The Wild West still leads, at any rate as a setting, though<br>the Red Indian seems to be fading out. The one theme that is really new<br>is the scientific one. Death-rays, Martians, invisible men, robots,<br>helicopters and interplanetary rockets figure largely: here and there<br>there are even far-off rumours of psychotherapy and ductless glands.<br>Whereas the GEM and MAGNET derive from Dickens and Kipling, the WIZARD,<br>CHAMPION, MODEM BOY, etc., owe a great deal to H. G. Wells, who, rather<br>than Jules Verne, is the father of 'Scientifiction'. Naturally it is the<br>magical Martian aspect of science that is most exploited, but one or two<br>papers include serious articles on scientific subjects, besides<br>quantities of informative snippets. (Examples: 'A Kauri tree in<br>Queensland, Australia, is over 12,000 years old'; 'Nearly 50,000<br>thunderstorms occur every day'; 'Helium gas costs £1 per 1000 cubic<br>feet'; 'There are over 500 varieties of spiders in Great Britain';<br>'London firemen use 14,000,000 gallons of water annually', etc., etc.)<br>There is a marked advance in intellectual curiosity and, on the whole, in<br>the demand made on the reader's attention. In practice the GEM and MAGNET<br>and the post-war papers are read by much the same public, but the mental<br>age aimed at seems to have risen by a year or two years--an improvement<br>probably corresponding to the improvement in elementary education since<br>1909.<br><br>The other thing that has emerged in the post-war boys' papers, though not<br>to anything like the extent one would expect, is bully-worship and the<br>cult of violence.<br><br>If one compares the GEM and MAGNET with a genuinely modern paper, the<br>thing that immediately strikes one is the absence of the leader-principle.<br>There is no central dominating character; instead there are fifteen<br>or twenty characters, all more or less on an equality, with whom<br>readers of different types can identify. In the more modem papers<br>this is not usually the case. Instead of identifying with a schoolboy of<br>more or less his own age, the reader of the SKIPPER, HOTSPUR, etc., is<br>led to identify with a G-man, with a Foreign Legionary, with some variant<br>of Tarzan, with an air ace, a master spy, an explorer, a pugilist--at<br>any rate with some single all-powerful character who dominates everyone<br>about him and whose usual method of solving any problem is a sock on the<br>jaw. This character is intended as a superman, and as physical strength<br>is the form of power that boys can best understand, he is usually a sort<br>of human gorilla; in the Tarzan type of story he is sometimes actually a<br>giant, eight or ten feet high. At the same time the scenes of violence in<br>nearly all these stories are remarkably harmless and unconvincing. There<br>is a great difference in tone between even the most bloodthirsty English<br>paper and the threepenny Yank Mags, FIGHT STORIES, ACTION STORIES, etc.<br>(not strictly boys' papers, but largely read by boys). In the Yank Mags<br>you get real blood-lust, really gory descriptions of the all-in,<br>jump-on-his-testicles style fighting, written in a jargon that has been<br>perfected by people who brood end-lessly on violence. A paper like FIGHT<br>STORIES, for instance, would have very little appeal except to sadists<br>and masochists. You can see the comparative gentleness of the English<br>civilization by the amateurish way in which prize-fighting is always<br>described in the boys' weeklies. There is no specialized vocabulary. Look<br>at these four extracts, two English, two American;<br><br><br>When the gong sounded, both men were breathing heavily and each had great<br>red marks on his chest. Bill's chin was bleeding, and Ben had a cut over<br>his right eye.<br><br>Into their corners they sank, but when the gong clanged again they were<br>up swiftly, and they went like tigers at each other. (ROVER)<br><br>* * *<br><br>He walked in stolidly and smashed a clublike right to my face. Blood<br>spattered and I went back on my heels, but surged in and ripped my right<br>under the heart. Another right smashed full on Ben's already battered<br>mouth, and, spitting out the fragments of a tooth, he crashed a flailing<br>left to my body. (FIGHT STORIES)<br><br>* * *<br><br>It was amazing to watch the Black Panther at work. His muscles rippled<br>and slid under his dark skin. There was all the power and grace of a<br>giant cat in his swift and terrible onslaught.<br><br>He volleyed blows with a bewildering speed for so huge a fellow. In a<br>moment Ben was simply blocking with his gloves as well as he could. Ben<br>was really a past-master of defence. He had many fine victories behind<br>him. But the Negro's rights and lefts crashed through openings that<br>hardly any other fighter could have found. (WIZARD)<br><br>* * *<br><br>Haymakers which packed the bludgeoning weight of forest monarchs crashing<br>down under the ax hurled into the bodies of the two heavies as they<br>swapped punches. (FIGHT STORIES)<br><br><br>Notice how much more knowledgeable the American extracts sound. They are<br>written for devotees of the prize-ring, the others are not. Also, it<br>ought to be emphasized that on its level the moral code of the English<br>boys' papers is a decent one. Crime and dishonesty are never held up to<br>admiration, there is none of the cynicism and corruption of the American<br>gangster story. The huge sale of the Yank Mags in England shows that<br>there is a demand for that kind of thing, but very few English writers<br>seem able to produce it. When hatred of Hitler became a major emotion in<br>America, it was interesting to see how promptly 'anti-Fascism' was<br>adapted to pornographic purposes by the editors of the Yank Mags. One<br>magazine which I have in front of me is given up to a long, complete<br>story, 'When Hell Game to America', in which the agents of a<br>'blood-maddened European dictator' are trying to conquer the U.S.A. with<br>death-rays and invisible aeroplanes. There is the frankest appeal to<br>sadism, scenes in which the Nazis tie bombs to women's backs and fling<br>them off heights to watch them blown to pieces in mid-air, others in<br>which they tie naked girls together by their hair and prod them with<br>knives to make them dance, etc., etc. The editor comments solemnly on all<br>this, and uses it as a plea for tightening up restrictions against<br>immigrants. On another page of the same paper: 'LIVES OF THE HOTCHA<br>CHORUS GIRLS. Reveals all the intimate secrets and fascinating pastimes<br>of the famous Broadway Hotcha girls. NOTHING IS OMITTED. Price 10c.' 'HOW<br>TO LOVE. 10c.' 'FRENCH PHOTO RING. 25c.' 'NAUGHTY NUDIES TRANSFERS. From<br>the outside of the glass you see a beautiful girl, innocently dressed.<br>Turn it around and look through the glass and oh! what a difference! Set<br>of 3 transfers 25c.,' etc., etc., etc. There is nothing at all like this<br>in any English paper likely to be read by boys. But the process of<br>Americanization is going on all the same. The American ideal, the<br>'he-man', the 'tough guy', the gorilla who puts everything right by<br>socking everybody on the jaw, now figures in probably a majority of boys'<br>papers. In one serial now running in the SKIPPER he is always portrayed<br>ominously enough, swinging a rubber truncheon.<br><br>The development of the WIZARD, HOTSPUR, etc., as against the earlier<br>boys' papers, boils down to this: better technique, more scientific<br>interest, more bloodshed, more leader-worship. But, after all, it is the<br>LACK of development that is the really striking thing.<br><br>To begin with, there is no political development whatever. The world of<br>the SKIPPER and the CHAMPION is still the pre-1914 world of the MAGNET<br>and the GEM. The Wild West story, for instance, with its cattle-rustlers,<br>lynch-law and other paraphernalia belonging to the eighties, is a<br>curiously archaic thing. It is worth noticing that in papers of this type<br>it is always taken for granted that adventures only happen at the ends of<br>the earth, in tropical forests, in Arctic wastes, in African deserts, on<br>Western prairies, in Chinese opium dens--everywhere in fact, except the<br>places where things really DO happen. That is a belief dating from thirty<br>or forty years ago, when the new continents were in process of being<br>opened up. Nowadays, of course, if you really want adventure, the place<br>to look for it is in Europe. But apart from the picturesque side of the<br>Great War, contemporary history is carefully excluded. And except that<br>Americans are now admired instead of being laughed at, foreigners are<br>exactly the same figures of fun that they always were. If a Chinese<br>character appears, he is still the sinister pigtailed opium-smuggler of<br>Sax Rohmer; no indication that things have been happening in China since<br>1912--no indication that a war is going on there, for instance. If a<br>Spaniard appears, he is still a 'dago' or 'greaser' who rolls cigarettes<br>and stabs people in the back; no indication that things have been<br>happening in Spain. Hitler and the Nazis have not yet appeared, or are<br>barely making their appearance. There will be plenty about them in a<br>little while, but it will be from a strictly patriotic angle (Britain<br>versus Germany), with the real meaning of the struggle kept out of sight<br>as much as possible. As for the Russian Revolution, it is extremely<br>difficult to find any reference to it in any of these papers. When Russia<br>is mentioned at all it is usually in an information snippet (example:<br>'There are 29,000 centenarians in the USSR.'), and any reference to<br>the Revolution is indirect and twenty years out of date. In one story in<br>the ROVER, for instance, somebody has a tame bear, and as it is a Russian<br>bear, it is nicknamed Trotsky--obviously an echo of the 1917-23 period<br>and not of recent controversies. The clock has stopped at 1910. Britannia<br>rules the waves, and no one has heard of slumps, booms, unemployment,<br>dictatorships, purges or concentration camps.<br><br>And in social outlook there is hardly any advance. The snobbishness is<br>somewhat less open than in the GEM and MAGNET--that is the most one can<br>possibly say. To begin with, the school story, always partly dependent on<br>snob-appeal, is by no means eliminated. Every number of a boys' paper<br>includes at least one school story, these stories slightly outnumbering<br>the Wild Westerns. The very elaborate fantasy-life of the GEM and MAGNET<br>is not imitated and there is more emphasis on extraneous adventure, but<br>the social atmosphere (old grey stones) is much the same. When a new<br>school is introduced at the beginning of a story we are often told in<br>just those words that 'it was a very posh school'. From time to time a<br>story appears which is ostensibly directed AGAINST snobbery. The<br>scholarship-boy (cf. Tom Redwing in the MAGNET) makes fairly frequent<br>appearances, and what is essentially the same theme is sometimes<br>presented in this form: there is great rivalry between two schools, one<br>of which considers itself more 'posh' than the other, and there are<br>fights, practical jokes, football matches, etc., always ending in the<br>discomfiture of the snobs. If one glances very superficially at some of<br>these stories it is possible to imagine that a democratic spirit has<br>crept into the boys' weeklies, but when one looks more closely one sees<br>that they merely reflect the bitter jealousies that exist within the<br>white-collar class. Their real function is to allow the boy who goes to a<br>cheap private school (NOT a Council school) to feel that his school is<br>just as 'posh' in the sight of God as Winchester or Eton. The sentiment<br>of school loyalty ('We're better than the fellows down the road'), a<br>thing almost unknown to the real working class, is still kept up. As<br>these stories are written by many different hands, they do, of course,<br>vary a good deal in tone. Some are reasonably free from snobbishness, in<br>others money and pedigree are exploited even more shamelessly than in the<br>GEM and MAGNET. In one that I came across an actual MAJORITY of the boys<br>mentioned were titled.<br><br>Where working-class characters appear, it is usually either as comics<br>(jokes about tramps, convicts, etc.), or as prize-fighters, acrobats,<br>cowboys, professional footballers and Foreign Legionaries--in other<br>words, as adventurers. There is no facing of the facts about<br>working-class life, or, indeed, about WORKING life of any description.<br>Very occasionally one may come across a realistic description of, say,<br>work in a coal-mine, but in all probability it will only be there as the<br>background of some lurid adventure. In any case the central character is<br>not likely to be a coal-miner. Nearly all the time the boy who reads<br>these papers--in nine cases out often a boy who is going to spend his<br>life working in a shop, in a factory or in some subordinate job in an<br>office--is led to identify with people in positions of command, above<br>all with people who are never troubled by shortage of money. The Lord<br>Peter Wimsey figure, the seeming idiot who drawls and wears a monocle but<br>is always to the fore in moments of danger, turns up over and over again.<br>(This character is a great favourite in Secret Service stories.) And, as<br>usual, the heroic characters all have to talk B.B.C.; they may talk<br>Scottish or Irish or American, but no one in a star part is ever<br>permitted to drop an aitch. Here it is worth comparing the social<br>atmosphere of the boys' weeklies with that of the women's weeklies, the<br>ORACLE, the FAMILY STAR, PEG'S PAPER, etc.<br><br>The women's papers are aimed at an older public and are read for the most<br>part by girls who are working for a living. Consequently they are on the<br>surface much more realistic. It is taken for granted, for example, that<br>nearly everyone has to live in a big town and work at a more or less dull<br>job. Sex, so far from being taboo, is THE subject. The short, complete<br>stories, the special feature of these papers, are generally of the 'came<br>the dawn' type: the heroine narrowly escapes losing her 'boy' to a<br>designing rival, or the 'boy' loses his job and has to postpone marriage,<br>but presently gets a better job. The changeling-fantasy (a girl brought<br>up in a poor home is 'really' the child of rich parents) is another<br>favourite. Where sensationalism comes in, usually in the serials, it<br>arises out of the more domestic type of crime, such as bigamy, forgery or<br>sometimes murder; no Martians, death-rays or international anarchist<br>gangs. These papers are at any rate aiming at credibility, and they have<br>a link with real life in their correspondence columns, where genuine<br>problems are being discussed. Ruby M. Ayres's column of advice in the<br>ORACLE, for instance, is extremely sensible and well written. And yet the<br>world of the ORACLE and PEG'S PAPER is a pure fantasy-world. It is the<br>same fantasy all the time; pretending to be richer than you are. The<br>chief impression that one carries away from almost every story in these<br>papers is of a frightful, overwhelming 'refinement'. Ostensibly the<br>characters are working-class people, but their habits, the interiors of<br>their houses, their clothes, their outlook and, above all, their speech<br>arc entirely middle class. They are all living at several pounds a week<br>above their income. And needless to say, that is just the impression that<br>is intended. The idea is to give the bored factory-girl or worn-out<br>mother of five a dream-life in which she pictures herself--not actually<br>as a duchess (that convention has gone out) but as, say, the wife of a<br>bank-manager. Not only is a five-to-six-pound-a-week standard of life set<br>up as the ideal, but it is tacitly assumed that that is how working-class<br>people really DO live. The major facts arc simply not faced. It is<br>admitted, for instance, that people sometimes lose their jobs; but then<br>the dark clouds roll away and they get better jobs instead. No mention of<br>un-employment as something permanent and inevitable, no mention of the<br>dole, no mention of trade unionism. No suggestion anywhere that there can<br>be anything wrong with the system AS A SYSTEM; there arc only individual<br>misfortunes, which are generally due to somebody's wickedness and can in<br>any case be put right in the last chapter. Always the dark clouds roll<br>away, the kind employer raises Alfred's wages, and there are jobs for<br>everybody except the drunks. It is still the world of the WIZARD and the<br>GEM, except that there are orange-blossoms instead of machine-guns.<br><br>The outlook inculcated by all these papers is that of a rather<br>exceptionally stupid member of the Navy League in the year 1910. Yes, it<br>may be said, but what does it matter? And in any case, what else do you<br>expect?<br><br>Of course no one in his senses would want to turn the so-called penny<br>dreadful into a realistic novel or a Socialist tract. An adventure story<br>must of its nature be more or less remote from real life. But, as I have<br>tried to make clear, the unreality of the WIZARD and the GEM is not so<br>artless as it looks. These papers exist because of a specialized demand,<br>because boys at certain ages find it necessary to read about Martians,<br>death-rays, grizzly bears and gangsters. They get what they are looking<br>for, but they get it wrapped up in the illusions which their future<br>employers think suitable for them. To what extent people draw their ideas<br>from fiction is disputable. Personally I believe that most people are<br>influenced far more than they would care to admit by novels, serial<br>stories, films and so forth, and that from this point of view the worst<br>books are often the most important, because they are usually the ones<br>that are read earliest in life. It is probable that many people who would<br>consider themselves extremely sophisticated and 'advanced' are actually<br>carrying through life an imaginative background which they acquired in<br>childhood from (for instance) Sapper and lan Hay. If that is so, the<br>boys' twopenny weeklies are of the deepest importance. Here is the stuff<br>that is read somewhere between the ages of twelve and eighteen by a very<br>large proportion, perhaps an actual majority, of English boys, including<br>many who will never read anything else except newspapers; and along with<br>it they are absorbing a set of beliefs which would be regarded as<br>hopelessly out of date in the Central Office of the Conservative Party.<br>All the better because it is done indirectly, there is being pumped into<br>them the conviction that the major problems of our time do not exist,<br>that there is nothing wrong with LAISSEZ-FAIRE capitalism, that<br>foreigners are un-important comics and that the British Empire is a sort<br>of charity-concern which will last for ever. Considering who owns these<br>papers, it is difficult to believe that this is un-intentional. Of the<br>twelve papers I have been discussing (i.e. twelve including the THRILLER<br>and DETECTIVE WEEKLY) seven are the property of the Amalgamated Press,<br>which is one of the biggest press-combines in the world and controls more<br>than a hundred different papers. The GEM and MAGNET, therefore, are<br>closely linked up with the DAILY TELEGRAPH and the FINANCIAL TIMES. This<br>in itself would be enough to rouse certain suspicions, even if it were<br>not obvious that the stories in the boys' weeklies are politically<br>vetted. So it appears that if you feel the need of a fantasy-life in<br>which you travel to Mars and fight lions bare-handed (and what boy<br>doesn't?), you can only have it by delivering yourself over, mentally, to<br>people like Lord Camrose. For there is no competition. Throughout the<br>whole of this run of papers the differences are negligible, and on this<br>level no others exist. This raises the question, why is there no such<br>thing as a left-wing boys' paper?<br><br>At first glance such an idea merely makes one slightly sick. It is so<br>horribly easy to imagine what a left-wing boys' paper would be like, if<br>it existed. I remember in 1920 or 1921 some optimistic person handing<br>round Communist tracts among a crowd of public-school boys. The tract I<br>received was of the question-and-answer kind:<br><br>Q,. 'Can a Boy Communist be a Boy Scout, Comrade?'<br>A. 'No, Comrade.'<br>Q,. 'Why, Comrade?'<br>A. 'Because, Comrade, a Boy Scout must salute the Union Jack, which is<br>the symbol of tyranny and oppression,' etc., etc.<br><br>Now suppose that at this moment somebody started a left-wing paper<br>deliberately aimed at boys of twelve or fourteen. I do not suggest that<br>the whole of its contents would be exactly like the tract I have quoted<br>above, but does anyone doubt that they would be SOMETHING like it?<br>Inevitably such a paper would either consist of dreary up-lift or it<br>would be under Communist influence and given over to adulation of Soviet<br>Russia; in either case no normal boy would ever look at it. Highbrow<br>literature apart, the whole of the existing left-wing Press, in so far as<br>it is at all vigorously 'left', is one long tract. The one Socialist<br>paper in England which could live a week on its merits AS A PAPER is the<br>DAILY HERALD: and how much Socialism is there in the DAILY HERALD? At<br>this moment, therefore, a paper with a 'left' slant and at the same time<br>likely to have an appeal to ordinary boys in their teens is something<br>almost beyond hoping for.<br><br>But it does not follow that it is impossible. There is no clear reason<br>why every adventure story should necessarily be mixed up with<br>snobbishness and gutter patriotism. For, after all, the stories in the<br>HOTSPUR and the MODERN BOY are not Conservative tracts; they are merely<br>adventure stories with a Conservative bias. It is fairly easy to imagine<br>the process being reversed. It is possible, for instance, to imagine a<br>paper as thrilling and lively as the HOTSPUR, but with subject-matter and<br>'ideology' a little more up to date. It is even possible (though this<br>raises other difficulties) to imagine a women's paper at the same<br>literary level as the ORACLE, dealing in approximately the same kind of<br>story, but taking rather more account of the realities of working-class<br>life. Such things have been done before, though not in England. In the<br>last years of the Spanish monarchy there was a large output in Spain of<br>left-wing novelettes, some of them evidently of anarchist origin.<br>Unfortunately at the time when they were appearing I did not see their<br>social significance, and I lost the collection of them that I had, but no<br>doubt copies would still be procurable. In get-up and style of story they<br>were very similar to the English fourpcnny novelette, except that their<br>inspiration was 'left'. If, for instance, a story described police<br>pursuing anarchists through the mountains, it would be from the point of<br>view of the anarchist and not of the police. An example nearer to hand is<br>the Soviet film CHAPAIEV, which has been shown a number of times in<br>London. Technically, by the standards of the time when it was made,<br>CHAPAIEV is a first-rate film, but mentally, in spite of the unfamiliar<br>Russian background, it is not so very remote from Hollywood. The one<br>thing that lifts it out of the ordinary is the remarkable performance by<br>the actor who takes the part of the White officer (the fat one)--a<br>performance which looks very like an inspired piece of gagging. Otherwise<br>the atmosphere is familiar. All the usual paraphernalia is there--heroic<br>fight against odds, escape at the last moment, shots of galloping horses,<br>love interest, comic relief. The film is in fact a fairly ordinary one,<br>except that its tendency is 'left'. In a Hollywood film of the Russian<br>Civil War the Whites would probably be angels and the Reds demons. In the<br>Russian version the Reds are angels and the Whites demons. That is also a<br>lie, but, taking the long view, it is a less pernicious lie than the<br>other.<br><br>Here several difficult problems present themselves. Their general nature<br>is obvious enough, and I do not want to discuss them. I am merely<br>pointing to the fact that, in England, popular imaginative literature is<br>a field that left-wing thought has never begun to enter. ALL fiction from<br>the novels in the mushroom libraries downwards is censored in the<br>interests of the ruling class. And boys' fiction above all, the<br>blood-and-thunder stuff which nearly every boy devours at some time or<br>other, is sodden in the worst illusions of 1910. The fact is only<br>unimportant if one believes that what is read in childhood leaves no<br>impression behind. Lord Camrose and his colleagues evidently believe<br>nothing of the kind, and, after all, Lord Camrose ought to know.<br><br></font></p>
