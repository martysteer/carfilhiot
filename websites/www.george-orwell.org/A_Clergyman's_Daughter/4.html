<h2>Chapter 5</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">1<br><br><br>However, it turned out quite otherwise. For Dorothy had not gone<br>five yards from the gate when a telegraph boy came riding up the<br>street in the opposite direction, whistling and looking at the<br>names of the houses. He saw the name Ringwood House, wheeled his<br>bicycle round, propped it against the kerb, and accosted Dorothy.<br><br>'Miss Mill-BURROW live 'ere?' he said, jerking his head in the<br>direction of Ringwood House.<br><br>'Yes. I am Miss Millborough.'<br><br>'Gotter wait case there's a answer,' said the boy, taking an<br>orange-coloured envelope from his belt.<br><br>Dorothy put down her bag. She had once more begun trembling<br>violently. And whether this was from joy or fear she was not<br>certain, for two conflicting thoughts had sprung almost<br>simultaneously into her brain. One, 'This is some kind of good<br>news!' The other, 'Father is seriously ill!' She managed to tear<br>the envelope open, and found a telegram which occupied two pages,<br>and which she had the greatest difficulty in understanding. It<br>ran:<br><br><br>Rejoice in the lord o ye righteous note of exclamation great news<br>note of exclamation your reputation absolutely reestablished stop<br>mrs semprill fallen into the pit that she hath digged stop action<br>for libel stop no one believes her any longer stop your father<br>wishes you return home immediately stop am coming up to town myself<br>comma will pick you up if you like stop arriving shortly after this<br>stop wait for me stop praise him with the loud cymbals note of<br>exclamation much love stop.<br><br><br>No need to look at the signature. It was from Mr Warburton, of<br>course. Dorothy felt weaker and more tremulous than ever. She was<br>dimly aware the telegraph boy was asking her something.<br><br>'Any answer?' he said for the third or fourth time.<br><br>'Not today, thank you,' said Dorothy vaguely.<br><br>The boy remounted his bicycle and rode off, whistling with extra<br>loudness to show Dorothy how much he despised her for not tipping<br>him. But Dorothy was unaware of the telegraph's boy's scorn. The<br>only phrase of the telegram that she had fully understood was 'your<br>father wishes you return home immediately', and the surprise of it<br>had left her in a semi-dazed condition. For some indefinite time<br>she stood on the pavement, until presently a taxi rolled up the<br>street, with Mr Warburton inside it. He saw Dorothy, stopped the<br>taxi, jumped out and came across to meet her, beaming. He seized<br>her both hands.<br><br>'Hullo!' he cried, and at once threw his arm pseudo-paternally<br>about her and drew her against him, heedless of who might be<br>looking. 'How are you? But by Jove, how thin you've got! I can<br>feel all your ribs. Where is this school of yours?'<br><br>Dorothy, who had not yet managed to get free of his arm, turned<br>partly round and cast a glance towards the dark windows of Ringwood<br>House.<br><br>'What! That place? Good God, what a hole! What have you done<br>with your luggage?'<br><br>'It's inside. I've left them the money to send it on. I think<br>it'll be all right.'<br><br>'Oh, nonsense! Why pay? We'll take it with us. It can go on top<br>of the taxi.'<br><br>'No, no! Let them send it. I daren't go back. Mrs Creevy would<br>be horribly angry.'<br><br>'Mrs Creevy? Who's Mrs Creevy?'<br><br>'The headmistress--at least, she owns the school.'<br><br>'What, a dragon, is she? Leave her to me--I'll deal with her.<br>Perseus and the Gorgon, what? You are Andromeda. Hi!' he called<br>to the taxi-driver.<br><br>The two of them went up to the front door and Mr Warburton knocked.<br>Somehow, Dorothy never believed that they would succeed in getting<br>her box from Mrs Creevy. In fact, she half expected to see them<br>come out flying for their lives, and Mrs Creevy after them with her<br>broom. However, in a couple of minutes they reappeared, the taxi-<br>driver carrying the box on his shoulder. Mr Warburton handed<br>Dorothy into the taxi and, as they sat down, dropped half a crown<br>into her hand.<br><br>'What a woman! What a woman!' he said comprehensively as the taxi<br>bore them away. 'How the devil have you put up with it all this<br>time?'<br><br>'What is this?' said Dorothy, looking at the coin.<br><br>'Your half-crown that you left to pay for the luggage. Rather a<br>feat getting it out of the old girl, wasn't it?'<br><br>'But I left five shillings!' said Dorothy.<br><br>'What! The woman told me you only left half a crown. By God, what<br>impudence! We'll go back and have the half-crown out of her. Just<br>to spite her!' He tapped on the glass.<br><br>'No, no!' said Dorothy, laying her hand on his arm. 'It doesn't<br>matter in the least. Let's get away from here--right away. I<br>couldn't bear to go back to that place again--EVER!'<br><br>It was quite true. She felt that she would sacrifice not merely<br>half a crown, but all the money in her possession, sooner than set<br>eyes on Ringwood House again. So they drove on, leaving Mrs Creevy<br>victorious. It would be interesting to know whether this was<br>another of the occasions when Mrs Creevy laughed.<br><br>Mr Warburton insisted on taking the taxi the whole way into London,<br>and talked so voluminously in the quieter patches of the traffic<br>that Dorothy could hardly get a word in edgeways. It was not till<br>they had reached the inner suburbs that she got from him an<br>explanation of the sudden change in her fortunes.<br><br>'Tell me,' she said, 'what is it that's happened? I don't<br>understand. Why is it all right for me to go home all of a sudden?<br>Why don't people believe Mrs Semprill any longer? Surely she<br>hasn't confessed?'<br><br>'Confessed? Not she! But her sins have found her out, all the<br>same. It was the kind of thing that you pious people would ascribe<br>to the finger of Providence. Cast thy bread upon the waters, and<br>all that. She got herself into a nasty mess--an action for libel.<br>We've talked of nothing else in Knype Hill for the last fortnight.<br>I though you would have seen something about it in the newspapers.'<br><br>'I've hardly looked at a paper for ages. Who brought an action for<br>libel? Not my father, surely?'<br><br>'Good gracious, no! Clergymen can't bring actions for libel. It<br>was the bank manager. Do you remember her favourite story about<br>him--how he was keeping a woman on the bank's money, and so forth?'<br><br>'Yes, I think so.'<br><br>'A few months ago she was foolish enough to put some of it in<br>writing. Some kind friend--some female friend, I presume--took the<br>letter round to the bank manager. He brought an action--Mrs<br>Semprill was ordered to pay a hundred and fifty pounds damages.<br>I don't suppose she paid a halfpenny, but still, that's the end of<br>her career as a scandalmonger. You can go on blackening people's<br>reputations for years, and everyone will believe you, more or less,<br>even when it's perfectly obvious that you're lying. But once<br>you've been proved a liar in open court, you're disqualified, so to<br>speak. Mrs Semprill's done for, so far as Knype Hill goes. She<br>left the town between days--practically did a moonlight flit, in<br>fact. I believe she's inflicting herself on Bury St Edmunds at<br>present.'<br><br>'But what has all that got to do with the things she said about you<br>and me?'<br><br>'Nothing--nothing whatever. But why worry? The point is that<br>you're reinstated; and all the hags who've been smacking their<br>chops over you for months past are saying, "Poor, poor Dorothy, how<br>SHOCKINGLY that dreadful woman has treated her!"'<br><br>'You mean they think that because Mrs Semprill was telling lies in<br>one case she must have been telling lies in another?'<br><br>'No doubt that's what they'd say if they were capable of reasoning<br>it out. At any rate, Mrs Semprill's in disgrace, and so all the<br>people she's slandered must be martyrs. Even MY reputation is<br>practically spotless for the time being.'<br><br>'And do you think that's really the end of it? Do you think they<br>honestly believe that it was all an accident--that I only lost my<br>memory and didn't elope with anybody?'<br><br>'Oh, well, I wouldn't go as far as that. In these country places<br>there's always a certain amount of suspicion knocking about. Not<br>suspicion of anything in particular, you know; just generalized<br>suspicion. A sort of instinctive rustic dirty-mindedness. I can<br>imagine its being vaguely rumoured in the bar parlour of the Dog<br>and Bottle in ten years' time that you've got some nasty secret in<br>your past, only nobody can remember what. Still, your troubles are<br>over. If I were you I wouldn't give any explanations till you're<br>asked for them. The official theory is that you had a bad attack<br>of flu and went away to recuperate. I should stick to that.<br>You'll find they'll accept it all right. Officially, there's<br>nothing against you.<br><br>Presently they got to London, and Mr Warburton took Dorothy to<br>lunch at a restaurant in Coventry Street, where they had a young<br>chicken, roasted, with asparagus and tiny, pearly-white potatoes<br>that had been ripped untimely from their mother earth, and also<br>treacle tart and a nice warm bottle of Burgundy; but what gave<br>Dorothy the most pleasure of all, after Mrs Creevy's lukewarm water<br>tea, was the black coffee they had afterwards. After lunch they<br>took another taxi to Liverpool Street Station and caught the 2.45.<br>It was a four-hour journey to Knype Hill.<br><br>Mr Warburton insisted on travelling first-class, and would not hear<br>of Dorothy paying her own fare; he also, when Dorothy was not<br>looking, tipped the guard to let them have a carriage to themselves.<br>It was one of those bright cold days which are spring or winter<br>according as you are indoors or out. From behind the shut windows<br>of the carriage the too-blue sky looked warm and kind, and all the<br>slummy wilderness through which the train was rattling--the<br>labyrinths of little dingy-coloured houses, the great chaotic<br>factories, the miry canals, and derelict building lots littered with<br>rusty boilers and overgrown by smoke-blackened weeds--all were<br>redeemed and gilded by the sun. Dorothy hardly spoke for the first<br>half-hour of the journey. For the moment she was too happy to talk.<br>She did not even think of anything in particular, but merely sat<br>there luxuriating in the glass-filtered sunlight, in the comfort of<br>the padded seat and the feeling of having escaped from Mrs Creevy's<br>clutches. But she was aware that this mood could not last very much<br>longer. Her contentment, like the warmth of the wine that she had<br>drunk at lunch, was ebbing away, and thoughts either painful or<br>difficult to express were taking shape in her mind. Mr Warburton<br>had been watching her face, more observantly than was usual for him,<br>as though trying to gauge the changes that the past eight months had<br>worked in her.<br><br>'You look older,' he said finally.<br><br>'I am older,' said Dorothy.<br><br>'Yes; but you look--well, more completely grown up. Tougher.<br>Something has changed in your face. You look--if you'll forgive<br>the expression--as though the Girl Guide had been exorcized from<br>you for good and all. I hope seven devils haven't entered into you<br>instead?' Dorothy did not answer, and he added: 'I suppose, as a<br>matter of fact, you must have had the very devil of a time?'<br><br>'Oh, beastly! Sometimes too beastly for words. Do you know that<br>sometimes--'<br><br>She paused. She had been about to tell him how she had had to beg<br>for her food; how she had slept in the streets; how she had been<br>arrested for begging and spent a night in the police cells; how Mrs<br>Creevy had nagged at her and starved her. But she stopped, because<br>she had suddenly realized that these were not the things that she<br>wanted to talk about. Such things as these, she perceived, are of<br>no real importance; they are mere irrelevant accidents, not<br>essentially different from catching a cold in the head or having to<br>wait two hours at a railway junction. They are disagreeable, but<br>they do not matter. The truism that all real happenings are in the<br>mind struck her more forcibly than ever before, and she said:<br><br>'Those things don't really matter. I mean, things like having no<br>money and not having enough to eat. Even when you're practically<br>starving--it doesn't CHANGE anything inside you.'<br><br>'Doesn't it? I'll take your word for it. I should be very sorry<br>to try.'<br><br>'Oh, well, it's beastly while it's happening, of course; but it<br>doesn't make any real difference; it's the things that happen<br>inside you that matter.'<br><br>'Meaning?' said Mr Warburton.<br><br>'Oh--things change in your mind. And then the whole world changes,<br>because you look at it differently.'<br><br>She was still looking out of the window. The train had drawn clear<br>of the eastern slums and was running at gathering speed past<br>willow-bordered streams and low-lying meadows upon whose hedges the<br>first buds made a faint soft greenness, like a cloud. In a field<br>near the line a month-old calf, flat as a Noah's Ark animal, was<br>bounding stiff-legged after its mother, and in a cottage garden an<br>old labourer, with slow, rheumatic movements, was turning over the<br>soil beneath a pear tree covered with ghostly bloom. His spade<br>flashed in the sun as the train passed. The depressing hymn-line<br>'Change and decay in all around I see' moved through Dorothy's<br>mind. It was true what she had said just now. Something had<br>happened in her heart, and the world was a little emptier, a little<br>poorer from that minute. On such a day as this, last spring or any<br>earlier spring, how joyfully, and how unthinkingly, she would have<br>thanked God for the first blue skies and the first flowers of the<br>reviving year! And now, seemingly, there was no God to thank, and<br>nothing--not a flower or a stone or a blade of grass--nothing in<br>the universe would ever be the same again.<br><br>'Things change in your mind,' she repeated. 'I've lost my faith,'<br>she added, somewhat abruptly, because she found herself half<br>ashamed to utter the words.<br><br>'You've lost your WHAT?' said Mr Warburton, less accustomed than<br>she to this kind of phraseology.<br><br>'My faith. Oh, you know what I mean! A few months ago, all of a<br>sudden, it seemed as if my whole mind had changed. Everything that<br>I'd believed in till then--everything--seemed suddenly meaningless<br>and almost silly. God--what I'd meant by God--immortal life,<br>Heaven and Hell--everything. It had all gone. And it wasn't that<br>I'd reasoned it out; it just happened to me. It was like when<br>you're a child, and one day, for no particular reason, you stop<br>believing in fairies. I just couldn't go on believing in it any<br>longer.'<br><br>'You never did believe in it,' said Mr Warburton unconcernedly.<br><br>'But I did, really I did! I know you always thought I didn't--you<br>thought I was just pretending because I was ashamed to own up. But<br>it wasn't that at all. I believed it just as I believe that I'm<br>sitting in this carriage.'<br><br>'Of course you didn't, my poor child! How could you, at your age?<br>You were far too intelligent for that. But you'd been brought up<br>in these absurd beliefs, and you'd allowed yourself to go on<br>thinking, in a sort of way, that you could still swallow them.<br>You'd built yourself a life-pattern--if you'll excuse a bit of<br>psychological jargon--that was only possible for a believer, and<br>naturally it was beginning to be a strain on you. In fact, it was<br>obvious all the time what was the matter with you. I should say<br>that in all probability that was why you lost your memory.'<br><br>'What do you mean?' she said, rather puzzled by this remark.<br><br>He saw that she did not understand, and explained to her that loss<br>of memory is only a device, unconsciously used, to escape from an<br>impossible situation. The mind, he said, will play curious tricks<br>when it is in a tight corner. Dorothy had never heard of anything<br>of this kind before, and she could not at first accept his<br>explanation. Nevertheless she considered it for a moment, and<br>perceived that, even if it were true, it did not alter the<br>fundamental fact.<br><br>'I don't see that it makes any difference,' she said finally.<br><br>'Doesn't it? I should have said it made a considerable<br>difference.'<br><br>'But don't you see, if my faith is gone, what does it matter<br>whether I've only lost it now or whether I'd really lost it years<br>ago? All that matters is that it's gone, and I've got to begin my<br>life all over again.'<br><br>'Surely I don't take you to mean,' said Mr Warburton, 'that you<br>actually REGRET losing your faith, as you call it? One might as<br>well regret losing a goitre. Mind you, I'm speaking, as it were,<br>without the book--as a man who never had very much faith to lose.<br>The little I had passed away quite painlessly at the age of nine.<br>But it's hardly the kind of thing I should have thought anyone<br>would REGRET losing. Used you not, if I remember rightly, to do<br>horrible things like getting up at five in the morning to go to<br>Holy Communion on an empty belly? Surely you're not homesick for<br>that kind of thing?'<br><br>'I don't believe in it any longer, if that's what you mean. And I<br>see now that a lot of it was rather silly. But that doesn't help.<br>The point is that all the beliefs I had are gone, and I've nothing<br>to put in their place.'<br><br>'But good God! why do you want to put anything in their place?<br>You've got rid of a load of superstitious rubbish, and you ought to<br>be glad of it. Surely it doesn't make you any happier to go about<br>quaking in fear of Hell fire?'<br><br>'But don't you see--you must see--how different everything is when<br>all of a sudden the whole world is empty?'<br><br>'Empty?' exclaimed Mr Warburton. 'What do you mean by saying it's<br>empty? I call that perfectly scandalous in a girl of your age.<br>It's not empty at all, it's a deuced sight too full, that's the<br>trouble with it. We're here today and gone tomorrow, and we've no<br>time to enjoy what we've got.'<br><br>'But how CAN one enjoy anything when all the meaning's been taken<br>out of it?'<br><br>'Good gracious! What do you want with a meaning? When I eat my<br>dinner I don't do it to the greater glory of God; I do it because I<br>enjoy it. The world's full of amusing things--books, pictures,<br>wine, travel, friends--everything. I've never seen any meaning in<br>it all, and I don't want to see one. Why not take life as you find<br>it?'<br><br>'But--'<br><br>She broke off, for she saw already that she was wasting words in<br>trying to make herself clear to him. He was quite incapable of<br>understanding her difficulty--incapable of realizing how a mind<br>naturally pious must recoil from a world discovered to be<br>meaningless. Even the loathsome platitudes of the pantheists would<br>be beyond his understanding. Probably the idea that life was<br>essentially futile, if he thought of it at all, struck him as<br>rather amusing than otherwise. And yet with all this he was<br>sufficiently acute. He could see the difficulty of her own<br>particular position, and he adverted to it a moment later.<br><br>'Of course,' he said, 'I can see that things are going to be a<br>little awkward for you when you get home. You're going to be, so<br>to speak, a wolf in sheep's clothing. Parish work--Mothers'<br>Meetings, prayers with the dying, and all that--I suppose it might<br>be a little distasteful at times. Are you afraid you won't be able<br>to keep it up--is that the trouble?'<br><br>'Oh, no. I wasn't thinking of that. I shall go on with it, just<br>the same as before. It's what I'm most used to. Besides, Father<br>needs my help. He can't afford a curate, and the work's got to be<br>done.'<br><br>'Then what's the matter? Is it the hypocrisy that's worrying you?<br>Afraid that the consecrated bread might stick in your throat, and<br>so forth? I shouldn't trouble. Half the parsons' daughters in<br>England are probably in the same difficulty. And quite nine-tenths<br>of the parsons, I should say.'<br><br>'It's partly that. I shall have to be always pretending--oh, you<br>can't imagine in what ways! But that's not the worst. Perhaps<br>that part of it doesn't matter, really. Perhaps it's better to be<br>a hypocrite--THAT kind of hypocrite--than some things.'<br><br>'Why do you say THAT kind of hypocrite? I hope you don't mean that<br>pretending to believe is the next best thing to believing?'<br><br>'Yes . . . I suppose that's what I do mean. Perhaps it's better--<br>less selfish--to pretend one believes even when one doesn't, than<br>to say openly that one's an unbeliever and perhaps help turn other<br>people into unbelievers too.'<br><br>'My dear Dorothy,' said Mr Warburton, 'your mind, if you'll excuse<br>my saying so, is in a morbid condition. No, dash it! it's worse<br>than morbid; it's downright septic. You've a sort of mental<br>gangrene hanging over from your Christian upbringing. You tell me<br>that you've got rid of these ridiculous beliefs that were stuffed<br>into you from your cradle upwards, and yet you're taking an<br>attitude to life which is simply meaningless without those beliefs.<br>Do you call that reasonable?'<br><br>'I don't know. No perhaps it's not. But I suppose it's what comes<br>naturally to me.'<br><br>'What you're trying to do, apparently,' pursued Mr Warburton, 'is<br>to make the worst of both worlds. You stick to the Christian<br>scheme of things, but you leave Paradise out of it. And I suppose,<br>if the truth were known, there are quite a lot of your kind<br>wandering about among the ruins of C. of E. You're practically a<br>sect in yourselves,' he added reflectively: 'the Anglican Atheists.<br>Not a sect I should care to belong to, I must say.'<br><br>They talked for a little while longer, but not to much purpose. In<br>reality the whole subject of religious belief and religious doubt<br>was boring and incomprehensible to Mr Warburton. Its only appeal<br>to him was as a pretext for blasphemy. Presently he changed the<br>subject, as though giving up the attempt to understand Dorothy's<br>outlook.<br><br>'This is nonsense that we're talking,' he said. 'You've got hold<br>of some very depressing ideas, but you'll grow out of them later<br>on, you know. Christianity isn't really an incurable disease.<br>However, there was something quite different that I was going to<br>say to you. I want you to listen to me for a moment. You're<br>coming home, after being away eight months, to what I expect you<br>realize is a rather uncomfortable situation. You had a hard enough<br>life before--at least, what I should call a hard life--and now that<br>you aren't quite such a good Girl Guide as you used to be, it's<br>going to be a great deal harder. Now, do you think it's absolutely<br>necessary to go back to it?'<br><br>'But I don't see what else I can do, unless I could get another<br>job. I've really no alternative.'<br><br>Mr Warburton, with his head cocked a little on one side, gave<br>Dorothy a rather curious look.<br><br>'As a matter of fact,' he said, in a more serious tone than usual,<br>'there's at least one other alternative that I could suggest to<br>you.'<br><br>'You mean that I could go on being a schoolmistress? Perhaps<br>that's what I ought to do, really. I shall come back to it in the<br>end, in any case.'<br><br>'No. I don't think that's what I should advise.'<br><br>All this time Mr Warburton, unwilling as ever to expose his<br>baldness, had been wearing his rakish, rather broad-brimmed grey<br>felt hat. Now, however, he took it off and laid it carefully on<br>the empty seat beside him. His naked cranium, with only a wisp or<br>two of golden hair lingering in the neighbourhood of the ears,<br>looked like some monstrous pink pearl. Dorothy watched him with a<br>slight surprise.<br><br>'I am taking my hat off,' he said, 'in order to let you see me at<br>my very worst. You will understand why in a moment. Now, let me<br>offer you another alternative besides going back to your Girl<br>Guides and your Mothers' Union, or imprisoning yourself in some<br>dungeon of a girls' school.'<br><br>'What do you mean?' said Dorothy.<br><br>'I mean, will you--think well before you answer; I admit there are<br>some very obvious objections, but--will you marry me?'<br><br>Dorothy's lips parted with surprise. Perhaps she turned a little<br>paler. With a hasty, almost unconscious recoil she moved as far<br>away from him as the back of the seat would allow. But he had made<br>no movement towards her. He said with complete equanimity:<br><br>'You know, of course, that Dolores [Dolores was Mr Warburton's ex-<br>mistress] left me a year ago?'<br><br>'But I can't, I can't!' exclaimed Dorothy. 'You know I can't! I'm<br>not--like that. I thought you always knew. I shan't ever marry.'<br><br>Mr Warburton ignored this remark.<br><br>'I grant you,' he said, still with exemplary calmness, 'that I<br>don't exactly come under the heading of eligible young men. I am<br>somewhat older than you. We both seem to be putting our cards on<br>the table today, so I'll let you into a great secret and tell you<br>that my age is forty-nine. And then I've three children and a bad<br>reputation. It's a marriage that your father would--well, regard<br>with disfavour. And my income is only seven hundred a year. But<br>still, don't you think it's worth considering!'<br><br>'I can't, you know why I can't!' repeated Dorothy.<br><br>She took it for granted that he 'knew why she couldn't', though she<br>had never explained to him, or to anyone else, why it was impossible<br>for her to marry. Very probably, even if she had explained, he<br>would not have understood her. He went on speaking, not appearing<br>to notice what she had said.<br><br>'Let me put it to you', he said, 'in the form of a bargain. Of<br>course, I needn't tell you that it's a great deal more than that.<br>I'm not a marrying kind of man, as the saying goes, and I shouldn't<br>ask you to marry me if you hadn't a rather special attraction for<br>me. But let me put the business side of it first. You need a home<br>and a livelihood; I need a wife to keep me in order. I'm sick of<br>these disgusting women I've spent my life with, if you'll forgive<br>my mentioning them, and I'm rather anxious to settle down. A bit<br>late in the day, perhaps, but better late than never. Besides, I<br>need somebody to look after the children; the BASTARDS, you know.<br>I don't expect you to find me overwhelmingly attractive,' he added,<br>running a hand reflectively over his bald crown, 'but on the other<br>hand I am very easy to get on with. Immoral people usually are, as<br>a matter of fact. And from your own point of view the scheme would<br>have certain advantages. Why should you spend your life delivering<br>parish magazines and rubbing nasty old women's legs with Elliman's<br>embrocation? You would be happier married, even to a husband with<br>a bald head and a clouded past. You've had a hard, dull life for a<br>girl of your age, and your future isn't exactly rosy. Have you<br>really considered what your future will be like if you don't<br>marry?'<br><br>'I don't know. I have to some extent,' she said.<br><br>As he had not attempted to lay hands on her or to offer any<br>endearments, she answered his question without repeating her<br>previous refusal. He looked out of the window, and went on in a<br>musing voice, much quieter than his normal tone, so that at first<br>she could barely hear him above the rattle of the train; but<br>presently his voice rose, and took on a note of seriousness that<br>she had never heard in it before, or even imagined that it could<br>hold.<br><br>'Consider what your future would be like,' he repeated. 'It's the<br>same future that lies before any woman of your class with no<br>husband and no money. Let us say your father will live another ten<br>years. By the end of that time the last penny of his money will<br>have gone down the sink. The desire to squander it will keep him<br>alive just as long as it lasts, and probably no longer. All that<br>time he will be growing more senile, more tiresome, more impossible<br>to live with; he will tyrannize over you more and more, keep you<br>shorter and shorter of money, make more and more trouble for you<br>with the neighbours and the tradesmen. And you will go on with<br>that slavish, worrying life that you have lived, struggling to make<br>both ends meet, drilling the Girl Guides, reading novels to the<br>Mothers' Union, polishing the altar brasses, cadging money for the<br>organ fund, making brown paper jackboots for the schoolchildren's<br>plays, keeping your end up in the vile little feuds and scandals of<br>the church hen-coop. Year after year, winter and summer, you will<br>bicycle from one reeking cottage to another, to dole out pennies<br>from the poor box and repeat prayers that you don't even believe in<br>any longer. You will sit through interminable church services<br>which in the end will make you physically sick with their sameness<br>and futility. Every year your life will be a little bleaker, a<br>little fuller of those deadly little jobs that are shoved off on to<br>lonely women. And remember that you won't always be twenty-eight.<br>All the while you will be fading, withering, until one morning you<br>will look in the glass and realize that you aren't a girl any<br>longer, only a skinny old maid. You'll fight against it, of<br>course. You'll keep your physical energy and your girlish<br>mannerisms--you'll keep them just a little bit too long. Do you<br>know that type of bright--too bright--spinster who says "topping"<br>and "ripping" and "right-ho", and prides herself on being such a<br>good sport, and she's such a good sport that she makes everyone<br>feel a little unwell? And she's so splendidly hearty at tennis and<br>so handy at amateur theatricals, and she throws herself with a kind<br>of desperation into her Girl Guide work and her parish visiting,<br>and she's the life and soul of Church socials, and always, year<br>after year, she thinks of herself as a young girl still and never<br>realizes that behind her back everyone laughs at her for a poor,<br>disappointed old maid? That's what you'll become, what you must<br>become, however much you foresee it and try to avoid it. There's<br>no other future possible to you unless you marry. Women who don't<br>marry wither up--they wither up like aspidistras in back-parlour<br>windows; and the devilish thing is that they don't even know that<br>they're withering.'<br><br>Dorothy sat silent and listening with intent and horrified<br>fascination. She did not even notice that he had stood up, with<br>one hand on the door to steady him against the swaying of the<br>train. She was as though hypnotized, not so much by his voice as<br>by the visions that his words had evoked in her. He had described<br>her life, as it must inevitably be, with such dreadful fidelity<br>that he seemed actually to have carried her ten years onward into<br>the menacing future, and she felt herself no longer a girl full of<br>youth and energy, but a desperate, worn virgin of thirty-eight. As<br>he went on he took her hand, which was lying idle on the arm of the<br>seat; and even that she scarcely noticed.<br><br>'After ten years,' he continued, 'your father will die, and he will<br>leave you with not a penny, only debts. You will be nearly forty,<br>with no money, no profession, no chance of marrying; just a<br>derelict parson's daughter like the ten thousand others in England.<br>And after that, what do you suppose will become of you? You will<br>have to find yourself a job--the sort of job that parsons'<br>daughters get. A nursery governess, for instance, or companion to<br>some diseased hag who will occupy herself in thinking of ways to<br>humiliate you. Or you will go back to school-teaching; English<br>mistress in some grisly girls' school, seventy-five pounds a year<br>and your keep, and a fortnight in a seaside boarding-house every<br>August. And all the time withering, drying up, growing more sour<br>and more angular and more friendless. And therefore--'<br><br>As he said 'therefore' he pulled Dorothy to her feet. She made no<br>resistance. His voice had put her under a spell. As her mind took<br>in the prospect of that forbidding future, whose emptiness she was<br>far more able to appreciate than he, such a despair had grown in<br>her that if she had spoken at all it would have been to say, 'Yes,<br>I will marry you.' He put his arm very gently about her and drew<br>her a little towards him, and even now she did not attempt to<br>resist. Her eyes, half hypnotized, were fixed upon his. When he<br>put his arm about her it was as though he were protecting her,<br>sheltering her, drawing her away from the brink of grey, deadly<br>poverty and back to the world of friendly and desirable things--to<br>security and ease, to comely houses and good clothes, to books and<br>friends and flowers, to summer days and distant lands. So for<br>nearly a minute the fat, debauched bachelor and the thin,<br>spinsterish girl stood face to face, their eyes meeting, their<br>bodies all but touching, while the train swayed them in its motion,<br>and clouds and telegraph poles and bud-misted hedges and fields<br>green with young wheat raced past unseen.<br><br>Mr Warburton tightened his grip and pulled her against him. It<br>broke the spell. The visions that had held her helpless--visions<br>of poverty and of escape from poverty--suddenly vanished and left<br>only a shocked realization of what was happening to her. She was<br>in the arms of a man--a fattish, oldish man! A wave of disgust and<br>deadly fear went through her, and her entrails seemed to shrink and<br>freeze. His thick male body was pressing her backwards and<br>downwards, his large, pink face, smooth, but to her eyes old, was<br>bearing down upon her own. The harsh odour of maleness forced<br>itself into her nostrils. She recoiled. Furry thighs of satyrs!<br>She began to struggle furiously, though indeed he made hardly any<br>effort to retain her, and in a moment she had wrenched herself free<br>and fallen back into her seat, white and trembling. She looked up<br>at him with eyes which, from fear and aversion, were for a moment<br>those of a stranger.<br><br>Mr Warburton remained on his feet, regarding her with an expression<br>of resigned, almost amused disappointment. He did not seem in the<br>least distressed. As her calmness returned to her she perceived<br>that all he had said had been no more than a trick to play upon her<br>feelings and cajole her into saying that she would marry him; and<br>what was stranger yet, that he had said it without seriously caring<br>whether she married him or not. He had, in fact, merely been<br>amusing himself. Very probably the whole thing was only another of<br>his periodical attempts to seduce her.<br><br>He sat down, but more deliberately than she, taking care of the<br>creases of his trousers as he did so.<br><br>'If you want to pull the communication cord,' he said mildly, 'you<br>had better let me make sure that I have five pounds in my pocket-<br>book.'<br><br>After that he was quite himself again, or as nearly himself as<br>anyone could possibly be after such a scene, and he went on talking<br>without the smallest symptom of embarrassment. His sense of shame,<br>if he had ever possessed one, had perished many years ago. Perhaps<br>it had been killed by overwork in a lifetime of squalid affairs<br>with women.<br><br>For an hour, perhaps, Dorothy was ill at ease, but after that the<br>train reached Ipswich, where it stopped for a quarter of an hour,<br>and there was the diversion of going to the refreshment room for a<br>cup of tea. For the last twenty miles of the journey they talked<br>quite amicably. Mr Warburton did not refer again to his proposal<br>of marriage, but as the train neared Knype Hill he returned, less<br>seriously than before, to the question of Dorothy's future.<br><br>'So you really propose', he said 'to go back to your parish work?<br>"The trivial round, the common task?" Mrs Pither's rheumatism and<br>Mrs Lewin's corn-plaster and all the rest of it? The prospect<br>doesn't dismay you?'<br><br>'I don't know--sometimes it does. But I expect it'll be all right<br>once I'm back at work. I've got the habit, you see.'<br><br>'And you really feel equal to years of calculated hypocrisy? For<br>that's what it amounts to, you know. Not afraid of the cat getting<br>out of the bag? Quite sure you won't find yourself teaching the<br>Sunday School kids to say the Lord's Prayer backwards, or reading<br>Gibbon's fifteenth chapter to the Mothers' Union instead of Gene<br>Stratton Porter?'<br><br>'I don't think so. Because, you see, I do feel that that kind of<br>work, even if it means saying prayers that one doesn't believe in,<br>and even if it means teaching children things that one doesn't<br>always think are true--I do feel that in a way it's useful.'<br><br>'Useful?' said Mr Warburton distastefully. 'You're a little too<br>fond of that depressing word "useful". Hypertrophy of the sense of<br>duty--that's what's the matter with you. Now, to me, it seems the<br>merest common sense to have a bit of fun while the going's good.'<br><br>'That's just hedonism,' Dorothy objected.<br><br>'My dear child, can you show me a philosophy of life that isn't<br>hedonism? Your verminous Christian saints are the biggest hedonists<br>of all. They're out for an eternity of bliss, whereas we poor<br>sinners don't hope for more than a few years of it. Ultimately<br>we're all trying for a bit of fun; but some people take it in such<br>perverted forms. Your notion of fun seems to be massaging Mrs<br>Pither's legs.'<br><br>'It's not that exactly, but--oh! somehow I can't explain!'<br><br>What she would have said was that though her faith had left her,<br>she had not changed, could not change, did not want to change, the<br>spiritual background of her mind; that her cosmos, though now it<br>seemed to her empty and meaningless, was still in a sense the<br>Christian cosmos; that the Christian way of life was still the way<br>that must come naturally to her. But she could not put this into<br>words, and felt that if she tried to do so he would probably begin<br>making fun of her. So she concluded lamely:<br><br>'Somehow I feel that it's better for me to go on as I was before.'<br><br>'EXACTLY the same as before? The whole bill of fare? The Girl<br>Guides, the Mothers' Union, the Band of Hope, the Companionship of<br>Marriage, parish visiting and Sunday School teaching, Holy<br>Communion twice a week and here we go round the doxology-bush,<br>chanting Gregorian plain-song? You're quite certain you can manage<br>it?'<br><br>Dorothy smiled in spite of herself. 'Not plain-song. Father<br>doesn't like it.'<br><br>'And you think that, except for your inner thoughts, your life will<br>be precisely what it was before you lost your faith? There will be<br>NO change in your habits?'<br><br>Dorothy thought. Yes, there WOULD be changes in her habits; but<br>most of them would be secret ones. The memory of the disciplinary<br>pin crossed her mind. It had always been a secret from everyone<br>except herself and she decided not to mention it.<br><br>'Well,' she said finally, 'perhaps at Holy Communion I shall kneel<br>down on Miss Mayfill's right instead of on her left.'<br><br><br><br>2<br><br><br>A week had gone by.<br><br>Dorothy rode up the hill from the town and wheeled her bicycle in<br>at the Rectory gate. It was a fine evening, clear and cold, and<br>the sun, unclouded, was sinking in remote, greenish skies. Dorothy<br>noticed that the ash tree by the gate was in bloom, with clotted<br>dark red blossoms that looked like festerings from a wound.<br><br>She was rather tired. She had had a busy week of it, what with<br>visiting all the women on her list in turn and trying to get the<br>parish affairs into some kind of order again. Everything was in a<br>fearful mess after her absence. The church was dirty beyond all<br>belief--in fact, Dorothy had had to spend the best part of a day<br>cleaning up with scrubbing-brushes, broom and dustpan, and the beds<br>of 'mouse dirts' that she had found behind the organ made her wince<br>when she thought of them. (The reason why the mice came there was<br>because Georgie Frew, the organ-blower, WOULD bring penny packets<br>of biscuits into church and eat them during the sermon.) All the<br>Church associations had been neglected, with the result that the<br>Band of Hope and the Companionship of Marriage had now given up the<br>ghost, Sunday School attendance had dropped by half, and there was<br>internecine warfare going on in the Mothers' Union because of some<br>tactless remark that Miss Foote had made. The belfry was in a<br>worse state than ever. The parish magazine had not been delivered<br>regularly and the money for it had not been collected. None of the<br>accounts of the Church Funds had been properly kept up, and there<br>was nineteen shillings unaccounted for in all, and even the parish<br>registers were in a muddle--and so on and so on, ad infinitum. The<br>Rector had let everything slide.<br><br>Dorothy had been up to her eyes in work from the moment of reaching<br>home. Indeed, things had slipped back into their old routine with<br>astonishing swiftness. It was as though it had been only yesterday<br>that she had gone away. Now that the scandal had blown over, her<br>return to Knype Hill had aroused very little curiosity. Some of<br>the women on her visiting list, particularly Mrs Pither, were<br>genuinely glad to see her back, and Victor Stone, perhaps, seemed<br>just a little ashamed of having temporarily believed Mrs Semprill's<br>libel; but he soon forgot it in recounting to Dorothy his latest<br>triumph in the Church Times. Various of the coffee-ladies, of<br>course, had stopped Dorothy in the street with 'My dear, how VERY<br>nice to see you back again! You HAVE been away a long time! And<br>you know, dear, we all thought it such a SHAME when that horrible<br>woman was going round telling those stories about you. But I do<br>hope you'll understand, dear, that whatever anyone else may have<br>thought, I never believed a word of them', etc., etc., etc. But<br>nobody had asked her the uncomfortable questions that she had been<br>fearing. 'I've been teaching in a school near London' had<br>satisfied everyone; they had not even asked her the name of the<br>school. Never, she saw, would she have to confess that she had<br>slept in Trafalgar Square and been arrested for begging. The fact<br>is that people who live in small country towns have only a very dim<br>conception of anything that happens more than ten miles from their<br>own front door. The world outside is a terra incognita, inhabited,<br>no doubt, by dragons and anthropophagi, but not particularly<br>interesting.<br><br>Even Dorothy's father had greeted her as though she had only been<br>away for the week-end. He was in his study when she arrived,<br>musingly smoking his pipe in front of the grandfather clock, whose<br>glass, smashed by the charwoman's broom-handle four months ago, was<br>still unmended. As Dorothy came into the room he took his pipe out<br>of his mouth and put it away in his pocket with an absent-minded,<br>old-mannish movement. He looked a great deal older, Dorothy<br>thought.<br><br>'So here you are at last,' he said. 'Did you have a good journey?'<br><br>Dorothy put her arms round his neck and touched his silver-pale<br>cheek with her lips. As she disengaged herself he patted her<br>shoulder with a just perceptible trace more affection than usual.<br><br>'What made you take it into your head to run away like that?' he<br>said.<br><br>'I told you, Father--I lost my memory.'<br><br>'Hm,' said the Rector; and Dorothy saw that he did not believe her,<br>never would believe her, and that on many and many a future<br>occasion, when he was in a less agreeable mood than at present,<br>that escapade would be brought up against her. 'Well,' he added,<br>'when you've taken your bag upstairs, just bring your typewriter<br>down here, would you? I want you to type out my sermon.'<br><br>Not much that was of interest had happened in the town. Ye Olde<br>Tea Shoppe was enlarging its premises, to the further disfigurement<br>of the High Street. Mrs Pither's rheumatism was better (thanks to<br>the angelica tea, no doubt), but Mr Pither had 'been under the<br>doctor' and they were afraid he had stone in the bladder. Mr<br>Blifil-Gordon was now in Parliament, a docile deadhead on the back<br>benches of the Conservative Party. Old Mr Tombs had died just<br>after Christmas, and Miss Foote had taken over seven of his cats<br>and made heroic efforts to find homes for the others. Eva Twiss,<br>the niece of Mr Twiss the ironmonger, had had an illegitimate baby,<br>which had died. Proggett had dug the kitchen garden and sowed a<br>few seeds, and the broad beans and the first peas were just<br>showing. The shop-debts had begun to mount up again after the<br>creditors' meeting, and there was six pounds owing to Cargill.<br>Victor Stone had had a controversy with Professor Coulton in the<br>Church Times, about the Holy Inquisition, and utterly routed him.<br>Ellen's eczema had been very bad all the winter. Walph Blifil-<br>Gordon had had two poems accepted by the London Mercury.<br><br>Dorothy went into the conservatory. She had got a big job on hand--<br>costumes for a pageant that the schoolchildren were going to have<br>on St George's Day, in aid of the organ fund. Not a penny had been<br>paid towards the organ during the past eight months, and it was<br>perhaps as well that the Rector always threw the organ-people's<br>bills away unopened, for their tone was growing more and more<br>sulphurous. Dorothy had racked her brains for a way of raising<br>some money, and finally decided on a historical pageant, beginning<br>with Julius Caesar and ending with the Duke of Wellington. They<br>might raise two pounds by a pageant, she thought--with luck and a<br>fine day, they might even raise three pounds!<br><br>She looked round the conservatory. She had hardly been in here<br>since coming home, and evidently nothing had been touched during<br>her absence. Her things were lying just as she had left them; but<br>the dust was thick on everything. Her sewing-machine was on the<br>table amid the old familiar litter of scraps of cloth, sheets of<br>brown paper, cotton-reels and pots of paint, and though the needle<br>had rusted, the thread was still in it. And, yes! there were the<br>jackboots that she had been making the night she went away. She<br>picked one of them up and looked at it. Something stirred in her<br>heart. Yes, say what you like, they WERE good jackboots! What a<br>pity they had never been used! However, they would come in useful<br>for the pageant. For Charles II, perhaps--or, no, better not have<br>Charles II; have Oliver Cromwell instead; because if you had Oliver<br>Cromwell you wouldn't have to make him a wig.<br><br>Dorothy lighted the oilstove, found her scissors and two sheets of<br>brown paper, and sat down. There was a mountain of clothes to be<br>made. Better start off with Julius Caesar's breastplate, she<br>thought. It was always that wretched armour that made all the<br>trouble! What did a Roman soldier's armour look like? Dorothy<br>made an effort, and called to mind the statue of some idealized<br>curly-bearded emperor in the Roman Room at the British Museum. You<br>might make a sort of rough breastplate out of glue and brown paper,<br>and glue narrow strips of paper across it to represent the plates<br>of the armour, and then silver them over. No helmet to make, thank<br>goodness! Julius Caesar always wore a laurel wreath--ashamed of<br>his baldness, no doubt, like Mr Warburton. But what about greaves?<br>Did they wear greaves in Julius Caesar's time? And boots? Was a<br>caligum a boot or a sandal?<br><br>After a few moments she stopped with the shears resting on her<br>knee. A thought which had been haunting her like some inexorcizable<br>ghost at every unoccupied moment during the past week had returned<br>once more to distract her. It was the thought of what Mr Warburton<br>had said to her in the train--of what her life was going to be like<br>hereafter, unmarried and without money.<br><br>It was not that she was in any doubt about the external facts of<br>her future. She could see it all quite clearly before her. Ten<br>years, perhaps, as unsalaried curate, and then back to school-<br>teaching. Not necessarily in quite such a school as Mrs Creevy's--<br>no doubt she could do something rather better for herself than<br>that--but at least in some more or less shabby, more or less<br>prison-like school; or perhaps in some even bleaker, even less<br>human kind of drudgery. Whatever happened, at the very best, she<br>had got to face the destiny that is common to all lonely and<br>penniless women. 'The Old Maids of Old England', as somebody<br>called them. She was twenty-eight--just old enough to enter their<br>ranks.<br><br>But it didn't matter, it didn't matter! That was the thing that<br>you could never drive into the heads of the Mr Warburtons of this<br>world, not if you talked to them for a thousand years; that mere<br>outward things like poverty and drudgery, and even loneliness,<br>don't matter in themselves. It is the things that happen in your<br>heart that matter. For just a moment--an evil moment--while Mr<br>Warburton was talking to her in the train, she had known the fear<br>of poverty. But she had mastered it; it was not a thing worth<br>worrying about. It was not because of THAT that she had got to<br>stiffen her courage and remake the whole structure of her mind.<br><br>No, it was something far more fundamental; it was the deadly<br>emptiness that she had discovered at the heart of things. She<br>thought of how a year ago she had sat in this chair, with these<br>scissors in her hand, doing precisely what she was doing now; and<br>yet it was as though then and now she had been two different<br>beings. Where had she gone, that well-meaning, ridiculous girl who<br>had prayed ecstatically in summer-scented fields and pricked her<br>arm as a punishment for sacrilegious thoughts? And where is any of<br>ourselves of even a year ago? And yet after all--and here lay the<br>trouble--she WAS the same girl. Beliefs change, thoughts change,<br>but there is some inner part of the soul that does not change.<br>Faith vanishes, but the need for faith remains the same as before.<br><br>And given only faith, how can anything else matter? How can<br>anything dismay you if only there is some purpose in the world<br>which you can serve, and which, while serving it, you can<br>understand? Your whole life is illumined by the sense of purpose.<br>There is no weariness in your heart, no doubts, no feeling of<br>futility, no Baudelairean ennui waiting for unguarded hours. Every<br>act is significant, every moment sanctified, woven by faith as into<br>a pattern, a fabric of never-ending joy.<br><br>She began to meditate upon the nature of life. You emerged from<br>the womb, you lived sixty or seventy years, and then you died and<br>rotted. And in every detail of your life, if no ultimate purpose<br>redeemed it, there was a quality of greyness, of desolation, that<br>could never be described, but which you could feel like a physical<br>pang at your heart. Life, if the grave really ends it, is<br>monstrous and dreadful. No use trying to argue it away. Think of<br>life as it really is, think of the DETAILS of life; and then think<br>that there is no meaning in it, no purpose, no goal except the<br>grave. Surely only fools or self-deceivers, or those whose lives<br>are exceptionally fortunate, can face that thought without<br>flinching?<br><br>She shifted her position in her chair. But after all there must be<br>SOME meaning, SOME purpose in it all! The world cannot be an<br>accident. Everything that happens must have a cause--ultimately,<br>therefore, a purpose. Since you exist, God must have created you,<br>and since He created you a conscious being, He must be conscious.<br>The greater doesn't come out of the less. He created you, and He<br>will kill you, for His own purpose. But that purpose is inscrutable.<br>It is in the nature of things that you can never discover it, and<br>perhaps even if you did discover it you would be averse to it.<br>Your life and death, it may be, are a single note in the eternal<br>orchestra that plays for His diversion. And suppose you don't like<br>the tune? She thought of that dreadful unfrocked clergyman in<br>Trafalgar Square. Had she dreamed the things he said, or had he<br>really said them? 'Therefore with Demons and Archdemons and with<br>all the company of Hell'. But that was silly, really. For your not<br>liking the tune was also part of the tune.<br><br>Her mind struggled with the problem, while perceiving that there<br>was no solution. There was, she saw clearly, no possible<br>substitute for faith; no pagan acceptance of life as sufficient to<br>itself, no pantheistic cheer-up stuff, no pseudo-religion of<br>'progress' with visions of glittering Utopias and ant-heaps of<br>steel and concrete. It is all or nothing. Either life on earth is<br>a preparation for something greater and more lasting, or it is<br>meaningless, dark, and dreadful.<br><br>Dorothy started. A frizzling sound was coming from the glue-pot.<br>She had forgotten to put any water in the saucepan, and the glue<br>was beginning to burn. She took the saucepan, hastened to the<br>scullery sink to replenish it, then brought it back and put it on<br>the oilstove again. I simply MUST get that breastplate done before<br>supper! she thought. After Julius Caesar there was William the<br>Conqueror to be thought of. More armour! And presently she must<br>go along to the kitchen and remind Ellen to boil some potatoes to<br>go with the minced beef for supper; also there was her 'memo list'<br>to be written out for tomorrow. She shaped the two halves of the<br>breastplate, cut out the armholes and neckholes, and then stopped<br>again.<br><br>Where had she got to? She had been saying that if death ends all,<br>then there is no hope and no meaning in anything. Well, what then?<br><br>The action of going to the scullery and refilling the saucepan had<br>changed the tenor of her thoughts. She perceived, for a moment at<br>least, that she had allowed herself to fall into exaggeration and<br>self-pity. What a fuss about nothing, after all! As though in<br>reality there were not people beyond number in the same case as<br>herself! All over the world, thousands, millions of them; people<br>who had lost their faith without losing their need of faith. 'Half<br>the parsons' daughters in England,' Mr Warburton had said. He was<br>probably right. And not only parsons' daughters; people of every<br>description--people in illness and loneliness and failure, people<br>leading thwarted, discouraging lives--people who needed faith to<br>support them, and who hadn't got it. Perhaps even nuns in<br>convents, scrubbing floors and singing Ave Marias, secretly<br>unbelieving.<br><br>And how cowardly, after all, to regret a superstition that you had<br>got rid of--to want to believe something that you knew in your<br>bones to be untrue!<br><br>And yet--!<br><br>Dorothy had put down her scissors. Almost from force of habit, as<br>though her return home, which had not restored her faith, had<br>restored the outward habits of piety, she knelt down beside her<br>chair. She buried her face in her hands. She began to pray.<br><br>'Lord, I believe, help Thou my unbelief. Lord, I believe, I<br>believe; help Thou my unbelief.'<br><br>It was useless, absolutely useless. Even as she spoke the words<br>she was aware of their uselessness, and was half ashamed of her<br>action. She raised her head. And at that moment there stole into<br>her nostrils a warm, evil smell, forgotten these eight months but<br>unutterably familiar--the smell of glue. The water in the saucepan<br>was bubbling noisily. Dorothy jumped to her feet and felt the<br>handle of the glue-brush. The glue was softening--would be liquid<br>in another five minutes.<br><br>The grandfather clock in her father's study struck six. Dorothy<br>started. She realized that she had wasted twenty minutes, and her<br>conscience stabbed her so hard that all the questions that had been<br>worrying her fled out of her mind. What on earth have I been doing<br>all this time? she thought; and at that moment it really seemed to<br>her that she did not know what she had been doing. She admonished<br>herself. Come on, Dorothy! No slacking, please! You've got to<br>get that breastplate done before supper. She sat down, filled her<br>mouth with pins and began pinning the two halves of the breastplate<br>together, to get it into shape before the glue should be ready.<br><br>The smell of glue was the answer to her prayer. She did not know<br>this. She did not reflect, consciously, that the solution to her<br>difficulty lay in accepting the fact that there was no solution;<br>that if one gets on with the job that lies to hand, the ultimate<br>purpose of the job fades into insignificance; that faith and no<br>faith are very much the same provided that one is doing what is<br>customary, useful, and acceptable. She could not formulate these<br>thoughts as yet, she could only live them. Much later, perhaps,<br>she would formulate them and draw comfort from them.<br><br>There was still a minute or two before the glue would be ready to<br>use. Dorothy finished pinning the breastplate together, and in the<br>same instant began mentally sketching the innumerable costumes that<br>were yet to be made. After William the Conqueror--was it chain<br>mail in William the Conqueror's day?--there were Robin Hood--<br>Lincoln Green and a bow and arrow--and Thomas a Becket in his cope<br>and mitre, and Queen Elizabeth's ruff, and a cocked hat for the<br>Duke of Wellington. And I must go and see about those potatoes at<br>half past six, she thought. And there was her 'memo list' to be<br>written out for tomorrow. Tomorrow was Wednesday--mustn't forget<br>to set the alarm clock for half past five. She took a slip of<br>paper and began writing out the 'memo list':<br><br><br>7 oc. H.C.<br><br>Mrs J. baby next month go and see her.<br><br>BREAKFAST. Bacon.<br><br><br>She paused to think of fresh items. Mrs J. was Mrs Jowett, the<br>blacksmith's wife; she came sometimes to be churched after her<br>babies were born, but only if you coaxed her tactfully beforehand.<br>And I must take old Mrs Frew some paregoric lozenges, Dorothy<br>thought, and then perhaps she'll speak to Georgie and stop him<br>eating those biscuits during the sermon. She added Mrs Frew to her<br>list. And then what about tomorrow's dinner--luncheon? We simply<br>MUST pay Cargill something! she thought. And tomorrow was the day<br>of the Mothers' Union tea, and they had finished the novel that<br>Miss Foote had been reading to them. The question was, what to get<br>for them next? There didn't seem to be any more books by Gene<br>Stratton Porter, their favourite. What about Warwick Deeping? Too<br>highbrow, perhaps? And I must ask Proggett to get us some young<br>cauliflowers to plant out, she thought finally.<br><br>The glue had liquefied. Dorothy took two fresh sheets of brown<br>paper, sliced them into narrow strips, and--rather awkwardly,<br>because of the difficulty of keeping the breastplate convex--pasted<br>the strips horizontally across it, back and front. By degrees it<br>stiffened under her hands. When she had reinforced it all over she<br>set it on end to look at it. It really wasn't half bad! One more<br>coating of paper and it would be almost like real armour. We MUST<br>make that pageant a success! she thought. What a pity we can't<br>borrow a horse from somebody and have Boadicea in her chariot! We<br>might make five pounds if we had a really good chariot, with<br>scythes on the wheels. And what about Hengist and Horsa? Cross-<br>gartering and winged helmets. Dorothy sliced two more sheets of<br>brown paper into strips, and took up the breastplate to give it its<br>final coating. The problem of faith and no faith had vanished<br>utterly from her mind. It was beginning to get dark, but, too busy<br>to stop and light the lamp, she worked on, pasting strip after<br>strip of paper into place, with absorbed, with pious concentration,<br>in the penetrating smell of the glue-pot. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/A_Clergyman's_Daughter/3.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center></font></p>
