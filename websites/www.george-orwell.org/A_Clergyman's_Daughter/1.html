<h2>Chapter 2</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>1<br><br><br>Out of a black, dreamless sleep, with the sense of being drawn<br>upwards through enormous and gradually lightening abysses, Dorothy<br>awoke to a species of consciousness.<br><br>Her eyes were still closed.  By degrees, however, their lids became<br>less opaque to the light, and then flickered open of their own<br>accord.  She was looking out upon a street--a shabby, lively street<br>of small shops and narrow-faced houses, with streams of men, trams,<br>and cars passing in either direction.<br><br>But as yet it could not properly be said that she was LOOKING.  For<br>the things she saw were not apprehended as men, trams, and cars,<br>nor as anything in particular; they were not even apprehended as<br>things moving; not even as THINGS.  She merely SAW, as an animal<br>sees, without speculation and almost without consciousness.  The<br>noises of the street--the confused din of voices, the hooting of<br>horns and the scream of the trams grinding on their gritty rails--<br>flowed through her head provoking purely physical responses.  She<br>had no words, nor any conception of the purpose of such things as<br>words, nor any consciousness of time or place, or of her own body<br>or even of her own existence.<br><br>Nevertheless, by degrees her perceptions became sharper.  The<br>stream of moving things began to penetrate beyond her eyes and sort<br>themselves out into separate images in her brain.  She began, still<br>wordlessly, to observe the shapes of things.  A long-shaped thing<br>swam past, supported on four other, narrower long-shaped things,<br>and drawing after it a square-shaped thing balanced on two circles.<br>Dorothy watched it pass; and suddenly, as though spontaneously, a<br>word flashed into her mind.  The word was 'horse'.  It faded, but<br>returned presently in the more complex form:  'THAT IS A HORSE.'<br>Other words followed--'house', 'street', 'tram', 'car', 'bicycle'--<br>until in a few minutes she had found a name for almost everything<br>within sight.  She discovered the words 'man' and 'woman', and,<br>speculating upon these words, discovered that she knew the<br>difference between living and inanimate things, and between human<br>beings and horses, and between men and women.<br><br>It was only now, after becoming aware of most of the things about<br>her, that she became aware of HERSELF.  Hitherto she had been as it<br>were a pair of eyes with a receptive but purely impersonal brain<br>behind them.  But now, with a curious little shock, she discovered<br>her separate and unique existence; she could FEEL herself existing;<br>it was as though something within her were exclaiming 'I am I!'<br>Also, in some way she knew that this 'I' had existed and been the<br>same from remote periods in the past, though it was a past of which<br>she had no remembrance.<br><br>But it was only for a moment that this discovery occupied her.<br>From the first there was a sense of incompleteness in it, of<br>something vaguely unsatisfactory.  And it was this: the 'I am I'<br>which had seemed an answer had itself become a question.  It was no<br>longer 'I am I', but 'WHO am I'?<br><br>WHO WAS SHE?  She turned the question over in her mind, and found<br>that she had not the dimmest notion of who she was; except that,<br>watching the people and horses passing, she grasped that she was a<br>human being and not a horse.  And that the question altered itself<br>and took this form:  'Am I a man or a woman?'  Again neither<br>feeling nor memory gave any clue to the answer.  But at that<br>moment, by accident possibly, her finger-tips brushed against her<br>body.  She realized more clearly than before that her body existed,<br>and that it was her own--that it was, in fact, herself.  She began<br>to explore it with her hands, and her hands encountered breasts.<br>She was a woman, therefore.  Only women had breasts.  In some way<br>she knew, without knowing how she knew, that all those women who<br>passed had breasts beneath their clothes, though she could not see<br>them.<br><br>She now grasped that in order to identify herself she must examine<br>her own body, beginning with her face; and for some moments she<br>actually attempted to look at her own face, before realizing that<br>this was impossible.  She looked down, and saw a shabby black satin<br>dress, rather long, a pair of flesh-coloured artificial silk<br>stockings, laddered and dirty, and a pair of very shabby black<br>satin shoes with high heels.  None of them was in the least<br>familiar to her.  She examined her hands, and they were both<br>strange and unstrange.  They were smallish hands, with hard palms,<br>and very dirty.  After a moment she realized that it was their<br>dirtiness that made them strange to her.  The hands themselves<br>seemed natural and appropriate, though she did not recognize them.<br><br>After hesitating a few moments longer, she turned to her left and<br>began to walk slowly along the pavement.  A fragment of knowledge<br>had come to her, mysteriously, out of the blank past: the existence<br>of mirrors, their purpose, and the fact that there are often<br>mirrors in shop windows.  After a moment she came to a cheap little<br>jeweller's shop in which a strip of mirror, set at an angle,<br>reflected the faces of people passing.  Dorothy picked her<br>reflection out from among a dozen others, immediately realizing it<br>to be her own.  Yet it could not be said that she had recognized<br>it; she had no memory of ever having seen it till this moment.  It<br>showed her a woman's youngish face, thin, very blonde, with crow's-<br>feet round the eyes, and faintly smudged with dirt.  A vulgar black<br>cloche hat was stuck carelessly on the head, concealing most of the<br>hair.  The face was quite unfamiliar to her, and yet not strange.<br>She had not known till this moment what face to expect, but now<br>that she had seen it she realized that it was the face she might<br>have expected.  It was appropriate.  It corresponded to something<br>within her.<br><br>As she turned away from the jeweller's mirror, she caught sight of<br>the words 'Fry's Chocolate' on a shop window opposite, and<br>discovered that she understood the purpose of writing, and also,<br>after a momentary effort, that she was able to read.  Her eyes<br>flitted across the street, taking in and deciphering odd scraps of<br>print; the names of shops, advertisements, newspaper posters.  She<br>spelled out the letters of two red and white posters outside a<br>tobacconist's shop.  One of them read, 'Fresh Rumours about<br>Rector's Daughter', and the other, 'Rector's Daughter.  Now<br>believed in Paris'.  Then she looked upwards, and saw in white<br>lettering on the corner of a house:  'New Kent Road'.  The words<br>arrested her.  She grasped that she was standing in the New Kent<br>Road, and--another fragment of her mysterious knowledge--the New<br>Kent Road was somewhere in London.  So she was in London.<br><br>As she made this discovery a peculiar tremor ran through her.  Her<br>mind was now fully awakened; she grasped, as she had not grasped<br>before, the strangeness of her situation, and it bewildered and<br>frightened her.  What could it all MEAN?  What was she doing here?<br>How had she got here?  What had happened to her?<br><br>The answer was not long in coming.  She thought--and it seemed to<br>her that she understood perfectly well what the words meant:  'Of<br>course!  I've lost my memory!'<br><br>At this moment two youths and a girl who were trudging past, the<br>youths with clumsy sacking bundles on their backs, stopped and<br>looked curiously at Dorothy.  They hesitated for a moment, then<br>walked on, but halted again by a lamp-post five yards away.<br>Dorothy saw them looking back at her and talking among themselves.<br>One of the youths was about twenty, narrow-chested, black-haired,<br>ruddy-cheeked, good-looking in a nosy cockney way, and dressed in<br>the wreck of a raffishly smart blue suit and a check cap.  The<br>other was about twenty-six, squat, nimble, and powerful, with a<br>snub nose, a clear pink skin and huge lips as coarse as sausages,<br>exposing strong yellow teeth.  He was frankly ragged, and he had a<br>mat of orange-coloured hair cropped short and growing low on his<br>head, which gave him a startling resemblance to an orang-outang.<br>The girl was a silly-looking, plump creature, dressed in clothes<br>very like Dorothy's own.  Dorothy could hear some of what they were<br>saying:<br><br>'That tart looks ill,' said the girl.<br><br>The orange-headed one, who was singing 'Sonny Boy' in a good<br>baritone voice, stopped singing to answer.  'She ain't ill,' he<br>said.  'She's on the beach all right, though.  Same as us.'<br><br>'She'd do jest nicely for Nobby, wouldn't she?' said the dark-<br>haired one.<br><br>'Oh, YOU!' exclaimed the girl with a shocked-amorous air, pretending<br>to smack the dark one over the head.<br><br>The youths had lowered their bundles and leaned them against the<br>lamp-post.  All three of them now came rather hesitantly towards<br>Dorothy, the orange-headed one, whose name seemed to be Nobby,<br>leading the way as their ambassador.  He moved with a gambolling,<br>apelike gait, and his grin was so frank and wide that it was<br>impossible not to smile back at him.  He addressed Dorothy in a<br>friendly way.<br><br>'Hullo, kid!'<br><br>'Hullo!'<br><br>'You on the beach, kid?'<br><br>'On the beach?'<br><br>'Well, on the bum?'<br><br>'On the bum?'<br><br>'Christ! she's batty,' murmured the girl, twitching at the black-<br>haired one's arm as though to pull him away.<br><br>'Well, what I mean to say, kid--have you got any money?'<br><br>'I don't know.'<br><br>At this all three looked at one another in stupefaction.  For a<br>moment they probably thought that Dorothy really WAS batty.  But<br>simultaneously Dorothy, who had earlier discovered a small pocket<br>in the side of her dress, put her hand into it and felt the outline<br>of a large coin.<br><br>'I believe I've got a penny,' she said.<br><br>'A penny!' said the dark youth disgustedly, '--lot of good that is<br>to us!'<br><br>Dorothy drew it out.  It was a half-crown.  An astonishing change<br>came over the faces of the three others.  Nobby's mouth split open<br>with delight, he gambolled several steps to and fro like some great<br>jubilant ape, and then, halting, took Dorothy confidentially by the<br>arm.<br><br>'That's the mulligatawny!' he said.  'We've struck it lucky--and<br>so've you, kid, believe me.  You're going to bless the day you set<br>eyes on us lot.  We're going to make your fortune for you, we are.<br>Now, see here, kid--are you on to go into cahoots with us three?'<br><br>'What?' said Dorothy.<br><br>'What I mean to say--how about you chumming in with Flo and Charlie<br>and me?  Partners, see?  Comrades all, shoulder to shoulder.<br>United we stand, divided we fall.  We put up the brains, you put up<br>the money.  How about it, kid?  Are you on, or are you off?'<br><br>'Shut up, Nobby!' interrupted the girl.  'She don't understand a<br>word of what you're saying.  Talk to her proper, can't you?'<br><br>'That'll do, Flo,' said Nobby equably.  'You keep it shut and leave<br>the talking to me.  I got a way with the tarts, I have.  Now, you<br>listen to me, kid--what might your name happen to be, kid?'<br><br>Dorothy was within an ace of saying 'I don't know,' but she was<br>sufficiently on the alert to stop herself in time.  Choosing a<br>feminine name from the half-dozen that sprang immediately into her<br>mind, she answered, 'Ellen.'<br><br>'Ellen.  That's the mulligatawny.  No surnames when you're on the<br>bum.  Well now, Ellen dear, you listen to me.  Us three are going<br>down hopping, see--'<br><br>'Hopping?'<br><br>''Opping!' put in the dark youth impatiently, as though disgusted<br>by Dorothy's ignorance.  His voice and manner were rather sullen,<br>and his accent much baser than Nobby's.  'Pickin' 'ops--dahn in<br>Kent!  C'n understand that, can't yer?'<br><br>'Oh, HOPS!  For beer?'<br><br>'That's the mulligatawny!  Coming on fine, she is.  Well, kid, 'z I<br>was saying, here's us three going down hopping, and got a job<br>promised us and all--Blessington's farm, Lower Molesworth.  Only<br>we're just a bit in the mulligatawny, see?  Because we ain't got a<br>brown between us, and we got to do it on the toby--thirty-five<br>miles it is--and got to tap for our tommy and skipper at night as<br>well.  And that's a bit of a mulligatawny, with ladies in the<br>party.  But now s'pose f'rinstance you was to come along with us,<br>see?  We c'd take the twopenny tram far as Bromley, and that's<br>fifteen miles done, and we won't need skipper more'n one night on<br>the way.  And you can chum in at our bin--four to a bin's the best<br>picking--and if Blessington's paying twopence a bushel you'll turn<br>your ten bob a week easy.  What do you say to it, kid?  Your two<br>and a tanner won't do you much good here in Smoke.  But you go into<br>partnership with us, and you'll get your kip for a month and<br>something over--and WE'LL get a lift to Bromley and a bit of scran<br>as well.'<br><br>About a quarter of his speech was intelligible to Dorothy.  She<br>asked rather at random:<br><br>'What is SCRAN?'<br><br>'Scran?  Tommy--food.  I can see YOU ain't been long on the beach,<br>kid.'<br><br>'Oh. . . .  Well, you want me to come down hop-picking with you, is<br>that it?'<br><br>'That's it, Ellen my dear.  Are you on, or are you off?'<br><br>'All right,' said Dorothy promptly.  'I'll come.'<br><br>She made this decision without any misgiving whatever.  It is true<br>that if she had had time to think over her position, she would<br>probably have acted differently; in all probability she would have<br>gone to a police station and asked for assistance.  That would have<br>been the sensible course to take.  But Nobby and the others had<br>appeared just at the critical moment, and, helpless as she was, it<br>seemed quite natural to throw in her lot with the first human being<br>who presented himself.  Moreover, for some reason which she did not<br>understand, it reassured her to hear that they were making for<br>Kent.  Kent, it seemed to her, was the very place to which she<br>wanted to go.  The others showed no further curiosity, and asked no<br>uncomfortable questions.  Nobby simply said, 'O.K.  That's the<br>mulligatawny!' and then gently took Dorothy's half-crown out of her<br>hand and slid it into his pocket--in case she should lose it, he<br>explained.  The dark youth--apparently his name was Charlie--said<br>in his surly, disagreeable way:<br><br>'Come on, less get movin'!  It's 'ar-parse two already.  We don't<br>want to miss that there ---- tram.  Where d'they start from,<br>Nobby?'<br><br>'The Elephant,' said Nobby: 'and we got to catch it before four<br>o'clock, because they don't give no free rides after four.'<br><br>'Come on, then, don't less waste no more time.  Nice job we'll 'ave<br>of it if we got to 'ike it down to Bromley AND look for a place to<br>skipper in the ---- dark.  C'm on, Flo.'<br><br>'Quick march!' said Nobby, swinging his bundle on to his shoulder.<br><br>They set out, without more words said, Dorothy, still bewildered<br>but feeling much better than she had felt half an hour ago, walked<br>beside Flo and Charlie, who talked to one another and took no<br>further notice of her.  From the very first they seemed to hold<br>themselves a little aloof from Dorothy--willing enough to share her<br>half-crown, but with no friendly feelings towards her.  Nobby<br>marched in front, stepping out briskly in spite of his burden, and<br>singing, with spirited imitations of military music, the well-known<br>military song of which the only recorded words seem to be:<br><br><br>'"----!" was all the band could play;<br>"----! ----!"  And the same to you!'<br><br><br><br>2<br><br><br>This was the twenty-ninth of August.  It was on the night of the<br>twenty-first that Dorothy had fallen asleep in the conservatory; so<br>that there had been an interregnum in her life of not quite eight<br>days.<br><br>The thing that had happened to her was commonplace enough--almost<br>every week one reads in the newspapers of a similar case.  A man<br>disappears from home, is lost sight of for days or weeks, and<br>presently fetches up at a police station or in a hospital, with no<br>notion of who he is or where he has come from.  As a rule it is<br>impossible to tell how he has spent the intervening time; he has<br>been wandering, presumably, in some hypnotic or somnambulistic<br>state in which he has nevertheless been able to pass for normal.<br>In Dorothy's case only one thing is certain, and that is that she<br>had been robbed at some time during her travels; for the clothes<br>she was wearing were not her own, and her gold cross was missing.<br><br>At the moment when Nobby accosted her, she was already on the road<br>to recovery; and if she had been properly cared for, her memory<br>might have come back to her within a few days or even hours.  A<br>very small thing would have been enough to accomplish it; a chance<br>meeting with a friend, a photograph of her home, a few questions<br>skilfully put.  But as it was, the slight mental stimulus that she<br>needed was never given.  She was left in the peculiar state in<br>which she had first found herself--a state in which her mind was<br>potentially normal, but not quite strung up to the effort of<br>puzzling out her own identity.<br><br>For of course, once she had thrown in her lot with Nobby and the<br>others, all chance of reflection was gone.  There was no time to<br>sit down and think the matter over--no time to come to grips with<br>her difficulty and reason her way to its solution.  In the strange,<br>dirty sub-world into which she was instantly plunged, even five<br>minutes of consecutive thought would have been impossible.  The<br>days passed in ceaseless nightmarish activity.  Indeed, it was very<br>like a nightmare; a nightmare not of urgent terrors, but of hunger,<br>squalor, and fatigue, and of alternating heat and cold.  Afterwards,<br>when she looked back upon that time, days and nights merged<br>themselves together so that she could never remember with perfect<br>certainty how many of them there had been.  She only knew that for<br>some indefinite period she had been perpetually footsore and almost<br>perpetually hungry.  Hunger and the soreness of her feet were her<br>clearest memories of that time; and also the cold of the nights, and<br>a peculiar, blowsy, witless feeling that came of sleeplessness and<br>constant exposure to the air.<br><br>After getting to Bromley they had 'drummed up' on a horrible,<br>paper-littered rubbish dump, reeking with the refuse of several<br>slaughter-houses, and then passed a shuddering night, with only<br>sacks for cover, in long wet grass on the edge of a recreation<br>ground.  In the morning they had started out, on foot, for the<br>hopfields.  Even at this early date Dorothy had discovered that the<br>tale Nobby had told her, about the promise of a job, was totally<br>untrue.  He had invented it--he confessed this quite light-<br>heartedly--to induce her to come with them.  Their only chance of<br>getting a job was to march down into the hop country and apply at<br>every farm till they found one where pickers were still needed.<br><br>They had perhaps thirty-five miles to go, as the crow flies, and<br>yet at the end of three days they had barely reached the fringe of<br>the hopfields.  The need of getting food, of course, was what<br>slowed their progress.  They could have marched the whole distance<br>in two days or even in a day if they had not been obliged to feed<br>themselves.  As it was, they had hardly even time to think of<br>whether they were going in the direction of the hopfields or not;<br>it was food that dictated all their movements.  Dorothy's half-<br>crown had melted within a few hours, and after that there was<br>nothing for it except to beg.  But there came the difficulty.  One<br>person can beg his food easily enough on the road, and even two can<br>manage it, but it is a very different matter when there are four<br>people together.  In such circumstances one can only keep alive if<br>one hunts for food as persistently and single-mindedly as a wild<br>beast.  Food--that was their sole preoccupation during those three<br>days--just food, and the endless difficulty of getting it.<br><br>From morning to night they were begging.  They wandered enormous<br>distances, zigzagging right across the country, trailing from<br>village to village and from house to house, 'tapping' at every<br>butcher's and every baker's and every likely looking cottage, and<br>hanging hopefully round picnic parties, and waving--always vainly--<br>at passing cars, and accosting old gentlemen with the right kind of<br>face and pitching hard-up stories.  Often they went five miles out<br>of their way to get a crust of bread or a handful of scraps of<br>bacon.  All of them begged, Dorothy with the others; she had no<br>remembered past, no standards of comparison to make her ashamed of<br>it.  And yet with all their efforts they would have gone empty-<br>bellied half the time if they had not stolen as well as begged.<br>At dusk and in the early mornings they pillaged the orchards and<br>the fields, stealing apples, damsons, pears, cobnuts, autumn<br>raspberries, and, above all, potatoes; Nobby counted it a sin to<br>pass a potato field without getting at least a pocketful.  It was<br>Nobby who did most of the stealing, while the others kept guard.<br>He was a bold thief; it was his peculiar boast that he would steal<br>anything that was not tied down, and he would have landed them all<br>in prison if they had not restrained him sometimes.  Once he even<br>laid hands on a goose, but the goose set up a fearful clamour, and<br>Charlie and Dorothy dragged Nobby off just as the owner came out of<br>doors to see what was the matter.<br><br>Each of those first days they walked between twenty and twenty-five<br>miles.  They trailed across commons and through buried villages<br>with incredible names, and lost themselves in lanes that led<br>nowhere, and sprawled exhausted in dry ditches smelling of fennel<br>and tansies, and sneaked into private woods and 'drummed up' in<br>thickets where firewood and water were handy, and cooked strange,<br>squalid meals in the two two-pound snuff-tins that were their only<br>cooking pots.  Sometimes, when their luck was in, they had<br>excellent stews of cadged bacon and stolen cauliflowers, sometimes<br>great insipid gorges of potatoes roasted in the ashes, sometimes<br>jam made of stolen autumn raspberries which they boiled in one of<br>the snuff-tins and devoured while it was still scalding hot.  Tea<br>was the one thing they never ran short of.  Even when there was no<br>food at all there was always tea, stewed, dark brown and reviving.<br>It is a thing that can be begged more easily than most.  'Please,<br>ma'am, could you spare me a pinch of tea?' is a plea that seldom<br>fails, even with the case-hardened Kentish housewives.<br><br>The days were burning hot, the white roads glared and the passing<br>cars sent stinging dust into their faces.  Often families of hop-<br>pickers drove past, cheering, in lorries piled sky-high with<br>furniture, children, dogs, and birdcages.  The nights were always<br>cold.  There is hardly such a thing as a night in England when it<br>is really warm after midnight.  Two large sacks were all the<br>bedding they had between them.  Flo and Charlie had one sack,<br>Dorothy had the other, and Nobby slept on the bare ground.  The<br>discomfort was almost as bad as the cold.  If you lay on your back,<br>your head, with no pillow, lolled backwards so that your neck<br>seemed to be breaking; if you lay on your side, your hip-bone<br>pressing against the earth caused you torments.  Even when, towards<br>the small hours, you managed to fall asleep by fits and starts, the<br>cold penetrated into your deepest dreams.  Nobby was the only one<br>who could really stand it.  He could sleep as peacefully in a nest<br>of sodden grass as in a bed, and his coarse, simian face, with<br>barely a dozen red-gold hairs glittering on the chin like snippings<br>of copper wire, never lost its warm, pink colour.  He was one of<br>those red-haired people who seem to glow with an inner radiance<br>that warms not only themselves but the surrounding air.<br><br>All this strange, comfortless life Dorothy took utterly for<br>granted--only dimly aware, if at all, that the other, unremembered<br>life that lay behind her had been in some way different from this.<br>After only a couple of days she had ceased to wonder any longer<br>about her queer predicament.  She accepted everything--accepted the<br>dirt and hunger and fatigue, the endless trailing to and fro, the<br>hot, dusty days and the sleepless, shivering nights.  She was, in<br>any case, far too tired to think.  By the afternoon of the second<br>day they were all desperately, overwhelmingly tired, except Nobby,<br>whom nothing could tire.  Even the fact that soon after they set<br>out a nail began to work its way through the sole of his boot<br>hardly seemed to trouble him.  There were periods of an hour at a<br>time when Dorothy seemed almost to be sleeping as she walked.  She<br>had a burden to carry now, for as the two men were already loaded<br>and Flo steadfastly refused to carry anything, Dorothy had<br>volunteered to carry the sack that held the stolen potatoes.  They<br>generally had ten pounds or so of potatoes in reserve.  Dorothy<br>slung the sack over her shoulder as Nobby and Charlie did with<br>their bundles, but the string cut into her like a saw and the sack<br>bumped against her hip and chafed it so that finally it began to<br>bleed.  Her wretched, flimsy shoes had begun to go to pieces from<br>the very beginning.  On the second day the heel of her right shoe<br>came off and left her hobbling; but Nobby, expert in such matters,<br>advised her to tear the heel off the other shoe and walk<br>flatfooted.  The result was a fiery pain down her shins when she<br>walked uphill, and a feeling as though the soles of her feet had<br>been hammered with an iron bar.<br><br>But Flo and Charlie were in a much worse case than she.  They were<br>not so much exhausted as amazed and scandalized by the distances<br>they were expected to walk.  Walking twenty miles in a day was a<br>thing they had never heard of till now.  They were cockneys born<br>and bred, and though they had had several months of destitution in<br>London, neither of them had ever been on the road before.  Charlie,<br>till fairly recently, had been in good employment, and Flo, too,<br>had had a good home until she had been seduced and turned out of<br>doors to live on the streets.  They had fallen in with Nobby in<br>Trafalgar Square and agreed to come hop-picking with him, imagining<br>that it would be a bit of a lark.  Of course, having been 'on the<br>beach' a comparatively short time, they looked down on Nobby and<br>Dorothy.  They valued Nobby's knowledge of the road and his<br>boldness in thieving, but he was their social inferior--that was<br>their attitude.  And as for Dorothy, they scarcely even deigned to<br>look at her after her half-crown came to an end.<br><br>Even on the second day their courage was failing.  They lagged<br>behind, grumbled incessantly, and demanded more than their fair<br>share of food.  By the third day it was almost impossible to keep<br>them on the road at all.  They were pining to be back in London,<br>and had long ceased to care whether they ever got to the hopfields<br>or not; all they wanted to do was to sprawl in any comfortable<br>halting place they could find, and, when there was any food left,<br>devour endless snacks.  After every halt there was a tedious<br>argument before they could be got to their feet again.<br><br>'Come on, blokes!' Nobby would say.  'Pack your peter up, Charlie.<br>Time we was getting off.'<br><br>'Oh, ---- getting off!' Charlie would answer morosely.<br><br>'Well, we can't skipper here, can we?  We said we was going to hike<br>as far as Sevenoaks tonight, didn't we?'<br><br>'Oh, ---- Sevenoaks!  Sevenoaks or any other bleeding place--it<br>don't make any bleeding difference to me.'<br><br>'But ---- it!  We want to get a job tomorrow, don't we?  And we got<br>to get down among the farms 'fore we can start looking for one.'<br><br>'Oh, ---- the farms!  I wish I'd never 'eard of a ---- 'op!  I<br>wasn't brought up to this ---- 'iking and skippering like you was.<br>I'm fed up; that's what I am ---- fed up.'<br><br>'If this is bloody 'opping,' Flo would chime in, 'I've 'ad my<br>bloody bellyful of it already.'<br><br>Nobby gave Dorothy his private opinion that Flo and Charlie would<br>probably 'jack off' if they got the chance of a lift back to<br>London.  But as for Nobby, nothing disheartened him or ruffled his<br>good temper, not even when the nail in his boot was at its worst<br>and his filthy remnant of a sock was dark with blood.  By the third<br>day the nail had worn a permanent hole in his foot, and Nobby had<br>to halt once in a mile to hammer it down.<br><br>''Scuse me, kid,' he would say; 'got to attend to my bloody hoof<br>again.  This nail's a mulligatawny.'<br><br>He would search for a round stone, squat in the ditch and carefully<br>hammer the nail down.<br><br>'There!' he would say optimistically, feeling the place with his<br>thumb.  'THAT b--'s in his grave!'<br><br>The epitaph should have been Resurgam, however.  The nail<br>invariably worked its way up again within a quarter of an hour.<br><br>Nobby had tried to make love to Dorothy, of course, and, when she<br>repulsed him, bore her no grudge.  He had that happy temperament<br>that is incapable of taking its own reverses very seriously.  He<br>was always debonair, always singing in a lusty baritone voice--his<br>three favourite songs were:  'Sonny Boy', ''Twas Christmas Day in<br>the Workhouse' (to the tune of 'The Church's One Foundation'), and<br>'"----!" was all the band could play', given with lively renderings<br>of military music.  He was twenty-six years old and was a widower,<br>and had been successively a seller of newspapers, a petty thief,<br>a Borstal boy, a soldier, a burglar, and a tramp.  These facts,<br>however, you had to piece together for yourself, for he was not<br>equal to giving a consecutive account of his life.  His conversation<br>was studded with casual picturesque memories--the six months he had<br>served in a line regiment before he was invalided out with a damaged<br>eye, the loathsomeness of the skilly in Holloway, his childhood in<br>the Deptford gutters, the death of his wife, aged eighteen, in<br>childbirth, when he was twenty, the horrible suppleness of the<br>Borstal canes, the dull boom of the nitro- glycerine, blowing in the<br>safe door at Woodward's boot and shoe factory, where Nobby had<br>cleared a hundred and twenty-five pounds and spent it in three<br>weeks.<br><br>On the afternoon of the third day they reached the fringe of the<br>hop country, and began to meet discouraged people, mostly tramps,<br>trailing back to London with the news that there was nothing doing--<br>hops were bad and the price was low, and the gypsies and 'home<br>pickers' had collared all the jobs.  At this Flo and Charlie gave<br>up hope altogether, but by an adroit mixture of bullying and<br>persuasion Nobby managed to drive them a few miles farther.  In a<br>little village called Wale they fell in with an old Irishwoman--<br>Mrs McElligot was her name--who had just been given a job at a<br>neighbouring hopfield, and they swapped some of their stolen apples<br>for a piece of meat she had 'bummed' earlier in the day.  She gave<br>them some useful hints about hop-picking and about what farms to<br>try.  They were all sprawling on the village green, tired out,<br>opposite a little general shop with some newspaper posters outside.<br><br>'You'd best go down'n have a try at Chalmers's,' Mrs McElligot<br>advised them in her base Dublin accent.  'Dat's a bit above five<br>mile from here.  I've heard tell as Chalmers wants a dozen pickers<br>still.  I daresay he'd give y'a job if you gets dere early enough.'<br><br>'Five miles!  Cripes!  Ain't there none nearer'n that?' grumbled<br>Charlie.<br><br>'Well, dere's Norman's.  I got a job at Norman's meself--I'm<br>startin' tomorrow mornin'.  But 'twouldn't be no use for you to try<br>at Norman's.  He ain't takin' on none but home pickers, an' dey say<br>as he's goin' to let half his hops blow.'<br><br>'What's home pickers?' said Nobby.<br><br>'Why, dem as has got homes o' deir own.  Eider you got to live in<br>de neighbourhood, or else de farmer's got to give y'a hut to sleep<br>in.  Dat's de law nowadays.  In de ole days when you come down<br>hoppin', you kipped in a stable an' dere was no questions asked.<br>But dem bloody interferin' gets of a Labour Government brought in a<br>law to say as no pickers was to be taken on widout de farmer had<br>proper accommodation for 'em.  So Norman only takes on folks as has<br>got homes o' deir own.'<br><br>'Well, you ain't got a home of your own, have you?'<br><br>'No bloody fear!  But Norman t'inks I have.  I kidded'm I was<br>stayin' in a cottage near by.  Between you an' me, I'm skipperin'<br>in a cow byre.  'Tain't so bad except for de stink o' de muck, but<br>you got to be out be five in de mornin', else de cowmen 'ud catch<br>you.'<br><br>'We ain't got no experience of hopping,' Nobby said.  'I wouldn't<br>know a bloody hop if I saw one.  Best to let on you're an old hand<br>when you go up for a job, eh?'<br><br>'Hell!  Hops don't need no experience.  Tear 'em off an' fling 'em<br>into de bin.  Dat's all der is to it, wid hops.'<br><br>Dorothy was nearly asleep.  She heard the others talking desultorily,<br>first about hop-picking, then about some story in the newspapers of<br>a girl who had disappeared from home.  Flo and Charlie had been<br>reading the posters on the shop-front opposite; and this had revived<br>them somewhat, because the posters reminded them of London and its<br>joys.  The missing girl, in whose fate they seemed to be rather<br>interested, was spoken of as 'The Rector's Daughter'.<br><br>'J'a see that one, Flo?' said Charlie, reading a poster aloud with<br>intense relish:  '"Secret Love Life of Rector's Daughter.<br>Startling Revelations."  Coo!  Wish I 'ad a penny to 'ave a read of<br>that!'<br><br>'Oh?  What's 't all about, then?'<br><br>'What?  Didn't j'a read about it?  Papers 'as bin full of it.<br>Rector's Daughter this and Rector's Daughter that--wasn't 'alf<br>smutty, some of it, too.'<br><br>'She's bit of hot stuff, the ole Rector's Daughter,' said Nobby<br>reflectively, lying on his back.  'Wish she was here now!  I'd know<br>what to do with her, all right, I would.'<br><br>''Twas a kid run away from home,' put in Mrs McElligot.  'She was<br>carryin' on wid a man twenty year older'n herself, an' now she's<br>disappeared an' dey're searchin' for her high an' low.'<br><br>'Jacked off in the middle of the night in a motor-car with no<br>clo'es on 'cep' 'er nightdress,' said Charlie appreciatively.  'The<br>'ole village sore 'em go.'<br><br>'Dere's some t'ink as he's took her abroad an' sold her to one o'<br>dem flash cat-houses in Parrus,' added Mrs McElligot.<br><br>'No clo'es on 'cep' 'er nightdress?  Dirty tart she must 'a been!'<br><br>The conversation might have proceeded to further details, but at<br>this moment Dorothy interrupted it.  What they were saying had<br>roused a faint curiosity in her.  She realized that she did not<br>know the meaning of the word 'Rector'.  She sat up and asked Nobby:<br><br>'What is a Rector?'<br><br>'Rector?  Why, a sky-pilot--parson bloke.  Bloke that preaches and<br>gives out the hymns and that in church.  We passed one of 'em<br>yesterday--riding a green bicycle and had his collar on back to<br>front.  A priest--clergyman.  YOU know.'<br><br>'Oh. . . .  Yes, I think so.'<br><br>'Priests!  Bloody ole getsies dey are too, some o' dem,' said Mrs<br>McElligot reminiscently.<br><br>Dorothy was left not much the wiser.  What Nobby had said did<br>enlighten her a little, but only a very little.  The whole train of<br>thought connected with 'church' and 'clergyman' was strangely vague<br>and blurred in her mind.  It was one of the gaps--there was a<br>number of such gaps--in the mysterious knowledge that she had<br>brought with her out of the past.<br><br>That was their third night on the road.  When it was dark they<br>slipped into a spinney as usual to 'skipper', and a little after<br>midnight it began to pelt with rain.  They spent a miserable hour<br>stumbling to and fro in the darkness, trying to find a place to<br>shelter, and finally found a hay-stack, where they huddled<br>themselves on the lee side till it was light enough to see.  Flo<br>blubbered throughout the night in the most intolerable manner, and<br>by the morning she was in a state of semi-collapse.  Her silly fat<br>face, washed clean by rain and tears, looked like a bladder of<br>lard, if one can imagine a bladder of lard contorted with self-<br>pity.  Nobby rooted about under the hedge until he had collected an<br>armful of partially dry sticks, and then managed to get a fire<br>going and boil some tea as usual.  There was no weather so bad that<br>Nobby could not produce a can of tea.  He carried, among other<br>things, some pieces of old motor tyre that would make a flare when<br>the wood was wet, and he even possessed the art, known only to a<br>few cognoscenti among tramps, of getting water to boil over a<br>candle.<br><br>Everyone's limbs had stiffened after the horrible night, and Flo<br>declared herself unable to walk a step farther.  Charlie backed her<br>up.  So, as the other two refused to move, Dorothy and Nobby went<br>on to Chalmers's farm, arranging a rendezvous where they should<br>meet when they had tried their luck.  They got to Chalmers's, five<br>miles away, found their way through vast orchards to the hop-<br>fields, and were told that the overseer 'would be along presently'.<br>So they waited four hours on the edge of the plantation, with the<br>sun drying their clothes on their backs, watching the hop-pickers<br>at work.  It was a scene somehow peaceful and alluring.  The hop<br>bines, tall climbing plants like runner beans enormously magnified,<br>grew in green leafy lanes, with the hops dangling from them in pale<br>green bunches like gigantic grapes.  When the wind stirred them<br>they shook forth a fresh, bitter scent of sulphur and cool beer.<br>In each lane of bines a family of sunburnt people were shredding<br>the hops into sacking bins, and singing as they worked; and<br>presently a hooter sounded and they knocked off to boil cans of tea<br>over crackling fires of hop bines.  Dorothy envied them greatly.<br>How happy they looked, sitting round the fires with their cans of<br>tea and their hunks of bread and bacon, in the smell of hops and<br>wood smoke!  She pined for such a job--however, for the present<br>there was nothing doing.  At about one o'clock the overseer arrived<br>and told them that he had no jobs for them, so they trailed back to<br>the road, only avenging themselves on Chalmers's farm by stealing a<br>dozen apples as they went.<br><br>When they reached their rendezvous, Flo and Charlie had vanished.<br>Of course they searched for them, but, equally of course, they knew<br>very well what had happened.  Indeed, it was perfectly obvious.<br>Flo had made eyes at some passing lorry driver, who had given the<br>two of them a lift back to London for the chance of a good cuddle<br>on the way.  Worse yet, they had stolen both bundles.  Dorothy and<br>Nobby had not a scrap of food left, not a crust of bread nor a<br>potato nor a pinch of tea, no bedding, and not even a snuff-tin in<br>which to cook anything they could cadge or steal--nothing, in fact,<br>except the clothes they stood up in.<br><br>The next thirty-six hours were a bad time--a very bad time.  How<br>they pined for a job, in their hunger and exhaustion!  But the<br>chances of getting one seemed to grow smaller and smaller as they<br>got farther into the hop country.  They made interminable marches<br>from farm to farm, getting the same answer everywhere--no pickers<br>needed--and they were so busy marching to and fro that they had not<br>even time to beg, so that they had nothing to eat except stolen<br>apples and damsons that tormented their stomachs with their acid<br>juice and yet left them ravenously hungry.  It did not rain that<br>night, but it was much colder than before.  Dorothy did not even<br>attempt to sleep, but spent the night in crouching over the fire<br>and keeping it alight.  They were hiding in a beech wood, under a<br>squat, ancient tree that kept the wind away but also wetted them<br>periodically with sprinklings of chilly dew.  Nobby, stretched on<br>his back, mouth open, one broad cheek faintly illumined by the<br>feeble rays of the fire, slept as peacefully as a child.  All night<br>long a vague wonder, born of sleeplessness and intolerable<br>discomfort, kept stirring in Dorothy's mind.  Was this the life to<br>which she had been bred--this life of wandering empty-bellied all<br>day and shivering at night under dripping trees?  Had it been like<br>this even in the blank past?  Where had she come from?  Who was<br>she?  No answer came, and they were on the road at dawn.  By the<br>evening they had tried at eleven farms in all, and Dorothy's legs<br>were giving out, and she was so dizzy with fatigue that she found<br>difficulty in walking straight.<br><br>But late in the evening, quite unexpectedly, their luck turned.<br>They tried at a farm named Cairns's, in the village of Clintock,<br>and were taken on immediately, with no questions asked.  The<br>overseer merely looked them up and down, said briefly, 'Right you<br>are--you'll do.  Start in the morning; bin number 7, set 19,' and<br>did not even bother to ask their names.  Hop-picking, it seemed,<br>needed neither character nor experience.<br><br>They found their way to the meadow where the pickers' camp was<br>situated.  In a dreamlike state, between exhaustion and the joy of<br>having got a job at last, Dorothy found herself walking through a<br>maze of tin-roofed huts and gypsies' caravans with many-coloured<br>washing hanging from the windows.  Hordes of children swarmed in<br>the narrow grass alleys between the huts, and ragged, agreeable-<br>looking people were cooking meals over innumerable faggot fires.<br>At the bottom of the field there were some round tin huts, much<br>inferior to the others, set apart for unmarried people.  An old man<br>who was toasting cheese at a fire directed Dorothy to one of the<br>women's huts.<br><br>Dorothy pushed open the door of the hut.  It was about twelve feet<br>across, with unglazed windows which had been boarded up, and it had<br>no furniture whatever.  There seemed to be nothing in it but an<br>enormous pile of straw reaching to the roof--in fact, the hut was<br>almost entirely filled with straw.  To Dorothy's eyes, already<br>sticky with sleep, the straw looked paradisically comfortable.  She<br>began to push her way into it, and was checked by a sharp yelp from<br>beneath her.<br><br>"Ere!  What yer doin' of?  Get off of it!  'Oo asked YOU to walk<br>about on my belly, stoopid?'<br><br>Seemingly there were women down among the straw.  Dorothy burrowed<br>forward more circumspectly, tripped over something, sank into the<br>straw and in the same instant began to fall asleep.  A rough-<br>looking woman, partially undressed, popped up like a mermaid from<br>the strawy sea.<br><br>''Ullo, mate!' she said.  'Jest about all in, ain't you, mate?'<br><br>'Yes, I'm tired--very tired.'<br><br>'Well, you'll bloody freeze in this straw with no bed-clo'es on<br>you.  Ain't you got a blanket?'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>''Alf a mo, then.  I got a poke 'ere.'<br><br>She dived down into the straw and re-emerged with a hop-poke seven<br>feet long.  Dorothy was asleep already.  She allowed herself to be<br>woken up, and inserted herself somehow into the sack, which was so<br>long that she could get into it head and all; and then she was half<br>wriggling, half sinking down, deep down, into a nest of straw<br>warmer and drier than she had conceived possible.  The straw<br>tickled her nostrils and got into her hair and pricked her even<br>through the sack, but at that moment no imaginable sleeping place--<br>not Cleopatra's couch of swan's-down nor the floating bed of Haroun<br>al Raschid--could have caressed her more voluptuously.<br><br><br><br>3<br><br><br>It was remarkable how easily, once you had got a job, you settled<br>down to the routine of hop-picking.  After only a week of it you<br>ranked as an expert picker, and felt as though you had been picking<br>hops all your life.<br><br>It was exceedingly easy work.  Physically, no doubt, it was<br>exhausting--it kept you on your feet ten or twelve hours a day, and<br>you were dropping with sleep by six in the evening--but it needed<br>no kind of skill.  Quite a third of the pickers in the camp were as<br>new to the job as Dorothy herself.  Some of them had come down from<br>London with not the dimmest idea of what hops were like, or how you<br>picked them, or why.  One man, it was said, on his first morning on<br>the way to the fields, had asked, 'Where are the spades?'  He<br>imagined that hops were dug up out of the ground.<br><br>Except for Sundays, one day at the hop camp was very like another.<br>At half past five, at a tap on the wall of your hut, you crawled<br>out of your sleeping nest and began searching for your shoes, amid<br>sleepy curses from the women (there were six or seven or possibly<br>even eight of them) who were buried here and there in the straw.<br>In that vast pile of straw any clothes that you were so unwise as<br>to take off always lost themselves immediately.  You grabbed an<br>armful of straw and another of dried hop bines, and a faggot from<br>the pile outside, and got the fire going for breakfast.  Dorothy<br>always cooked Nobby's breakfast as well as her own, and tapped on<br>the wall of his hut when it was ready, she being better at waking<br>up in the morning than he.  It was very cold on those September<br>mornings, the eastern sky was fading slowly from black to cobalt,<br>and the grass was silvery white with dew.  Your breakfast was<br>always the same--bacon, tea, and bread fried in the grease of the<br>bacon.  While you ate it you cooked another exactly similar meal,<br>to serve for dinner, and then, carrying your dinner-pail, you set<br>out for the fields, a mile-and-a-half walk through the blue, windy<br>dawn, with your nose running so in the cold that you had to stop<br>occasionally and wipe it on your sacking apron.<br><br>The hops were divided up into plantations of about an acre, and<br>each set--forty pickers or thereabouts, under a foreman who was<br>often a gypsy--picked one plantation at a time.  The bines grew<br>twelve feet high or more, and they were trained up strings and<br>slung over horizontal wires, in rows a yard or two apart; in each<br>row there was a sacking bin like a very deep hammock slung on a<br>heavy wooden frame.  As soon as you arrived you swung your bin into<br>position, slit the strings from the next two bines, and tore them<br>down--huge, tapering strands of foliage, like the plaits of<br>Rapunzel's hair, that came tumbling down on top of you, showering<br>you with dew.  You dragged them into place over the bin, and then,<br>starting at the thick end of the bine, began tearing off the heavy<br>bunches of hops.  At that hour of the morning you could only pick<br>slowly and awkwardly.  Your hands were still stiff and the coldness<br>of the dew numbed them, and the hops were wet and slippery.  The<br>great difficulty was to pick the hops without picking the leaves<br>and stalks as well; for the measurer was liable to refuse your hops<br>if they had too many leaves among them.<br><br>The stems of the bines were covered with minute thorns which within<br>two or three days had torn the skin of your hands to pieces.  In<br>the morning it was a torment to begin picking when your fingers<br>were almost too stiff to bend and bleeding in a dozen places; but<br>the pain wore off when the cuts had reopened and the blood was<br>flowing freely.  If the hops were good and you picked well, you<br>could strip a bine in ten minutes, and the best bines yielded half<br>a bushel of hops.  But the hops varied greatly from one plantation<br>to another.  In some they were as large as walnuts, and hung in<br>great leafless bunches which you could rip off with a single twist;<br>in others they were miserable things no bigger than peas, and grew<br>so thinly that you had to pick them one at a time.  Some hops were<br>so bad that you could not pick a bushel of them in an hour.<br><br>It was slow work in the early morning, before the hops were dry<br>enough to handle.  But presently the sun came out, and the lovely,<br>bitter odour began to stream from the warming hops, and people's<br>early-morning surliness wore off, and the work got into its stride.<br>From eight till midday you were picking, picking, picking, in a<br>sort of passion of work--a passionate eagerness, which grew<br>stronger and stronger as the morning advanced, to get each bine<br>done and shift your bin a little farther along the row.  At the<br>beginning of each plantation all the bins started abreast, but by<br>degrees the better pickers forged ahead, and some of them had<br>finished their lane of hops when the others were barely halfway<br>along; whereupon, if you were far behind, they were allowed to turn<br>back and finish your row for you, which was called 'stealing your<br>hops'.  Dorothy and Nobby were always among the last, there being<br>only two of them--there were four people at most of the bins.  And<br>Nobby was a clumsy picker, with his great coarse hands; on the<br>whole, the women picked better than the men.<br><br>It was always a neck and neck race between the two bins on either<br>side of Dorothy and Nobby, bin number 6 and bin number 8.  Bin<br>number 6 was a family of gypsies--a curly-headed, ear-ringed<br>father, an old dried-up leather-coloured mother, and two strapping<br>sons--and bin number 8 was an old East End costerwoman who wore a<br>broad hat and long black cloak and took snuff out of a papiermache<br>box with a steamer painted on the lid.  She was always helped by<br>relays of daughters and granddaughters who came down from London<br>for two days at a time.  There was quite a troop of children<br>working with the set, following the bins with baskets and gathering<br>up the fallen hops while the adults picked.  And the old<br>costerwoman's tiny, pale granddaughter Rose, and a little gypsy<br>girl, dark as an Indian, were perpetually slipping off to steal<br>autumn raspberries and make swings out of hop bines; and the<br>constant singing round the bins was pierced by shrill cries from<br>the costerwoman of, 'Go on, Rose, you lazy little cat!  Pick them<br>'ops up!  I'll warm your a-- for you!' etc., etc.<br><br>Quite half the pickers in the set were gypsies--there were not less<br>than two hundred of them in the camp.  Diddykies, the other pickers<br>called them.  They were not a bad sort of people, friendly enough,<br>and they flattered you grossly when they wanted to get anything out<br>of you; yet they were sly, with the impenetrable slyness of<br>savages.  In their oafish, Oriental faces there was a look as of<br>some wild but sluggish animal--a look of dense stupidity existing<br>side by side with untameable cunning.  Their talk consisted of<br>about half a dozen remarks which they repeated over and over again<br>without ever growing tired of them.  The two young gypsies at bin<br>number 6 would ask Nobby and Dorothy as many as a dozen times a day<br>the same conundrum:<br><br>'What is it the cleverest man in England couldn't do?'<br><br>'I don't know.  What?'<br><br>'Tickle a gnat's a-- with a telegraph pole.'<br><br>At this, never-failing bellows of laughter.  They were all<br>abysmally ignorant; they informed you with pride that not one of<br>them could read a single word.  The old curly-headed father, who<br>had conceived some dim notion that Dorothy was a 'scholard', once<br>seriously asked her whether he could drive his caravan to New York.<br><br>At twelve o'clock a hooter down at the farm signalled to the<br>pickers to knock off work for an hour, and it was generally a<br>little before this that the measurer came round to collect the<br>hops.  At a warning shout from the foreman of ''Ops ready, number<br>nineteen!' everyone would hasten to pick up the fallen hops, finish<br>off the tendrils that had been left unpicked here and there, and<br>clear the leaves out of the bin.  There was an art in that.  It did<br>not pay to pick too 'clean', for leaves and hops alike all went to<br>swell the tally.  The old hands, such as the gypsies, were adepts<br>at knowing just how 'dirty' it was safe to pick.<br><br>The measurer would come round, carrying a wicker basket which held<br>a bushel, and accompanied by the 'bookie,' who entered the pickings<br>of each bin in a ledger.  The 'bookies' were young men, clerks and<br>chartered accountants and the like, who took this job as a paying<br>holiday.  The measurer would scoop the hops out of the bin a bushel<br>at a time, intoning as he did so, 'One!  Two!  Three!  Four!' and<br>the pickers would enter the number in their tally books.  Each<br>bushel they picked earned them twopence, and naturally there were<br>endless quarrels and accusations of unfairness over the measuring.<br>Hops are spongy things--you can crush a bushel of them into a quart<br>pot if you choose; so after each scoop one of the pickers would<br>lean over into the bin and stir the hops up to make them lie<br>looser, and then the measurer would hoist the end of the bin and<br>shake the hops together again.  Some mornings he had orders to<br>'take them heavy', and would shovel them in so that he got a couple<br>of bushels at each scoop, whereat there were angry yells of, 'Look<br>how the b--'s ramming them down!  Why don't you bloody well stamp<br>on them?' etc.; and the old hands would say darkly that they had<br>known measurers to be ducked in cowponds on the last day of<br>picking.  From the bins the hops were put into pokes which<br>theoretically held a hundredweight; but it took two men to hoist a<br>full poke when the measurer had been 'taking them heavy'.  You had<br>an hour for dinner, and you made a fire of hop bines--this was<br>forbidden, but everyone did it--and heated up your tea and ate your<br>bacon sandwiches.  After dinner you were picking again till five or<br>six in the evening, when the measurer came once more to take your<br>hops, after which you were free to go back to the camp.<br><br>Looking back, afterwards, upon her interlude of hop-picking, it was<br>always the afternoons that Dorothy remembered.  Those long,<br>laborious hours in the strong sunlight, in the sound of forty<br>voices singing, in the smell of hops and wood smoke, had a quality<br>peculiar and unforgettable.  As the afternoon wore on you grew<br>almost too tired to stand, and the small green hop lice got into<br>your hair and into your ears and worried you, and your hands, from<br>the sulphurous juice, were as black as a Negro's except where they<br>were bleeding.  Yet you were happy, with an unreasonable happiness.<br>The work took hold of you and absorbed you.  It was stupid work,<br>mechanical, exhausting, and every day more painful to the hands,<br>and yet you never wearied of it; when the weather was fine and the<br>hops were good you had the feeling that you could go on picking for<br>ever and for ever.  It gave you a physical joy, a warm satisfied<br>feeling inside you, to stand there hour after hour, tearing off the<br>heavy clusters and watching the pale green pile grow higher and<br>higher in your bin, every bushel another twopence in your pocket.<br>The sun burned down upon you, baking you brown, and the bitter,<br>never-palling scent, like a wind from oceans of cool beer, flowed<br>into your nostrils and refreshed you.  When the sun was shining<br>everybody sang as they worked; the plantations rang with singing.<br>For some reason all the songs were sad that autumn--songs about<br>rejected love and fidelity unrewarded, like gutter versions of<br>Carmen and Manon Lescaut.  There was:<br><br><br>THERE they GO--IN their joy--<br>'APPY girl--LUCKY boy--<br>But 'ere am _I-I-I_--<br>Broken--'A-A-Arted!<br><br><br>And there was:<br><br><br>But I'm dan--cing with tears--in my eyes--<br>'Cos the girl--in my arms--isn't you-o-ou!<br><br><br>And:<br><br><br>The bells--are ringing--for Sally--<br>But no-o-ot--for Sally--and me!<br><br><br>The little gypsy girl used to sing over and over again:<br><br><br>We're so misable, all so misable,<br>Down on Misable Farm!<br><br><br>And though everyone told her that the name of it was Misery Farm,<br>she persisted in calling it Misable Farm.  The old costerwoman and<br>her granddaughter Rose had a hop-picking song which went:<br><br><br>'Our lousy 'ops!<br>Our lousy 'ops!<br>When the measurer 'e comes round,<br>Pick 'em up, pick 'em up off the ground!<br>When 'e comes to measure,<br>'E never knows where to stop;<br>Ay, ay, get in the bin<br>And take the bloody lot!'<br><br><br>'There they go in their joy', and 'The bells are ringing for<br>Sally', were the especial favourites.  The pickers never grew tired<br>of singing them; they must have sung both of them several hundred<br>times over before the season came to an end.  As much a part of the<br>atmosphere of the hopfields as the bitter scent and the blowsy<br>sunlight were the tunes of those two songs, ringing through the<br>leafy lanes of the bines.<br><br>When you got back to the camp, at half past six or thereabouts, you<br>squatted down by the stream that ran past the huts, and washed your<br>face, probably for the first time that day.  It took you twenty<br>minutes or so to get the coal-black filth off your hands.  Water<br>and even soap made no impression on it; only two things would<br>remove it--one of them was mud, and the other, curiously enough,<br>was hop juice.  Then you cooked your supper, which was usually<br>bread and tea and bacon again, unless Nobby had been along to the<br>village and bought two pennyworth of pieces from the butcher.  It<br>was always Nobby who did the shopping.  He was the sort of man who<br>knows how to get four pennyworth of meat from the butcher for<br>twopence, and, besides, he was expert in tiny economies.  For<br>instance, he always bought a cottage loaf in preference to any of<br>the other shapes, because, as he used to point out, a cottage loaf<br>seems like two loaves when you tear it in half.<br><br>Even before you had eaten your supper you were dropping with sleep,<br>but the huge fires that people used to build between the huts were<br>too agreeable to leave.  The farm allowed two faggots a day for<br>each hut, but the pickers plundered as many more as they wanted,<br>and also great lumps of elm root which kept smouldering till<br>morning.  On some nights the fires were so enormous that twenty<br>people could sit round them in comfort, and there was singing far<br>into the night, and telling of stories and roasting of stolen<br>apples.  Youths and girls slipped off to the dark lanes together,<br>and a few bold spirits like Nobby set out with sacks and robbed the<br>neighbouring orchards, and the children played hide-and-seek in the<br>dusk and harried the nightjars which haunted the camp and which, in<br>their cockney ignorance, they imagined to be pheasants.  On<br>Saturday nights fifty or sixty of the pickers used to get drunk in<br>the pub and then march down the village street roaring bawdy songs,<br>to the scandal of the inhabitants, who looked on the hopping season<br>as decent provincials in Roman Gaul might have looked on the yearly<br>incursion of the Goths.<br><br>When finally you managed to drag yourself away to your nest in the<br>straw, it was none too warm or comfortable.  After that first<br>blissful night, Dorothy discovered that straw is wretched stuff to<br>sleep in.  It is not only prickly, but, unlike hay, it lets in the<br>draught from every possible direction.  However, you had the chance<br>to steal an almost unlimited number of hop-pokes from the fields,<br>and by making herself a sort of cocoon of four hop-pokes, one on<br>top of the other, she managed to keep warm enough to sleep at any<br>rate five hours a night.<br><br><br><br>4<br><br><br>As to what you earned by hop-picking, it was just enough to keep<br>body and soul together, and no more.<br><br>The rate of pay at Cairns's was twopence a bushel, and given good<br>hops a practised picker can average three bushels an hour.  In<br>theory, therefore, it would have been possible to earn thirty<br>shillings by a sixty-hour week.  Actually, no one in the camp came<br>anywhere near this figure.  The best pickers of all earned thirteen<br>or fourteen shillings a week, and the worst hardly as much as six<br>shillings.  Nobby and Dorothy, pooling their hops and dividing the<br>proceeds, made round about ten shillings a week each.<br><br>There were various reasons for this.  To begin with, there was the<br>badness of the hops in some of the fields.  Again, there were the<br>delays which wasted an hour or two of every day.  When one<br>plantation was finished you had to carry your bin to the next,<br>which might be a mile distant; and then perhaps it would turn out<br>that there was some mistake, and the set, struggling under their<br>bins (they weighed a hundredweight), would have to waste another<br>half-hour in traipsing elsewhere.  Worst of all, there was the<br>rain.  It was a bad September that year, raining one day in three.<br>Sometimes for a whole morning or afternoon you shivered miserably<br>in the shelter of the unstripped bines, with a dripping hop-poke<br>round your shoulders, waiting for the rain to stop.  It was<br>impossible to pick when it was raining.  The hops were too slippery<br>to handle, and if you did pick them it was worse than useless, for<br>when sodden with water they shrank all to nothing in the bin.<br>Sometimes you were in the fields all day to earn a shilling or<br>less.<br><br>This did not matter to the majority of the pickers, for quite half<br>of them were gypsies and accustomed to starvation wages, and most<br>of the others were respectable East Enders, costermongers and small<br>shopkeepers and the like, who came hop-picking for a holiday and<br>were satisfied if they earned enough for their fare both ways and a<br>bit of fun on Saturday nights.  The farmers knew this and traded on<br>it.  Indeed, were it not that hop-picking is regarded as a holiday,<br>the industry would collapse forthwith, for the price of hops is now<br>so low that no farmer could afford to pay his pickers a living<br>wage.<br><br>Twice a week you could 'sub' up to the amount of half your<br>earnings.  If you left before the picking was finished (an<br>inconvenient thing for the farmers) they had the right to pay you<br>off at the rate of a penny a bushel instead of twopence--that is,<br>to pocket half of what they owed you.  It was also common knowledge<br>that towards the end of the season, when all the pickers had a fair<br>sum owing to them and would not want to sacrifice it by throwing up<br>their jobs, the farmer would reduce the rate of payment from<br>twopence a bushel to a penny halfpenny.  Strikes were practically<br>impossible.  The pickers had no union, and the foremen of the sets,<br>instead of being paid twopence a bushel like the others, were paid<br>a weekly wage which stopped automatically if there was a stri<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/A_Clergyman's_Daughter/0.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/A_Clergyman's_Daughter/2.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
