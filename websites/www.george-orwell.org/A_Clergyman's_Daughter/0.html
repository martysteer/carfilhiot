<h2>Chapter 1</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br>1<br><br><br>As the alarm clock on the chest of drawers exploded like a horrid<br>little bomb of bell metal, Dorothy, wrenched from the depths of<br>some complex, troubling dream, awoke with a start and lay on her<br>back looking into the darkness in extreme exhaustion.<br><br>The alarm clock continued its nagging, feminine clamour, which<br>would go on for five minutes or thereabouts if you did not stop it.<br>Dorothy was aching from head to foot, and an insidious and<br>contemptible self-pity, which usually seized upon her when it was<br>time to get up in the morning, caused her to bury her head under<br>the bedclothes and try to shut the hateful noise out of her ears.<br>She struggled against her fatigue, however, and, according to her<br>custom, exhorted herself sharply in the second person plural.  Come<br>on, Dorothy, up you get!  No snoozing, please!  Proverbs vi, 9.<br>Then she remembered that if the noise went on any longer it would<br>wake her father, and with a hurried movement she bounded out of<br>bed, seized the clock from the chest of drawers, and turned off the<br>alarm.  It was kept on the chest of drawers precisely in order that<br>she should have to get out of bed to silence it.  Still in<br>darkness, she knelt down at her bedside and repeated the Lord's<br>Prayer, but rather distractedly, her feet being troubled by the<br>cold.<br><br>It was just half past five, and coldish for an August morning.<br>Dorothy (her name was Dorothy Hare, and she was the only child of<br>the Reverend Charles Hare, Rector of St Athelstan's, Knype Hill,<br>Suffolk) put on her aged flannelette dressing-gown and felt her way<br>downstairs.  There was a chill morning smell of dust, damp plaster,<br>and the fried dabs from yesterday's supper, and from either side of<br>the passage on the second floor she could hear the antiphonal<br>snoring of her father and of Ellen, the maid of all work.  With<br>care--for the kitchen table had a nasty trick of reaching out of<br>the darkness and banging you on the hip-bone--Dorothy felt her way<br>into the kitchen, lighted the candle on the mantelpiece, and, still<br>aching with fatigue, knelt down and raked the ashes out of the<br>range.<br><br>The kitchen fire was a 'beast' to light.  The chimney was crooked<br>and therefore perpetually half choked, and the fire, before it<br>would light, expected to be dosed with a cupful of kerosene, like a<br>drunkard's morning nip of gin.  Having set the kettle to boil for<br>her father's shaving-water, Dorothy went upstairs and turned on her<br>bath.  Ellen was still snoring, with heavy youthful snores.  She<br>was a good hard-working servant once she was awake, but she was one<br>of those girls whom the Devil and all his angels cannot get out of<br>bed before seven in the morning.<br><br>Dorothy filled the bath as slowly as possible--the splashing always<br>woke her father if she turned on the tap too fast--and stood for a<br>moment regarding the pale, unappetizing pool of water.  Her body<br>had gone goose-flesh all over.  She detested cold baths; it was for<br>that very reason that she made it a rule to take all her baths cold<br>from April to November.  Putting a tentative hand into the water--<br>and it was horribly cold--she drove herself forward with her usual<br>exhortations.  Come on, Dorothy!  In you go!  No funking, please!<br>Then she stepped resolutely into the bath, sat down and let the icy<br>girdle of water slide up her body and immerse her all except her<br>hair, which she had twisted up behind her head.  The next moment<br>she came to the surface gasping and wriggling, and had no sooner<br>got her breath back than she remembered her 'memo list', which she<br>had brought down in her dressing-gown pocket and intended to read.<br>She reached out for it, and, leaning over the side of the bath,<br>waist deep in icy water, read through the 'memo list' by the light<br>of the candle on the chair.<br><br>It ran:<br><br><br>7 oc.  H.C.<br><br>Mrs T baby?  Must visit.<br><br>BREAKFAST.  Bacon.  MUST ask father money.  (P)<br><br>Ask Ellen what stuff kitchen father's tonic NB. to ask about stuff<br>for curtains at Solepipe's.<br><br>Visiting call on Mrs P cutting from Daily M angelica tea good for<br>rheumatism Mrs L's cornplaster.<br><br>12 oc.  Rehearsal Charles I.  NB. to order 1/2 lb glue 1 pot<br>aluminium paint.<br><br>DINNER (crossed out) LUNCHEON . . . ?<br><br>Take round Parish Mag NB. Mrs F owes 3/6d.<br><br>4.30 pm Mothers' U tea don't forget 2 1/2 yards casement cloth.<br><br>Flowers for church NB. 1 tin Brasso.<br><br>SUPPER.  Scrambled eggs.<br><br>Type Father's sermon what about new ribbon typewriter?<br><br>NB. to fork between peas bindweed awful.<br><br><br>Dorothy got out of her bath, and as she dried herself with a towel<br>hardly bigger than a table napkin--they could never afford decent-<br>sized towels at the Rectory--her hair came unpinned and fell down<br>over her collar-bones in two heavy strands.  It was thick, fine,<br>exceedingly pale hair, and it was perhaps as well that her father<br>had forbidden her to bob it, for it was her only positive beauty.<br>For the rest, she was a girl of middle height, rather thin, but<br>strong and shapely, and her face was her weak point.  It was a<br>thin, blonde, unremarkable kind of face, with pale eyes and a nose<br>just a shade too long; if you looked closely you could see crow's<br>feet round the eyes, and the mouth, when it was in repose, looked<br>tired.  Not definitely a spinsterish face as yet, but it certainly<br>would be so in a few years' time.  Nevertheless, strangers commonly<br>took her to be several years younger than her real age (she was not<br>quite twenty-eight) because of the expression of almost childish<br>earnestness in her eyes.  Her left forearm was spotted with tiny<br>red marks like insect bites.<br><br>Dorothy put on her nightdress again and cleaned her teeth--plain<br>water, of course; better not to use toothpaste before H.C.  After<br>all, either you are fasting or you aren't.  The R.C.s are quite<br>right there--and, even as she did so, suddenly faltered and<br>stopped.  She put her toothbrush down.  A deadly pang, an actual<br>physical pang, had gone through her viscera.<br><br>She had remembered, with the ugly shock with which one remembers<br>something disagreeable for the first time in the morning, the bill<br>at Cargill's, the butcher's, which had been owing for seven months.<br>That dreadful bill--it might be nineteen pounds or even twenty, and<br>there was hardly the remotest hope of paying it--was one of the<br>chief torments of her life.  At all hours of the night or day it<br>was waiting just round the corner of her consciousness, ready to<br>spring upon her and agonize her; and with it came the memory of a<br>score of lesser bills, mounting up to a figure of which she dared<br>not even think.  Almost involuntarily she began to pray, 'Please<br>God, let not Cargill send in his bill again today!' but the next<br>moment she decided that this prayer was worldly and blasphemous,<br>and she asked forgiveness for it.  Then she put on her dressing-<br>gown and ran down to the kitchen in hopes of putting the bill out<br>of mind.<br><br>The fire had gone out, as usual.  Dorothy relaid it, dirtying her<br>hands with coal-dust, dosed it afresh with kerosene and hung about<br>anxiously until the kettle boiled.  Father expected his shaving-<br>water to be ready at a quarter past six.  Just seven minutes late,<br>Dorothy took the can upstairs and knocked at her father's door.<br><br>'Come in, come in!' said a muffled, irritable voice.<br><br>The room, heavily curtained, was stuffy, with a masculine smell.<br>The Rector had lighted the candle on his bed-table, and was lying<br>on his side, looking at his gold watch, which he had just drawn<br>from beneath his pillow.  His hair was as white and thick as<br>thistledown.  One dark bright eye glanced irritably over his<br>shoulder at Dorothy.<br><br>'Good morning, father.'<br><br>'I do wish, Dorothy,' said the Rector indistinctly--his voice<br>always sounded muffled and senile until he put his false teeth in--<br>'you would make some effort to get Ellen out of bed in the<br>mornings.  Or else be a little more punctual yourself.'<br><br>'I'm so sorry, Father.  The kitchen fire kept going out.'<br><br>'Very well!  Put it down on the dressing-table.  Put it down and<br>draw those curtains.'<br><br>It was daylight now, but a dull, clouded morning.  Dorothy hastened<br>up to her room and dressed herself with the lightning speed which<br>she found necessary six mornings out of seven.  There was only a<br>tiny square of mirror in the room, and even that she did not use.<br>She simply hung her gold cross about her neck--plain gold cross; no<br>crucifixes, please!--twisted her hair into a knot behind, stuck a<br>number of hairpins rather sketchily into it, and threw her clothes<br>(grey jersey, threadbare Irish tweed coat and skirt, stockings not<br>quite matching the coat and skirt, and much-worn brown shoes) on to<br>herself in the space of about three minutes.  She had got to 'do<br>out' the dining-room and her father's study before church, besides<br>saying her prayers in preparation for Holy Communion, which took<br>her not less than twenty minutes.<br><br>When she wheeled her bicycle out of the front gate the morning was<br>still overcast, and the grass sodden with heavy dew.  Through the<br>mist that wreathed the hillside St Athelstan's Church loomed dimly,<br>like a leaden sphinx, its single bell tolling funereally boom!<br>boom! boom!  Only one of the bells was now in active use; the other<br>seven had been unswung from their cage and had lain silent these<br>three years past, slowly splintering the floor of the belfry<br>beneath their weight.  In the distance, from the mists below, you<br>could hear the offensive clatter of the bell in the R.C. church--a<br>nasty, cheap, tinny little thing which the Rector of St Athelstan's<br>used to compare with a muffin-bell.<br><br>Dorothy mounted her bicycle and rode swiftly up the hill, leaning<br>over her handlebars.  The bridge of her thin nose was pink in the<br>morning cold.  A redshank whistled overhead, invisible against the<br>clouded sky.  Early in the morning my song shall rise to Thee!<br>Dorothy propped her bicycle against the lychgate, and, finding her<br>hands still grey with coal-dust, knelt down and scrubbed them clean<br>in the long wet grass between the graves.  Then the bell stopped<br>ringing, and she jumped up and hastened into church, just as<br>Proggett, the sexton, in ragged cassock and vast labourer's boots,<br>was clumping up the aisle to take his place at the side altar.<br><br>The church was very cold, with a scent of candle-wax and ancient<br>dust.  It was a large church, much too large for its congregation,<br>and ruinous and more than half empty.  The three narrow islands of<br>pews stretched barely half-way down the nave, and beyond them were<br>great wastes of bare stone floor in which a few worn inscriptions<br>marked the sites of ancient graves.  The roof over the chancel was<br>sagging visibly; beside the Church Expenses box two fragments of<br>riddled beam explained mutely that this was due to that mortal foe<br>of Christendom, the death-watch beetle.  The light filtered, pale-<br>coloured, through windows of anaemic glass.  Through the open south<br>door you could see a ragged cypress and the boughs of a lime-tree,<br>greyish in the sunless air and swaying faintly.<br><br>As usual, there was only one other communicant--old Miss Mayfill,<br>of The Grange.  The attendance at Holy Communion was so bad that<br>the Rector could not even get any boys to serve him, except on<br>Sunday mornings, when the boys liked showing off in front of the<br>congregation in their cassocks and surplices.  Dorothy went into<br>the pew behind Miss Mayfill, and, in penance for some sin of<br>yesterday, pushed away the hassock and knelt on the bare stones.<br>The service was beginning.  The Rector, in cassock and short linen<br>surplice, was reciting the prayers in a swift practised voice,<br>clear enough now that his teeth were in, and curiously ungenial.<br>In his fastidious, aged face, pale as a silver coin, there was an<br>expression of aloofness, almost of contempt.  'This is a valid<br>sacrament,' he seemed to be saying, 'and it is my duty to<br>administer it to you.  But remember that I am only your priest, not<br>your friend.  As a human being I dislike you and despise you.'<br>Proggett, the sexton, a man of forty with curly grey hair and a<br>red, harassed face, stood patiently by, uncomprehending but<br>reverent, fiddling with the little communion bell which was lost in<br>his huge red hands.<br><br>Dorothy pressed her fingers against her eyes.  She had not yet<br>succeeded in concentrating her thoughts--indeed, the memory of<br>Cargill's bill was still worrying her intermittently.  The prayers,<br>which she knew by heart, were flowing through her head unheeded.<br>She raised her eyes for a moment, and they began immediately to<br>stray.  First upwards, to the headless roof-angels on whose necks<br>you could still see the sawcuts of the Puritan soldiers, then back<br>again, to Miss Mayfill's black, quasi-pork-pie hat and tremulous<br>jet ear-rings.  Miss Mayfill wore a long musty black overcoat, with<br>a little collar of greasy-looking astrakhan, which had been the<br>same ever since Dorothy could remember.  It was of some very<br>peculiar stuff, like watered silk but coarser, with rivulets of<br>black piping wandering all over it in no discoverable pattern.  It<br>might even have been that legendary and proverbial substance, black<br>bombazine.  Miss Mayfill was very old, so old that no one<br>remembered her as anything but an old woman.  A faint scent<br>radiated from her--an ethereal scent, analysable as eau-de-Cologne,<br>mothballs, and a sub-flavour of gin.<br><br>Dorothy drew a long glass-headed pin from the lapel of her coat,<br>and furtively, under cover of Miss Mayfill's back, pressed the<br>point against her forearm.  Her flesh tingled apprehensively.  She<br>made it a rule, whenever she caught herself not attending to her<br>prayers, to prick her arm hard enough to make blood come.  It was<br>her chosen form of self-discipline, her guard against irreverence<br>and sacrilegious thoughts.<br><br>With the pin poised in readiness she managed for several moments<br>to pray more collectedly.  Her father had turned one dark eye<br>disapprovingly upon Miss Mayfill, who was crossing herself at<br>intervals, a practice he disliked.  A starling chattered outside.<br>With a shock Dorothy discovered that she was looking vaingloriously<br>at the pleats of her father's surplice, which she herself had sewn<br>two years ago.  She set her teeth and drove the pin an eighth of an<br>inch into her arm.<br><br>They were kneeling again.  It was the General Confession.  Dorothy<br>recalled her eyes--wandering, alas! yet again, this time to the<br>stained-glass window on her right, designed by Sir Warde Tooke,<br>A.R.A., in 1851 and representing St Athelstan's welcome at the gate<br>of heaven by Gabriel and a legion of angels all remarkably like one<br>another and the Prince Consort--and pressed the pinpoint against a<br>different part of her arm.  She began to meditate conscientiously<br>upon the meaning of each phrase of the prayer, and so brought her<br>mind back to a more attentive state.  But even so she was all but<br>obliged to use the pin again when Proggett tinkled the bell in the<br>middle of 'Therefore with Angels and Archangels'--being visited, as<br>always, by a dreadful temptation to begin laughing at that passage.<br>It was because of a story her father had told her once, of how when<br>he was a little boy, and serving the priest at the altar, the<br>communion bell had a screw-on clapper, which had come loose; and so<br>the priest had said:  'Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and<br>with all the company of Heaven, we laud and magnify Thy glorious<br>name; evermore praising Thee, and saying, Screw it up, you little<br>fat-head, screw it up!'<br><br>As the Rector finished the consecration Miss Mayfill began to<br>struggle to her feet with extreme difficulty and slowness, like<br>some disjointed wooden creature picking itself up by sections, and<br>disengaging at each movement a powerful whiff of mothballs.  There<br>was an extraordinary creaking sound--from her stays, presumably,<br>but it was a noise as of bones grating against one another.  You<br>could have imagined that there was only a dry skeleton inside that<br>black overcoat.<br><br>Dorothy remained on her feet a moment longer.  Miss Mayfill was<br>creeping towards the altar with slow, tottering steps.  She could<br>barely walk, but she took bitter offence if you offered to help<br>her.  In her ancient, bloodless face her mouth was surprisingly<br>large, loose, and wet.  The underlip, pendulous with age, slobbered<br>forward, exposing a strip of gum and a row of false teeth as yellow<br>as the keys of an old piano.  On the upper lip was a fringe of<br>dark, dewy moustache.  It was not an appetizing mouth; not the kind<br>of mouth that you would like to see drinking out of your cup.<br>Suddenly, spontaneously, as though the Devil himself had put it<br>there, the prayer slipped from Dorothy'Beasts of England's lips:  O God, let me not<br>have to take the chalice after Miss Mayfill!<br><br>The next moment, in self-horror, she grasped the meaning of what<br>she had said, and wished that she had bitten her tongue in two<br>rather than utter that deadly blasphemy upon the altar steps.  She<br>drew the pin again from her lapel and drove it into her arm so hard<br>that it was all she could do to suppress a cry of pain.  Then she<br>stepped to the altar and knelt down meekly on Miss Mayfill's left,<br>so as to make quite sure of taking the chalice after her.<br><br>Kneeling, with head bent and hands clasped against her knees, she<br>set herself swiftly to pray for forgiveness before her father<br>should reach her with the wafer.  But the current of her thoughts<br>had been broken.  Suddenly it was quite useless attempting to pray;<br>her lips moved, but there was neither heart nor meaning in her<br>prayers.  She could hear Proggett's boots shuffling and her<br>father'Beasts of England's clear low voice murmuring 'Take and eat', she could see<br>the worn strip of red carpet beneath her knees, she could smell<br>dust and eau-de-Cologne and mothballs; but of the Body and Blood of<br>Christ, of the purpose for which she had come here, she was as<br>though deprived of the power to think.  A deadly blankness had<br>descended upon her mind.  It seemed to her that actually she COULD<br>not pray.  She struggled, collected her thoughts, uttered<br>mechanically the opening phrases of a prayer; but they were<br>useless, meaningless--nothing but the dead shells of words.  Her<br>father was holding the wafer before her in his shapely, aged hand.<br>He held it between finger and thumb, fastidiously, somehow<br>distastefully, as though it had been a spoon of medicine.  His eye<br>was upon Miss Mayfill, who was doubling herself up like a geometrid<br>caterpillar, with many creakings and crossing herself so<br>elaborately that one might have imagined that she was sketching a<br>series of braid frogs on the front of her coat.  For several<br>seconds Dorothy hesitated and did not take the wafer.  She dared<br>not take it.  Better, far better to step down from the altar than<br>to accept the sacrament with such chaos in her heart!<br><br>Then it happened that she glanced sidelong, through the open south<br>door.  A momentary spear of sunlight had pierced the clouds.  It<br>struck downwards through the leaves of the limes, and a spray of<br>leaves in the doorway gleamed with a transient, matchless green,<br>greener than jade or emerald or Atlantic waters.  It was as though<br>some jewel of unimaginable splendour had flashed for an instant,<br>filling the doorway with green light, and then faded.  A flood of<br>joy ran through Dorothy'Beasts of England's heart.  The flash of living colour had<br>brought back to her, by a process deeper than reason, her peace of<br>mind, her love of God, her power to worship.  Somehow, because of<br>the greenness of the leaves, it was again possible to pray.  O all<br>ye green things upon the earth, praise ye the Lord!  She began to<br>pray, ardently, joyfully, thankfully.  The wafer melted upon her<br>tongue.  She took the chalice from her father, and tasted with<br>repulsion, even with an added joy in this small act of self-<br>abasement, the wet imprint of Miss Mayfill's lips on its silver<br>rim.<br><br><br><br>2<br><br><br>St Athelstan's Church stood at the highest point of Knype Hill, and<br>if you chose to climb the tower you could see ten miles or so<br>across the surrounding country.  Not that there was anything worth<br>looking at--only the low, barely undulating East Anglian landscape,<br>intolerably dull in summer, but redeemed in winter by the recurring<br>patterns of the elms, naked and fanshaped against leaden skies.<br><br>Immediately below you lay the town, with the High Street running<br>east and west and dividing unequally.  The southern section of the<br>town was the ancient, agricultural, and respectable section.  On<br>the northern side were the buildings of the Blifil-Gordon sugar-<br>beet refinery, and all round and leading up to them were higgledy-<br>piggledly rows of vile yellow brick cottages, mostly inhabited by<br>the employees of the factory.  The factory employees, who made up<br>more than half of the town's two thousand inhabitants, were<br>newcomers, townfolk, and godless almost to a man.<br><br>The two pivots, or foci, about which the social life of the town<br>moved were Knype Hill Conservative Club (fully licensed), from<br>whose bow window, any time after the bar was open, the large, rosy-<br>gilled faces of the town's elite were to be seen gazing like chubby<br>goldfish from an aquarium pane; and Ye Olde Tea Shoppe, a little<br>farther down the High Street, the principal rendezvous of the Knype<br>Hill ladies.  Not to be present at Ye Olde Tea Shoppe between ten<br>and eleven every morning, to drink your 'morning coffee' and spend<br>your half-hour or so in that agreeable twitter of upper-middle-<br>class voices ('My dear, he had NINE spades to the ace-queen and he<br>went one no trump, if you please.  What, my dear, you don't mean to<br>say you're paying for my coffee AGAIN?  Oh, but my dear, it is<br>simply TOO sweet of you!  Now tomorrow I shall SIMPLY INSIST upon<br>paying for yours.  And just LOOK at dear little Toto sitting up and<br>looking such a CLEVER little man with his little black nose<br>wiggling, and he would, would he, the darling duck, he would, he<br>would, and his mother would give him a lump of sugar, she would,<br>she would.  THERE, Toto!'), was to be definitely out of Knype Hill<br>society.  The Rector in his acid way nicknamed these ladies 'the<br>coffee brigade'.  Close to the colony of sham-picturesque villas<br>inhabited by the coffee brigade, but cut off from them by its<br>larger grounds, was The Grange, Miss Mayfill's house.  It was a<br>curious, machicolated, imitation castle of dark red brick--<br>somebody's Folly, built about 1870--and fortunately almost hidden<br>among dense shrubberies.<br><br>The Rectory stood half way up the hill, with its face to the church<br>and its back to the High Street.  It was a house of the wrong age,<br>inconveniently large, and faced with chronically peeling yellow<br>plaster.  Some earlier Rector had added, at one side, a large<br>greenhouse which Dorothy used as a workroom, but which was<br>constantly out of repair.  The front garden was choked with ragged<br>fir-trees and a great spreading ash which shadowed the front rooms<br>and made it impossible to grow any flowers.  There was a large<br>vegetable garden at the back.  Proggett did the heavy digging of<br>the garden in the spring and autumn, and Dorothy did the sowing,<br>planting, and weeding in such spare time as she could command; in<br>spite of which the vegetable garden was usually an impenetrable<br>jungle of weeds.<br><br>Dorothy jumped off her bicycle at the front gate, upon which some<br>officious person had stuck a poster inscribed 'Vote for Blifil-<br>Gordon and Higher Wages!'  (There was a by-election going on, and<br>Mr Blifil-Gordon was standing in the Conservative interest.)  As<br>Dorothy opened the front door she saw two letters lying on the worn<br>coconut mat.  One was from the Rural Dean, and the other was a<br>nasty, thin-looking letter from Catkin & Palm, her father's<br>clerical tailors.  It was a bill undoubtedly.  The Rector had<br>followed his usual practice of collecting the letters that<br>interested him and leaving the others.  Dorothy was just bending<br>down to pick up the letters, when she saw, with a horrid shock of<br>dismay, an unstamped envelope sticking to the letter flap.<br><br>It was a bill--for certain it was a bill!  Moreover, as soon as she<br>set eyes on it she 'knew' that it was that horrible bill from<br>Cargill's, the butcher's.  A sinking feeling passed through her<br>entrails.  For a moment she actually began to pray that it might<br>not be Cargill's bill--that it might only be the bill for three<br>and nine from Solepipe's, the draper's, or the bill from the<br>International or the baker's or the dairy--anything except<br>Cargill's bill!  Then, mastering her panic, she took the envelope<br>from the letter-flap and tore it open with a convulsive movement.<br><br>'To account rendered: L21 7S. 9d.'<br><br>This was written in the innocuous handwriting of Mr Cargill's<br>accountant.  But underneath, in thick, accusing-looking letters,<br>was added and heavily underlined:  'Shd. like to bring to your<br>notice that this bill has been owing a VERY LONG TIME.  The<br>EARLIEST POSSIBLE settlement will oblige, S. Cargill.'<br><br>Dorothy had turned a shade paler, and was conscious of not wanting<br>any breakfast.  She thrust the bill into her pocket and went into<br>the dining-room.  It was a smallish, dark room, badly in need of<br>repapering, and, like every other room in the Rectory, it had the<br>air of having been furnished from the sweepings of an antique shop.<br>The furniture was 'good', but battered beyond repair, and the<br>chairs were so worm-eaten that you could only sit on them in safety<br>if you knew their individual foibles.  There were old, dark,<br>defaced steel engravings hanging on the walls, one of them--an<br>engraving of Van Dyck's portrait of Charles I--probably of some<br>value if it had not been ruined by damp.<br><br>The Rector was standing before the empty grate, warming himself at<br>an imaginary fire and reading a letter that came from a long blue<br>envelope.  He was still wearing his cassock of black watered silk,<br>which set off to perfection his thick white hair and his pale,<br>fine, none too amiable face.  As Dorothy came in he laid the letter<br>aside, drew out his gold watch and scrutinized it significantly.<br><br>'I'm afraid I'm a bit late, Father.'<br><br>'Yes, Dorothy, you are A BIT LATE,' said the Rector, repeating her<br>words with delicate but marked emphasis.  'You are twelve minutes<br>late, to be exact.  Don't you think, Dorothy, that when I have to<br>get up at a quarter past six to celebrate Holy Communion, and come<br>home exceedingly tired and hungry, it would be better if you could<br>manage to come to breakfast without being A BIT LATE?'<br><br>It was clear that the Rector was in what Dorothy called,<br>euphemistically, his 'uncomfortable mood'.  He had one of those<br>weary, cultivated voices which are never definitely angry and never<br>anywhere near good humour--one of those voices which seem all the<br>while to be saying, 'I really CANNOT see what you are making all<br>this fuss about!'  The impression he gave was of suffering<br>perpetually from other people's stupidity and tiresomeness.<br><br>'I'm so sorry, Father!  I simply had to go and ask after Mrs<br>Tawney.'  (Mrs Tawney was the 'Mrs T' of the 'memo list'.)  'Her<br>baby was born last night, and you know she promised me she'd come<br>and be churched after it was born.  But of course she won't if she<br>thinks we aren't taking any interest in her.  You know what these<br>women are--they seem so to hate being churched.  They'll never come<br>unless I coax them into it.'<br><br>The Rector did not actually grunt, but he uttered a small<br>dissatisfied sound as he moved towards the breakfast table.  It was<br>intended to mean, first, that it was Mrs Tawney's duty to come and<br>be churched without Dorothy's coaxing; secondly, that Dorothy had<br>no business to waste her time visiting all the riffraff of the<br>town, especially before breakfast.  Mrs Tawney was a labourer's<br>wife and lived in partibus infidelium, north of the High Street.<br>The Rector laid his hand on the back of his chair, and, without<br>speaking, cast Dorothy a glance which meant:  'Are we ready NOW?<br>Or are there to be any MORE delays?'<br><br>'I think everything's here, Father,' said Dorothy.  'Perhaps if<br>you'd just say grace--'<br><br>'Benedictus benedicat,' said the Rector, lifting the worn silver<br>coverlet off the breakfast dish.  The silver coverlet, like the<br>silver-gilt marmalade spoon, was a family heirloom; the knives and<br>forks, and most of the crockery, came from Woolworths.  'Bacon<br>again, I see,' the Rector added, eyeing the three minute rashers<br>that lay curled up on squares of fried bread.<br><br>'It's all we've got in the house, I'm afraid,' Dorothy said.<br><br>The Rector picked up his fork between finger and thumb, and with a<br>very delicate movement, as though playing at spillikins, turned one<br>of the rashers over.<br><br>'I know, of course,' he said, 'that bacon for breakfast is an<br>English institution almost as old as parliamentary government.  But<br>still, don't you think we might OCCASIONALLY have a change,<br>Dorothy?'<br><br>'Bacon's so cheap now,' said Dorothy regretfully.  'It seems a sin<br>not to buy it.  This was only fivepence a pound, and I saw some<br>quite decent-looking bacon as low as threepence.'<br><br>'Ah, Danish, I suppose?  What a variety of Danish invasions we have<br>had in this country!  First with fire and sword, and now with their<br>abominable cheap bacon.  Which has been responsible for the more<br>deaths, I wonder?'<br><br>Feeling a little better after this witticism, the Rector settled<br>himself in his chair and made a fairly good breakfast off the<br>despised bacon, while Dorothy (she was not having any bacon this<br>morning--a penance she had set herself yesterday for saying 'Damn'<br>and idling for half an hour after lunch) meditated upon a good<br>conversational opening.<br><br>There was an unspeakably hateful job in front of her--a demand for<br>money.  At the very best of times getting money out of her father<br>was next door to impossible, and it was obvious that this morning<br>he was going to be even more 'difficult' than usual.  'Difficult'<br>was another of her euphemisms.  He's had bad news, I suppose, she<br>thought despondently, looking at the blue envelope.<br><br>Probably no one who had ever spoken to the Rector for as long as<br>ten minutes would have denied that he was a 'difficult' kind of<br>man.  The secret of his almost unfailing ill humour really lay in<br>the fact that he was an anachronism.  He ought never to have been<br>born into the modern world; its whole atmosphere disgusted and<br>infuriated him.  A couple of centuries earlier, a happy pluralist<br>writing poems or collecting fossils while curates at 40 pounds a<br>year administered his parishes, he would have been perfectly at<br>home. Even now, if he had been a richer man, he might have consoled<br>himself by shutting the twentieth century out of his consciousness.<br>But to live in past ages is very expensive; you can't do it on less<br>than two thousand a year.  The Rector, tethered by his poverty to<br>the age of Lenin and the Daily Mail, was kept in a state of chronic<br>exasperation which it was only natural that he should work off on<br>the person nearest to him--usually, that is, on Dorothy.<br><br>He had been born in 1871, the younger son of the younger son of a<br>baronet, and had gone into the Church for the outmoded reason that<br>the Church is the traditional profession for younger sons.  His<br>first cure had been in a large, slummy parish in East London--a<br>nasty, hooliganish place it had been, and he looked back on it with<br>loathing.  Even in those days the lower class (as he made a point<br>of calling them) were getting decidedly out of hand.  It was a<br>little better when he was curate-in-charge at some remote place in<br>Kent (Dorothy had been born in Kent), where the decently down-<br>trodden villagers still touched their hats to 'parson'.  But by<br>that time he had married, and his marriage had been diabolically<br>unhappy; moreover, because clergymen must not quarrel with their<br>wives, its unhappiness had been secret and therefore ten times<br>worse.  He had come to Knype Hill in 1908, aged thirty-seven and<br>with a temper incurably soured--a temper which had ended by<br>alienating every man, woman, and child in the parish.<br><br>It was not that he was a bad priest, merely AS a priest.  In his<br>purely clerical duties he was scrupulously correct--perhaps a<br>little too correct for a Low Church East Anglian parish.  He<br>conducted his services with perfect taste, preached admirable<br>sermons, and got up at uncomfortable hours of the morning to<br>celebrate Holy Communion every Wednesday and Friday.  But that a<br>clergyman has any duties outside the four walls of the church was a<br>thing that had never seriously occurred to him.  Unable to afford a<br>curate, he left the dirty work of the parish entirely to his wife,<br>and after her death (she died in 1921) to Dorothy.  People used to<br>say, spitefully and untruly, that he would have let Dorothy preach<br>his sermons for him if it had been possible.  The 'lower classes'<br>had grasped from the first what was his attitude towards them, and<br>if he had been a rich man they would probably have licked his<br>boots, according to their custom; as it was, they merely hated him.<br>Not that he cared whether they hated him or not, for he was largely<br>unaware of their existence.  But even with the upper classes he had<br>got on no better.  With the County he had quarrelled one by one,<br>and as for the petty gentry of the town, as the grandson of a<br>baronet he despised them, and was at no pains to hide it.  In<br>twenty-three years he had succeeded in reducing the congregation of<br>St Athelstan's from six hundred to something under two hundred.<br><br>This was not solely due to personal reasons.  It was also because<br>the old-fashioned High Anglicanism to which the Rector obstinately<br>clung was of a kind to annoy all parties in the parish about<br>equally.  Nowadays, a clergyman who wants to keep his congregation<br>has only two courses open to him.  Either it must be Anglo-<br>Catholicism pure and simple--or rather, pure and not simple; or he<br>must be daringly modern and broad-minded and preach comforting<br>sermons proving that there is no Hell and all good religions are<br>the same.  The Rector did neither.  On the one hand, he had the<br>deepest contempt for the Anglo-Catholic movement.  It had passed<br>over his head, leaving him absolutely untouched; 'Roman Fever' was<br>his name for it.  On the other hand, he was too 'high' for the<br>older members of his congregation.  From time to time he scared<br>them almost out of their wits by the use of the fatal word<br>'Catholic', not only in its sanctified place in the Creeds, but<br>also from the pulpit.  Naturally the congregation dwindled year by<br>year, and it was the Best People who were the first to go.  Lord<br>Pockthorne of Pockthorne Court, who owned a fifth of the county, Mr<br>Leavis, the retired leather merchant, Sir Edward Huson of Crabtree<br>Hall, and such of the petty gentry as owned motor-cars, had all<br>deserted St Athelstan's.  Most of them drove over on Sunday<br>mornings to Millborough, five miles away.  Millborough was a town<br>of five thousand inhabitants, and you had your choice of two<br>churches, St Edmund's and St Wedekind's.  St Edmund's was<br>Modernist--text from Blake's 'Jerusalem' blazoned over the altar,<br>and communion wine out of liqueur glasses--and St Wedekind's was<br>Anglo-Catholic and in a state of perpetual guerrilla warfare with<br>the Bishop.  But Mr Cameron, the secretary of the Knype Hill<br>Conservative Club, was a Roman Catholic convert, and his children<br>were in the thick of the Roman Catholic literary movement.  They<br>were said to have a parrot which they were teaching to say 'Extra<br>ecclesiam nulla salus'.  In effect, no one of any standing remained<br>true to St Athelstan's, except Miss Mayfill, of The Grange.  Most<br>of Miss Mayfill's money was bequeathed to the Church--so she said;<br>meanwhile, she had never been known to put more than sixpence in<br>the collection bag, and she seemed likely to go on living for ever.<br><br>The first ten minutes of breakfast passed in complete silence.<br>Dorothy was trying to summon up courage to speak--obviously she had<br>got to start SOME kind of conversation before raising the money-<br>question--but her father was not an easy man with whom to make<br>small talk.  At times he would fall into such deep fits of<br>abstraction that you could hardly get him to listen to you; at<br>other times he was all too attentive, listened carefully to what<br>you said and then pointed out, rather wearily, that it was not<br>worth saying.  Polite platitudes--the weather, and so forth--<br>generally moved him to sarcasm.  Nevertheless, Dorothy decided to<br>try the weather first.<br><br>'It's a funny kind of day, isn't it?' she said--aware, even as she<br>made it, of the inanity of this remark.<br><br>'WHAT is funny?' inquired the Rector.<br><br>'Well, I mean, it was so cold and misty this morning, and now the<br>sun's come out and it's turned quite fine.'<br><br>'IS there anything particularly funny about that?'<br><br>That was no good, obviously.  He MUST have had bad news, she<br>thought.  She tried again.<br><br>'I do wish you'd come out and have a look at the things in the back<br>garden some time, Father.  The runner beans are doing so splendidly!<br>The pods are going to be over a foot long.  I'm going to keep all<br>the best of them for the Harvest Festival, of course.  I thought it<br>would look so nice if we decorated the pulpit with festoons of<br>runner beans and a few tomatoes hanging in among them.'<br><br>This was a faux pas.  The Rector looked up from his plate with an<br>expression of profound distaste.<br><br>'My dear Dorothy,' he said sharply, 'IS it necessary to begin<br>worrying me about the Harvest Festival already?'<br><br>'I'm sorry, Father!' said Dorothy, disconcerted.  'I didn't mean to<br>worry you.  I just thought--'<br><br>'Do you suppose', proceeded the Rector, 'it is any pleasure to me<br>to have to preach my sermon among festoons of runner beans?  I am<br>not a greengrocer.  It quite puts me off my breakfast to think of<br>it.  When is the wretched thing due to happen?'<br><br>'It's September the sixteenth, Father.'<br><br>'That's nearly a month hence.  For Heaven's sake let me forget it<br>a little longer!  I suppose we must have this ridiculous business<br>once a year to tickle the vanity of every amateur gardener in the<br>parish.  But don't let's think of it more than is absolutely<br>necessary.'<br><br>The Rector had, as Dorothy ought to have remembered, a perfect<br>abhorrence of Harvest Festivals.  He had even lost a valuable<br>parishioner--a Mr Toagis, a surly retired market gardener--through<br>his dislike, as he said, of seeing his church dressed up to imitate<br>a coster's stall.  Mr Toagis, anima naturaliter Nonconformistica,<br>had been kept 'Church' solely by the privilege, at Harvest Festival<br>time, of decorating the side altar with a sort of Stonehenge<br>composed of gigantic vegetable marrows.  The previous summer he had<br>succeeded in growing a perfect leviathan of a pumpkin, a fiery red<br>thing so enormous that it took two men to lift it.  This monstrous<br>object had been placed in the chancel, where it dwarfed the altar<br>and took all the colour out of the east window.  In no matter what<br>part of the church you were standing, the pumpkin, as the saying<br>goes, hit you in the eye.  Mr Toagis was in raptures.  He hung<br>about the church at all hours, unable to tear himself away from his<br>adored pumpkin, and even bringing relays of friends in to admire<br>it.  From the expression of his face you would have thought that he<br>was quoting Wordsworth on Westminster Bridge:<br><br><br>Earth has not any thing to show more fair:<br>Dull would he be of soul who could pass by<br>A sight so touching in its majesty!<br><br><br>Dorothy even had hopes, after this, of getting him to come to Holy<br>Communion.  But when the Rector saw the pumpkin he was seriously<br>angry, and ordered 'that revolting thing' to be removed at once.<br>Mr Toagis had instantly 'gone chapel', and he and his heirs were<br>lost to the Church for ever.<br><br>Dorothy decided to make one final attempt at conversation.<br><br>'We're getting on with the costumes for Charles I,' she said.  (The<br>Church School children were rehearsing a play entitled Charles I in<br>aid of the organ fund.)  'But I do wish we'd chosen something a bit<br>easier.  The armour is a dreadful job to make, and I'm afraid the<br>jackboots are going to be worse.  I think next time we must really<br>have a Roman or Greek play.  Something where they only have to wear<br>togas.'<br><br>This elicited only another muted grunt from the Rector.  School<br>plays, pageants, bazaars, jumble sales, and concerts in aid of were<br>not quite so bad in his eyes as Harvest Festivals, but he did not<br>pretend to be interested in them.  They were necessary evils, he<br>used to say.  At this moment Ellen, the maidservant, pushed open<br>the door and came gauchely into the room with one large, scaly hand<br>holding her sacking apron against her belly.  She was a tall,<br>round-shouldered girl with mouse-coloured hair, a plaintive voice,<br>and a bad complexion, and she suffered chronically from eczema.<br>Her eyes flitted apprehensively towards the Rector, but she<br>addressed herself to Dorothy, for she was too much afraid of the<br>Rector to speak to him directly.<br><br>'Please, Miss--' she began.<br><br>'Yes, Ellen?'<br><br>'Please, Miss,' went on Ellen plaintively, 'Mr Porter's in the<br>kitchen, and he says, please could the Rector come round and<br>baptize Mrs Porter's baby?  Because they don't think as it's going<br>to live the day out, and it ain't been baptized yet, Miss.'<br><br>Dorothy stood up.  'Sit down,' said the Rector promptly, with his<br>mouth full.<br><br>'What do they think is the matter with the baby?' said Dorothy.<br><br>'Well, Miss, it's turning quite black.  And it's had diarrhoea<br>something cruel.'<br><br>The Rector emptied his mouth with an effort.  'Must I have these<br>disgusting details while I am eating my breakfast?' he exclaimed.<br>He turned on Ellen:  'Send Porter about his business and tell him<br>I'll be round at his house at twelve o'clock.  I really cannot<br>think why it is that the lower classes always seem to choose<br>mealtimes to come pestering one,' he added, casting another<br>irritated glance at Dorothy as she sat down.<br><br>Mr Porter was a labouring man--a bricklayer, to be exact.  The<br>Rector's views on baptism were entirely sound.  If it had been<br>urgently necessary he would have walked twenty miles through snow<br>to baptize a dying baby.  But he did not like to see Dorothy<br>proposing to leave the breakfast table at the call of a common<br>bricklayer.<br><br>There was no further conversation during breakfast.  Dorothy's<br>heart was sinking lower and lower.  The demand for money had got to<br>be made, and yet it was perfectly obvious that it was foredoomed to<br>failure.  His breakfast finished, the Rector got up from the table<br>and began to fill his pipe from the tobacco-jar on the mantelpiece.<br>Dorothy uttered a short prayer for courage, and then pinched<br>herself.  Go on, Dorothy!  Out with it!  No funking, please!  With<br>an effort she mastered her voice and said:<br><br>'Father--'<br><br>'What is it?' said the Rector, pausing with the match in his hand.<br><br>'Father, I've something I want to ask you.  Something important.'<br><br>The expression of the Rector's face changed.  He had divined<br>instantly what she was going to say; and, curiously enough, he now<br>looked less irritable than before.  A stony calm had settled upon<br>his face.  He looked like a rather exceptionally aloof and<br>unhelpful sphinx.<br><br>'Now, my dear Dorothy, I know very well what you are going to say.<br>I suppose you are going to ask me for money again.  Is that it?'<br><br>'Yes, Father.  Because--'<br><br>'Well, I may as well save you the trouble.  I have no money at all--<br>absolutely no money at all until next quarter.  You have had your<br>allowance, and I can't give you a halfpenny more.  It's quite<br>useless to come worrying me now.'<br><br>'But, Father--'<br><br>Dorothy's heart sank yet lower.  What was worst of all when she<br>came to him for money was the terrible, unhelpful calmness of his<br>attitude.  He was never so unmoved as when you were reminding him<br>that he was up to his eyes in debt.  Apparently he could not<br>understand that tradesmen occasionally want to be paid, and that no<br>house can be kept going without an adequate supply of money.  He<br>allowed Dorothy eighteen pounds a month for all the household<br>expenses, including Ellen's wages, and at the same time he was<br>'dainty' about his food and instantly detected any falling off in<br>its quality.  The result was, of course, that the household was<br>perennially in debt.  But the Rector paid not the smallest<br>attention to his debts--indeed, he was hardly even aware of them.<br>When he lost money over an investment, he was deeply agitated; but<br>as for a debt to a mere tradesman--well, it was the kind of thing<br>that he simply could not bother his head about.<br><br>A peaceful plume of smoke floated upwards from the Rector's pipe.<br>He was gazing with a meditative eye at the steel engraving of<br>Charles I and had probably forgotten already about Dorothy's demand<br>for money.  Seeing him so unconcerned, a pang of desperation went<br>through Dorothy, and her courage came back to her.  She said more<br>sharply than before:<br><br>'Father, please listen to me!  I MUST have some money soon!  I<br>simply MUST!  We can't go on as we're doing.  We owe money to<br>nearly every tradesman in the town.  It's got so that some mornings<br>I can hardly bear to go down the street and think of all the bills<br>that are owing.  Do you know that we owe Cargill nearly twenty-two<br>pounds?'<br><br>'What of it?' said the Rector between puffs of smoke.<br><br>'But the bill's been mounting up for over seven months!  He's sent<br>it in over and over again.  We MUST pay it!  It's so unfair to him<br>to keep him waiting for his money like that!'<br><br>'Nonsense, my dear child!  These people expect to be kept waiting<br>for their money.  They like it.  It brings them more in the end.<br>Goodness knows how much I owe to Catkin & Palm--I should hardly<br>care to inquire.  They are dunning me by every post.  But you don't<br>hear ME complaining, do you?'<br><br>'But, Father, I can't look at it as you do, I can't!  It's so<br>dreadful to be always in debt!  Even if it isn't actually wrong,<br>it's so HATEFUL.  It makes me so ashamed!  When I go into Cargill's<br>shop to order the joint, he speaks to me so shortly and makes me<br>wait after the other customers, all because our bill's mounting up<br>the whole time.  And yet I daren't stop ordering from him.  I<br>believe he'd run us in if I did.'<br><br>The Rector frowned.  'What!  Do you mean to say the fellow has been<br>impertinent to you?'<br><br>'I didn't say he'd been impertinent, Father.  But you can't blame<br>him if he's angry when his bill's not paid.'<br><br>'I most certainly can blame him!  It is simply abominable how these<br>people take it upon themselves to behave nowadays--abominable!  But<br>there you are, you see.  That is the kind of thing that we are<br>exposed to in this delightful century.  That is democracy--<br>PROGRESS, as they are pleased to call it.  Don't order from the<br>fellow again.  Tell him at once that you are taking your account<br>elsewhere.  That's the only way to treat these people.'<br><br>'But, Father, that doesn't settle anything.  Really and truly,<br>don't you think we ought to pay him?  Surely we can get hold of the<br>money somehow?  Couldn't you sell out some shares, or something?'<br><br>'My dear child, don't talk to me about selling out shares!  I have<br>just had the most disagreeable news from my broker.  He tells me<br>that my Sumatra Tin shares have dropped from seven and fourpence to<br>six and a penny.  It means a loss of nearly sixty pounds.  I am<br>telling him to sell out at once before they drop any further.'<br><br>'Then if you sell out you'll have some ready money, won't you?<br>Don't you think it would be better to get out of debt once and for<br>all?'<br><br>'Nonsense, nonsense,' said the Rector more calmly, putting his pipe<br>back in his mouth.  'You know nothing whatever about these matters.<br>I shall have to reinvest at once in something more hopeful--it's<br>the only way of getting my money back.'<br><br>With one thumb in the belt of his cassock he frowned abstractedly<br>at the steel engraving.  His broker had advised United Celanese.<br>Here--in Sumatra Tin, United Celanese, and numberless other remote<br>and dimly imagined companies--was the central cause of the Rector's<br>money troubles.  He was an inveterate gambler.  Not, of course,<br>that he thought of it as gambling; it was merely a lifelong search<br>for a 'good investment'.  On coming of age he had inherited four<br>thousand pounds, which had gradually dwindled, thanks to his<br>'investments', to about twelve hundred.  What was worse, every year<br>he managed to scrape together, out of his miserable income, another<br>fifty pounds which vanished by the same road.  It is a curious fact<br>that the lure of a 'good investment' seems to haunt clergymen more<br>persistently than any other class of man.  Perhaps it is the modern<br>equivalent of the demons in female shape who used to haunt the<br>anchorites of the Dark Ages.<br><br>'I shall buy five hundred United Celanese,' said the Rector finally.<br><br>Dorothy began to give up hope.  Her father was now thinking of his<br>'investments' (she new nothing whatever about these 'investments',<br>except that they went wrong with phenomenal regularity), and in<br>another moment the question of the shop-debts would have slipped<br>entirely out of his mind.  She made a final effort.<br><br>'Father, let's get this settled, please.  Do you think you'll be<br>able to let me have some extra money fairly soon?  Not this moment,<br>perhaps--but in the next month or two?'<br><br>'No, my dear, I don't.  About Christmas time, possibly--it's very<br>unlikely even then.  But for the present, certainly not.  I haven't<br>a halfpenny I can spare.'<br><br>'But, Father, it's so horrible to feel we can't pay our debts!  It<br>disgraces us so!  Last time Mr Welwyn-Foster was here' (Mr Welwyn-<br>Foster was the Rural Dean) 'Mrs Welwyn-Foster was going all round<br>the town asking everyone the most personal questions about us--<br>asking how we spent our time, and how much money we had, and how<br>many tons of coal we used in a year, and everything.  She's always<br>trying to pry into our affairs.  Suppose she found out that we were<br>badly in debt!'<br><br>'Surely it is our own business?  I fail entirely to see what it has<br>to do with Mrs Welwyn-Foster or anyone else.'<br><br>'But she'd repeat it all over the place--and she'd exaggerate it<br>too!  You know what Mrs Welwyn-Foster is.  In every parish she goes<br>to she tries to find out something disgraceful about the clergyman,<br>and then she repeats every word of it to the Bishop.  I don't want<br>to be uncharitable about her, but really she--'<br><br>Realizing that she DID want to be uncharitable, Dorothy was silent.<br><br>'She is a detestable woman,' said the Rector evenly.  'What of it?<br>Who ever heard of a Rural Dean's wife who wasn't detestable?'<br><br>'But, Father, I don't seem to be able to get you to see how serious<br>things are!  We've simply nothing to live on for the next month.  I<br>don't even know where the meat's coming from for today's dinner.'<br><br>'Luncheon, Dorothy, luncheon!' said the Rector with a touch of<br>irritation.  'I do wish you would drop that abominable lower-class<br>habit of calling the midday meal DINNER!'<br><br>'For luncheon, then.  Where are we to get the meat from?  I daren't<br>ask Cargill for another joint.'<br><br>'Go to the other butcher--what's his name?  Salter--and take no<br>notice of Cargill.  He knows he'll be paid sooner or later.  Good<br>gracious, I don't know what all this fuss is about!  Doesn't<br>everyone owe money to his tradesmen?  I distinctly remember'--the<br>Rector straightened his shoulders a little, and, putting his pipe<br>back into his mouth, looked into the distance; his voice became<br>reminiscent and perceptibly more agreeable--'I distinctly remember<br>that when I was up at Oxford, my father had still not paid some of<br>his own Oxford bills of thirty years earlier.  Tom' (Tom was the<br>Rector's cousin, the Baronet) 'owed seven thousand before he came<br>into his money.  He told me so himself.'<br><br>At that, Dorothy's last hope vanished.  When her father began to<br>talk about his cousin Tom, and about things that had happened 'when<br>I was up at Oxford', there was nothing more to be done with him.<br>It meant that he had slipped into an imaginary golden past in which<br>such vulgar things as butchers' bills simply did not exist.  There<br>were long periods together when he seemed actually to forget that<br>he was only a poverty-stricken country Rector--that he was not a<br>young man of family with estates and reversions at his back.  The<br>aristocratic, the expensive attitude was the one that in all<br>circumstances came the most naturally to him.  And of course while<br>he lived, not uncomfortably, in the world of his imagination, it<br>was Dorothy who had to fight the tradesmen and make a leg of mutton<br>last from Sunday to Wednesday.  But she knew the complete<br>uselessness of arguing with him any longer.  It would only end in<br>making him angry.  She got up from the table and began to pile the<br>breakfast things on to the tray.<br><br>'You're absolutely certain you can't let me have any money,<br>Father?' she said for the last time, at the door; with the tray in<br>her arms.<br><br>The Rector, gazing into the middle distance, amid comfortable<br>wreaths of smoke, did not hear her.  He was thinking, perhaps, of<br>his golden Oxford days.  Dorothy went out of the room distressed<br>almost to the point of tears.  The miserable question of the debts<br>was once more shelved, as it had been shelved a thousand times<br>before, with no prospect of final solution.<br><br><br><br>3<br><br><br>On her elderly bicycle with the basketwork carrier on the handle-<br>bars, Dorothy free-wheeled down the hill, doing mental arithmetic<br>with three pounds nineteen and fourpence--her entire stock of money<br>until next quarter-day.<br><br>She had been through the list of things that were needed in the<br>kitchen.  But indeed, was there anything that was NOT needed in the<br>kitchen?  Tea, coffee, soap, matches, candles, sugar, lentils,<br>firewood, soda, lamp oil, boot polish, margarine, baking powder--<br>there seemed to be practically nothing that they were not running<br>short of.  And at every moment some fresh item that she had<br>forgotten popped up and dismayed her.  The laundry bill, for<br>example, and the fact that the coal was running short, and the<br>question of the fish for Friday.  The Rector was 'difficult' about<br>fish.  Roughly speaking, he would only eat the more expensive<br>kinds; cod, whiting, sprats, skate, herrings, and kippers he<br>refused.<br><br>Meanwhile, she had got to settle about the meat for today's dinner--<br>luncheon.  (Dorothy was careful to obey her father and call it<br>LUNCHEON, when she remembered it.  On the other hand, you could not<br>in honesty call the evening meal anything but 'supper'; so there<br>was no such meal as 'dinner' at the Rectory.)  Better make an<br>omelette for luncheon today, Dorothy decided.  She dared not go to<br>Cargill again.  Though, of course, if they had an omelette for<br>luncheon and then scrambled eggs for supper, her father would<br>probably be sarcastic about it.  Last time they had eggs twice in<br>one day, he had inquired coldly, 'Have you started a chicken farm,<br>Dorothy?'  And perhaps tomorrow she would get two pounds of<br>sausages at the International, and that staved off the meat-<br>question for one day more.<br><br>Thirty-nine further days, with only three pounds nineteen and<br>fourpence to provide for them, loomed up in Dorothy's imagination,<br>sending through her a wave of self-pity which she checked almost<br>instantly.  Now then, Dorothy!  No snivelling, please!  It all<br>comes right somehow if you trust in God.  Matthew vi, 25.  The Lord<br>will provide.  Will He?  Dorothy removed her right hand from the<br>handle-bars and felt for the glass-headed pin, but the blasphemous<br>thought faded.  At this moment she became aware of the gloomy red<br>face of Proggett, who was hailing her respectfully but urgently<br>from the side of the road.<br><br>Dorothy stopped and got off her bicycle.<br><br>'Beg pardon, Miss,' said Proggett.  'I been wanting to speak to<br>you, Miss--PARTIC'LAR.'<br><br>Dorothy sighed inwardly.  When Proggett wanted to speak to you<br>PARTIC'LAR, you could be perfectly certain what was coming; it was<br>some piece of alarming news about the condition of the church.<br>Proggett was a pessimistic, conscientious man, and very loyal<br>churchman, after his fashion.  Too dim of intellect to have any<br>definite religious beliefs, he showed his piety by an intense<br>solicitude about the state of the church buildings.  He had decided<br>long ago that the Church of Christ meant the actual walls, roof,<br>and tower of St Athelstan's, Knype Hill, and he would poke round<br>the church at all hours of the day, gloomily noting a cracked stone<br>here, a worm-eaten beam there--and afterwards, of course, coming to<br>harass Dorothy with demands for repairs which would cost impossible<br>sums of money.<br><br>'What is it, Proggett?' said Dorothy.<br><br>'Well, Miss, it's they --'--here a peculiar, imperfect sound, not a<br>word exactly, but the ghost of a word, all but formed itself on<br>Proggett's lips.  It seemed to begin with a B.  Proggett was one of<br>those men who are for ever on the verge of swearing, but who always<br>recapture the oath as it is escaping between their teeth.  'It's<br>they BELLS, Miss,' he said, getting rid of the B sound with an<br>effort.  'They bells up in the church tower.  They're a-splintering<br>through that there belfry floor in a way as it makes you fair<br>shudder to look at 'em.  We'll have 'em down atop of us before we<br>know where we are.  I was up the belfry 'smorning, and I tell you I<br>come down faster'n I went up, when I saw how that there floor's a-<br>busting underneath 'em.'<br><br>Proggett came to complain about the condition of the bells not less<br>than once a fortnight.  It was now three years that they had been<br>lying on the floor of the belfry, because the cost of either<br>reswinging or removing them was estimated at twenty-five pounds,<br>which might as well have been twenty-five thousand for all the<br>chance there was of paying for it.  They were really almost as<br>dangerous as Proggett made out.  It was quite certain that, if not<br>this year or next year, at any rate at some time in the near<br>future, they would fall through the belfry floor into the church<br>porch.  And, as Proggett was fond of pointing out, it would<br>probably happen on a Sunday morning just as the congregation were<br>coming into church.<br><br>Dorothy sighed again.  Those wretched bells were never out of mind<br>for long; there were times when the thought of their falling even<br>got into her dreams.  There was always some trouble or other at the<br>church.  If it was not the belfry, then it was the roof or the<br>walls; or it was a broken pew which the carpenter wanted ten<br>shillings to mend; or it was seven hymn-books needed at one and<br>sixpence each, or the flue of the stove choked up--and the sweep's<br>fee was half a crown--or a smashed window-pane or the choir-boys'<br>cassocks in rags.  There was never enough money for anything.  The<br>new organ which the rector had insisted on buying five years<br>earlier--the old one, he said, reminded him of a cow with the<br>asthma--was a burden under which the Church Expenses fund had been<br>staggering ever since.<br><br>'I don't know WHAT we can do,' said Dorothy finally; 'I really<br>don't.  We've simply no money at all.  And even if we do make<br>anything out of the school-children's play, it's all got to go to<br>the organ fund.  The organ people are really getting quite nasty<br>about their bill.  Have you spoken to my father?'<br><br>'Yes, Miss.  He don't make nothing of it.  "Belfry's held up five<br>hundred years," he says; "we can trust it to hold up a few years<br>longer."'<br><br>This was quite according to precedent.  The fact that the church<br>was visibly collapsing over his head made no impression on the<br>Rector; he simply ignored it, as he ignored anything else that he<br>did not wish to be worried about.<br><br>'Well, I don't know WHAT we can do,' Dorothy repeated.  'Of course<br>there's the jumble sale coming off the week after next.  I'm<br>counting on Miss Mayfill to give us something really NICE for the<br>jumble sale.  I know she could afford to.  She's got such lots of<br>furniture and things that she never uses.  I was in her house the<br>other day, and I saw a most beautiful Lowestoft china tea service<br>which was put away in a cupboard, and she told me it hadn't been<br>used for over twenty years.  Just suppose she gave us that tea<br>service!  It would fetch pounds and pounds.  We must just pray that<br>the jumble sale will be a success, Proggett.  Pray that it'll bring<br>us five pounds at least.  I'm sure we shall get the money somehow<br>if we really and truly pray for it.'<br><br>'Yes, Miss,' said Proggett respectfully, and shifted his gaze to<br>the far distance.<br><br>At this moment a horn hooted and a vast, gleaming blue car came<br>very slowly down the road, making for the High Street.  Out of one<br>window Mr Blifil-Gordon, the Proprietor of the sugar-beet refinery,<br>was thrusting a sleek black head which went remarkably ill with his<br>suit of sandy-coloured Harris tweed.  As he passed, instead of<br>ignoring Dorothy as usual, he flashed upon her a smile so warm that<br>it was almost amorous.  With him were his eldest son Ralph--or, as<br>he and the rest of the family pronounced it, Walph--an epicene<br>youth of twenty, given to the writing of sub-Eliot vers libre<br>poems, and Lord Pockthorne's two daughters.  They were all smiling,<br>even Lord Pockthorne's daughters.  Dorothy was astonished, for it<br>was several years since any of these people had deigned to<br>recognize her <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/A_Clergyman's_Daughter/1.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
