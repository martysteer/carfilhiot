<h2>Chapter 3</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>1<br><br><br>[SCENE:  Trafalgar Square.  Dimly visible through the mist, a dozen<br>people, Dorothy among them, are grouped about one of the benches<br>near the north parapet.]<br><br>CHARLIE [singing]:  'Ail Mary, 'ail Mary, 'a-il Ma-ary--[Big Ben<br>strikes ten.]<br><br>SNOUTER [mimicking the noise]:  Ding dong, ding dong!  Shut your<br>---- noise, can't you?  Seven more hours of it on this ---- square<br>before we get the chance of a setdown and a bit of sleep!  Cripes!<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [to himself]:  Non sum qualis eram boni sub regno<br>Edwardi!  In the days of my innocence, before the Devil carried me<br>up into a high place and dropped me into the Sunday newspapers--<br>that is to say when I was Rector of Little Fawley-cum-Dewsbury. . . .<br><br>DEAFIE [singing]:  With my willy willy, WITH my willy willy--<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  Ah, dearie, as soon as I set eyes on you I knew as you<br>was a lady born and bred.  You and me've known what it is to come<br>down in the world, haven't we, dearie?  It ain't the same for us as<br>what it is for some of these others here.<br><br>CHARLIE [singing]:  'Ail Mary, 'ail Mary, 'a-il Ma-ary, full of<br>grace!<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Calls himself a bloody husband, does he?  Four pound<br>a week in Covent Garden and 'is wife doing a starry in the bloody<br>Square!  Husband!<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [to himself]:  Happy days, happy days!  My ivied church<br>under the sheltering hillside--my red-tiled Rectory slumbering<br>among Elizabethan yews!  My library, my vinery, my cook, house-<br>parlourmaid and groom-gardener!  My cash in the bank, my name in<br>Crockford!  My black suit of irreproachable cut, my collar back to<br>front, my watered silk cassock in the church precincts. . . .<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  Of course the one thing I DO thank God for, dearie, is<br>that my poor dear mother never lived to see this day.  Because if<br>she ever HAD of lived to see the day when her eldest daughter--as<br>was brought up, mind you, with no expense spared and milk straight<br>from the cow. . . .<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  HUSBAND!<br><br>GINGER:  Come on, less 'ave a drum of tea while we got the chance.<br>Last we'll get tonight--coffee shop shuts at 'ar-parse ten.<br><br>THE KIKE:  Oh Jesus!  This bloody cold's gonna kill me!  I ain't<br>got nothing on under my trousers.  Oh Je-e-e-EEZE!<br><br>CHARLIE [singing]:  'Ail Mary, 'ail Mary--<br><br>SNOUTER:  Fourpence!  Fourpence for six ---- hours on the bum!  And<br>that there nosing sod with the wooden leg queering our pitch at<br>every boozer between Aldgate and the Mile End Road.  With 'is ----<br>wooden leg and 'is war medals as 'e bought in Lambeth Cut!<br>Bastard!<br><br>DEAFIE [singing]:  With my willy willy, WITH my willy willy--<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Well, I told the bastard what I thought of 'im,<br>anyway.  'Call yourself a man?' I says.  'I've seen things like you<br>kep' in a bottle at the 'orspital,' I says. . . .<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [to himself]:  Happy days, happy days!  Roast beef and<br>bobbing villagers, and the peace of God that passeth all<br>understanding!  Sunday mornings in my oaken stall, cool flower<br>scent and frou-frou of surplices mingling in the sweet corpse-laden<br>air!  Summer evenings when the late sun slanted through my study<br>window--I pensive, boozed with tea, in fragrant wreaths of<br>Cavendish, thumbing drowsily some half-calf volume--Poetical Works<br>of William Shenstone, Esq., Percy's Reliques of Ancient English<br>Poetry, J. Lempriere, D.D., professor of immoral theology . . .<br><br>GINGER:  Come on, 'oo's for that drum of riddleme-ree?  We got the<br>milk and we got the tea.  Question is, 'oo's got any bleeding<br>sugar?<br><br>DOROTHY:  This cold, this cold!  It seems to go right through you!<br>Surely it won't be like this all night?<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Oh, cheese it!  I 'ate these snivelling tarts.<br><br>CHARLIE:  Ain't it going to be a proper perisher, too?  Look at the<br>perishing river mist creeping up that there column.  Freeze the<br>fish-hooks off of ole Nelson before morning.<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  Of course, at the time that I'm speaking of we still<br>had our little tobacco and sweetstuff business on the corner,<br>you'll understand. . . .<br><br>THE KIKE:  Oh Je-e-e-EEZE!  Lend's that overcoat of yours, Ginger.<br>I'm bloody freezing!<br><br>SNOUTER:  ---- double-crossing bastard!  P'raps I won't bash 'is<br>navel in when I get a 'old of 'im!<br><br>CHARLIE:  Fortunes o' war, boy, fortunes o' war.  Perishing Square<br>tonight--rumpsteak and kip on feathers tomorrow.  What else d'you<br>expect on perishing Thursday?<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Shove up, Daddy, shove up!  Think I want your lousy<br>old 'ed on my shoulder--me a married woman?<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [to himself]:  For preaching, chanting, and intoning I<br>was unrivalled.  My Lift up your Hearts' was renowned throughout<br>the diocese.  All styles I could do you, High Church, Low Church,<br>Broad Church and No Church.  Throaty Anglo-Cat Warblings, straight<br>from the shoulder muscular Anglican, or the adenoidal Low Church<br>whine in which still lurk the Houyhnhnm-notes of neighing chapel<br>elders. . . .<br><br>DEAFIE [singing]:  WITH my willy willy--<br><br>GINGER:  Take your 'ands off that bleeding overcoat, Kikie.  You<br>don't get no clo'es of mine while you got the chats on you.<br><br>CHARLIE [singing]:<br><br>As pants the 'art for cooling streams,<br>When 'eated in the chase--<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT [in her sleep]:  Was 'at you, Michael dear?<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  It's my belief as the sneaking bastard 'ad another<br>wife living when 'e married me.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [from the roof of his mouth, stage curate-wise,<br>reminiscently]:  If any of you know cause of just impediment<br>why these two persons should not be joined together in holy<br>matrimony . . .<br><br>THE KIKE:  A pal!  A bloody pal!  And won't lend his bloody<br>overcoat!<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  Well, now as you've mentioned it, I must admit as I<br>never WAS one to refuse a nice cup of tea.  I know that when our<br>poor dear mother was alive, pot after pot we used to . . .<br><br>NOSY WATSON [to himself, angrily]:  Sod! . . .  Gee'd into it<br>and then a stretch all round. . . .  Never even done the bloody<br>job. . . .  Sod!<br><br>DEAFIE [singing]:  WITH my willy willy--<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT [half asleep]:  DEAR Michael. . . .  He was real<br>loving, Michael was.  Tender an' true. . . .  Never looked at<br>another man since dat evenin' when I met'm outside Kronk's<br>slaughter-house an' he gimme de two pound o' sausage as he'd<br>bummed off de International Stores for his own supper. . . .<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Well, I suppose we'll get that bloody tea this time<br>tomorrow.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [chanting, reminiscently]:  By the waters of Babylon we<br>sat down and wept, when we remembered thee, O Zion! . . .<br><br>DOROTHY:  Oh, this cold, this cold!<br><br>SNOUTER:  Well, I don't do no more ---- starries this side of<br>Christmas.  I'll 'ave my kip tomorrow if I 'ave to cut it out of<br>their bowels.<br><br>NOSY WATSON:  Detective, is he?  Smith of the Flying Squad!  Flying<br>Judas more likely!  All they can bloody do--copping the old<br>offenders what no beak won't give a fair chance.<br><br>GINGER:  Well, I'm off for the fiddlede-dee.  'Oo's got a couple of<br>clods for the water?<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT [waking]:  Oh dear, oh dear!  If my back ain't fair<br>broke!  Oh holy Jesus, if dis bench don't catch you across de<br>kidneys!  An' dere was me dreamin' I was warm in kip wid a nice cup<br>a' tea an' two o' buttered toast waitin' by me bedside.  Well, dere<br>goes me last wink o' sleep till I gets into Lambeth public lib'ry<br>tomorrow.<br><br>DADDY [his head emerging from within his overcoat like a tortoise's<br>from within its shell]:  Wassat you said, boy?  Paying money for<br>water!  How long've you bin on the road, you ignorant young scut?<br>Money for bloody water?  Bum it, boy, bum it!  Don't buy what you<br>can bum and don't bum what you can steal.  That's my word--fifty<br>year on the road, man and boy.  [Retires within his coat.]<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [chanting]:  O all ye works of the Lord--<br><br>DEAFIE [singing]:  WITH my willy willy--<br><br>CHARLIE:  'Oo was it copped you, Nosy?<br><br>THE KIKE:  Oh Je-e-e-EEZE!<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Shove up, shove up!  Seems to me some folks think<br>they've took a mortgage on this bloody seat.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [chanting]:  O all ye works of the Lord, curse ye the<br>Lord, curse Him and vilify Him for ever!<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  What I always says is, it's always us poor bloody<br>Catholics dat's down in de bloody dumps.<br><br>NOSY WATSON:  Smithy.  Flying Squad--flying sod!  Give us the plans<br>of the house and everything, and then had a van full of coppers<br>waiting and nipped the lot of us.  I wrote it up in the Black<br>Maria:<br><br>'Detective Smith knows how to gee;<br>Tell him he's a ---- from me.'<br><br>SNOUTER:  'Ere, what about our ---- tea?  Go on, Kikie, you're a<br>young 'un; shut that ---- noise and take the drums.  Don't you pay<br>nothing.  Worm it out of the old tart.  Snivel.  Do the doleful.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [chanting]:  O all ye children of men, curse ye the<br>Lord, curse Him and vilify Him for ever!<br><br>CHARLIE:  What, is Smithy crooked too?<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  I tell you what, girls, I tell you what gets ME down,<br>and that's to think of my bloody husband snoring under four<br>blankets and me freezing in this bloody Square.  That's what _I_<br>can't stomach.  The unnatural sod!<br><br>GINGER [singing]:  THERE they go--IN their joy--Don't take that<br>there drum with the cold sausage in it, Kikie.<br><br>NOSY WATSON:  Crooked?  CROOKED?  Why, a corkscrew 'ud look like a<br>bloody bradawl beside of him!  There isn't one of them double ----<br>sons of whores in the Flying Squad but 'ud sell his grandmother to<br>the knackers for two pound ten and then sit on her gravestone<br>eating potato crisps.  The geeing, narking toe rag!<br><br>CHARLIE:  Perishing tough.  'Ow many convictions you got?<br><br>GINGER [singing]:<br><br>THERE they go--IN their joy--<br>'APpy girl--LUcky boy--<br><br>NOSY WATSON:  Fourteen.  You don't stand no chance with that lot<br>against you.<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  What, don't he keep you, then?<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  No, I'm married to this one, sod 'im!<br><br>CHARLIE:  I got perishing nine myself.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [chanting]:  O Ananias, Azarias and Misael, curse ye<br>the Lord, curse Him and vilify Him for ever!<br><br>GINGER [singing]:<br><br>THERE they go--IN their joy--<br>'APpy girl--LUcky boy--<br>But 'ere am _I-I-I_--<br>Broken--'A-A-AARted!<br><br>God, I ain't 'ad a dig in the grave for three days.  'Ow long since<br>you washed your face, Snouter?<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Oh dear, oh dear!  If dat boy don't come soon wid<br>de tea me insides'll dry up like a bloody kippered herring.<br><br>CHARLIE:  YOU can't sing, none of you.  Ought to 'ear Snouter and<br>me 'long towards Christmas time when we pipe up 'Good King<br>Wenceslas' outside the boozers.  'Ymns, too.  Blokes in the bar<br>weep their perishing eyes out to 'ear us.  'Member when we tapped<br>twice at the same 'ouse by mistake, Snouter?  Old tart fair tore<br>the innards out of us.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [marching up and down behind an imaginary drum and<br>singing]:<br><br>All things vile and damnable,<br>All creatures great and small--<br><br>[Big Ben strikes half past ten.]<br><br>SNOUTER [mimicking the clock]:  Ding dong, ding dong!  Six and a<br>---- half hours of it!  Cripes!<br><br>GINGER:  Kikie and me knocked off four of them safety-razor blades<br>in Woolworth's 's afternoon.  I'll 'ave a dig in the bleeding<br>fountains tomorrow if I can bum a bit of soap.<br><br>DEAFIE:  When I was a stooard in the P. & O., we used to meet them<br>black Indians two days out at sea, in them there great canoes as<br>they call catamarans, catching sea-turtles the size of dinner<br>tables.<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  Did yoo used to be a clergyman, then, sir?<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [halting]:  After the order of Melchizedec.  There is<br>no question of 'used to be', Madam.  Once a priest always a priest.<br>Hoc est corpus hocus-pocus.

'Ere<br>comes Kikie.  Now for the consultation-free!<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Not before it's bloody needed.<br><br>CHARLIE:  'Ow come they give you the sack, mate?  Usual story?<br>Choirgirls in the family way?<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  You've took your time, ain't you, young man?  But<br>come on, let's have a sup of it before me tongue falls out o' me<br>bloody mouth.<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Shove up, Daddy!  You're sitting on my packet of<br>bloody sugar.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS:  Girls is a euphemism.  Only the usual flannel-<br>bloomered hunters of the unmarried clergy.  Church hens--altar-<br>dressers and brass-polishers--spinsters growing bony and desperate.<br>There is a demon that enters into them at thirty-five.<br><br>THE KIKE:  The old bitch wouldn't give me the hot water.

A nice cup of tea do seem to warm you<br>up, don't it, now?  Not but what I don't feel it a bit different,<br>as you might say, not having no nice clean table-cloth like I've<br>been accustomed to, and the beautiful china tea service as our<br>mother used to have; and always, of course, the very best tea as<br>money could buy--real Pekoe Points at two and nine a pound. . . .<br><br>GINGER [singing]:<br><br>THERE they go--IN their joy--<br>'APPY girl--LUCKY boy--<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [singing, to the tune of 'Deutschland, Deutschland uber<br>alles']:  Keep the aspidistra flying--<br><br>CHARLIE:  'Ow long you two kids been in Smoke?<br><br>SNOUTER:  I'm going to give them boozers such a doing tomorrow as<br>they won't know if theyr'e on their 'eads or their ---- 'eels.<br>I'll 'ave my 'alf dollar if I 'ave to 'old them upside down and<br>---- shake 'em.<br><br>GINGER:  Three days.

Woke up<br>in the morning and found I was lying on a bleeding gravestone.<br><br>THE KIKE:  She ain't half got the crabs on her, too.<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Michael an' me skippered in a pigsty once.

Bum a few pears if<br>we get there early enough.<br><br>CHARLIE:  I've 'ad my perishing bellyful of Dartmoor, b'lieve me.<br>Forty on us went through 'ell for getting off with the ole women<br>down on the allotments.  Ole trots seventy years old they was--<br>spud-grabbers.  Didn't we cop it just!  Bread and water, chained to<br>the wall--perishing near murdered us.<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  No fear!

One<br>black eye in a week's enough for me, thank you.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [chanting, reminiscently]:  As for our harps, we hanged<br>them up, upon the willow trees of Babylon! . . .<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Hold up, kiddie!  Stamp your feet an' get de blood<br>back into 'm.  I'll take y'a walk up to Paul's in a coupla minutes.<br><br>DEAFIE [singing]:  WITH my willy willy--<br><br>[Big Ben strikes eleven.]<br><br>SNOUTER:  Six more--hours!  Cripes!<br><br>[An hour passes.  Big Ben stops striking.  The mist thins and the<br>cold increases.  A grubby-faced moon is seen sneaking among the<br>clouds of the southern sky.  A dozen hardened old men remain on the<br>benches, and still contrive to sleep, doubled up and hidden in<br>their greatcoats.  Occasionally they groan in their sleep.  The<br>others set out in all directions, intending to walk all night and<br>so keep their blood flowing, but nearly all of them have drifted<br>back to the Square by midnight.  A new policeman comes on duty.<br>He strolls through the Square at intervals of half an hour,<br>scrutinizing the faces of the sleepers but letting them alone when<br>he has made sure that they are only asleep and not dead.  Round<br>each bench revolves a knot of people who take it in turns to sit<br>down and are driven to their feet by the cold after a few minutes.<br>Ginger and Charlie fill two drums at the fountains and set out in<br>the desperate hope of boiling some tea over the navvies' clinker<br>fire in Chandos Street; but a policeman is warming himself at the<br>fire, and orders them away.  The Kike suddenly vanishes, probably<br>to beg a bed at the M.A.B.  Towards one o'clock a rumour goes round<br>that a lady is distributing hot coffee, ham sandwiches, and packets<br>of cigarettes under Charing Cross Bridge; there is a rush to the<br>spot, but the rumour turns out to be unfounded.  As the Square<br>fills again the ceaseless changing of places upon the benches<br>quickens until it is a game of musical chairs.  Sitting down, with<br>one's hands under one's armpits, it is possible to get into a kind<br>of sleep, or doze, for two or three minutes on end.  In this state,<br>enormous ages seem to pass.  One sinks into a complex, troubling<br>dreams which leave one conscious of one's surroundings and of the<br>bitter cold.  The night is growing clearer and colder every minute.<br>There is a chorus of varying sound--groans, curses, bursts of<br>laughter, and singing, and through them all the uncontrollable<br>chattering of teeth.]<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [chanting]:  I am poured out like water, and all my<br>bones are out of joint! . . .<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Ellen an' me bin wanderin' round de City dis two<br>hours.

But every<br>man to his taste.  [Chanting]  'My strength is dried like a<br>potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my gums!' . . .<br><br>CHARLIE:  Say, what you think?  Nosy and me done a smash jest now.<br>Nosy sees a tobacconist's show-case full of them fancy boxes of<br>Gold Flake, and 'e says, 'By cripes I'm going to 'ave some of them<br>fags if they give me a perishing stretch for it!' 'e says.  So 'e<br>wraps 'is scarf round 'is 'and, and we waits till there's a<br>perishing great van passing as'll drown the noise, and then Nosy<br>lets fly--biff!  We nipped a dozen packets of fags, and then I bet<br>you didn't see our a--s for dust.  And when we gets round the<br>corner and opens them, there wasn't no perishing fags inside!<br>Perishing dummy boxes.  I 'ad to laugh.<br><br>DOROTHY:  My knees are giving way.  I can't stand up much longer.<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Oh, the sod, the sod!  To turn a woman out of doors<br>on a night like bloody this!  You wait'll I get 'im drunk o'<br>Saturday night and 'e can't 'it back.  I'll mash 'im to bloody shin<br>of beef, I will.  'E'll look like two pennorth of pieces after I've<br>swiped 'im with the bloody flat-iron.<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Here, make room'n let de kid sit down.  Press up<br>agen ole Daddy, dear.  Put his arm round you.  He's chatty, but<br>he'll keep you warm.<br><br>GINGER [double marking time]:  Stamp your feet on the ground--only<br>bleeding thing to do.  Strike up a song, someone, and less all<br>stamp our bleeding feet in time to it.<br><br>DADDY [waking and emerging]:  Wassat?  [Still half asleep, he lets<br>his head fall back, with mouth open and Adam's apple protruding<br>from his withered throat like the blade of a tomahawk.]<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  There's women what if they'd stood what I'VE stood,<br>they'd ave put spirits of salts in 'is cup of bloody tea.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [beating an imaginary drum and singing]:  Onward,<br>heathen so-oldiers--<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  Well, reely now!  If any of us'd ever of thought, in<br>the dear old days when we used to sit round our own Silkstone coal<br>fire, with the kettle on the hob and a nice dish of toasted<br>crumpets from the baker's over the way. . . .<br><br>[The chattering of her teeth silences her.]<br><br>CHARLIE:  No perishing church trap now, matie.  I'll give y'a bit<br>of smut--something as we can perishing dance to.  You listen t'me.<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Don't you get talkin' about crumpets, Missis.  Me<br>bloody belly's rubbin' agen me backbone already.<br><br>[Charlie draws himself up, clears his throat, and in an enormous<br>voice roars out a song entitled 'Rollicking Bill the Sailor'.  A<br>laugh that is partly a shudder bursts from the people on the bench.<br>They sing the song through again, with increasing volume of noise,<br>stamping and clapping in time.  Those sitting down, packed elbow to<br>elbow, sway grotesquely from side to side, working their feet as<br>though stamping on the pedals of a harmonium.  Even Mrs Wayne joins<br>in after a moment, laughing in spite of herself.  They are all<br>laughing, though with chattering teeth.  Mr Tallboys marches up and<br>down behind his vast swag belly, pretending to carry a banner or<br>crozier in front of him.  The night is now quite clear, and an icy<br>wind comes shuddering at intervals through the Square.  The<br>stamping and clapping rise to a kind of frenzy as the people feel<br>the deadly cold penetrate to their bones.  Then the policeman is<br>seen wandering into the Square from the eastern end, and the<br>singing ceases abruptly.]<br><br>CHARLIE:  There!  You can't say as a bit of music don't warm you<br>up.<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  This bloody wind!  And I ain't even got any drawers<br>on, the bastard kicked me out in such a 'urry.<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Well, glory be to Jesus, 'twon't be long before dat<br>dere church in de Gray's Inn Road opens up for de winter.  Dey<br>gives you a roof over your head of a night, 't any rate.<br><br>THE POLICEMAN:  Now then, now THEN!  D'you think this is the time<br>of night to begin singing like a blooming bear garden?  I shall<br>have to send you back to your homes if you can't keep quiet.<br><br>SNOUTER [sotto voce]:  You ---- son of a ----!<br><br>GINGER:  Yes--they lets you kip on the bleeding stone floor with<br>three newspaper posters 'stead of blankets.  Might as well be in<br>the Square and 'ave done with it.  God, I wish I was in the<br>bleeding spike.<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Still, you gets a cup of Horlicks an' two slices.<br>I bin glad to kip dere often enough.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [chanting]:  I was glad when they said unto me, We will<br>go into the house of the Lord! . . .<br><br>DOROTHY [starting up]:  Oh, this cold, this cold!  I don't know<br>whether it's worse when you're sitting down or when you're standing<br>up.  Oh, how can you all stand it?  Surely you don't have to do<br>this every night of your lives?<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  You mustn't think, dearie, as there isn't SOME of us<br>wasn't brought up respectable.<br><br>CHARLIE [singing]:  Cheer up, cully, you'll soon be dead!  Brrh!<br>Perishing Jesus!  Ain't my fish-hooks blue!  [Double marks time and<br>beats his arms against his sides.]<br><br>DOROTHY:  Oh, but how can you stand it?  How can you go on like<br>this, night after night, year after year?  It's not possible that<br>people can live so!  It's so absurd that one wouldn't believe it if<br>one didn't know it was true.  It's impossible!<br><br>SNOUTER:  ---- possible if you ask me.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [stage curate-wise]:  With God, all things are possible.<br><br>[Dorothy sinks back on to the bench, her knees still being<br>unsteady.]<br><br>CHARLIE:  Well, it's jest on 'ar-parse one.  Either we got to get<br>moving, or else make a pyramid on that perishing bench.  Unless we<br>want to perishing turn up our toes.  'Oo's for a little<br>constitootional up to the Tower of London?<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  'Twon't be me dat'll walk another step tonight.  Me<br>bloody legs've given out on me.<br><br>GINGER:  What-o for the pyramid!  This is a bit too bleeding nine-<br>day-old for me.  Less scrum into that bench--beg pardon, Ma!<br><br>DADDY [sleepily]:  Wassa game?  Can't a man get a bit of kip but<br>what you must come worriting 'in and shaking of 'im?<br><br>CHARLIE:  That's the stuff!  Shove in!  Shift yourself, Daddy, and<br>make room for my little sit-me-down.  Get one atop of each other.<br>That's right.  Never mind the chats.  Jam all together like<br>pilchards in a perishing tin.<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  Here!  I didn't ask you to sit on my lap, young man!<br><br>GINGER:  Sir on mine, then, mother--'sall the same.  What-o!  First<br>bit of stuff I've 'ad my arm round since Easter.<br><br>[They pile themselves in a monstrous shapeless clot, men and women<br>clinging indiscriminately together, like a bunch of toads at<br>spawning time.  There is a writhing movement as the heap settles<br>down, and a sour stench of clothes diffuses itself.  Only Mr<br>Tallboys remains marching up and down.]<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [declaiming]:  O ye nights and days, ye light and<br>darkness, ye lightnings and clouds, curse ye the Lord!<br><br>[Deafie, someone having sat on his diaphragm, utters a strange,<br>unreproducible sound.]<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Get off my bad leg, can't you?  What you think I am?<br>Bloody drawing-room sofa?<br><br>CHARLIE:  Don't ole Daddy stink when you get up agen 'im?<br><br>GINGER:  Bleeding Bank 'oliday for the chats this'll be.<br><br>DOROTHY:  Oh, God, God!<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [halting]:  Why call on God, you puling deathbed<br>penitent?  Stick to your guns and call on the Devil as I do.<br>Hail to thee, Lucifer, Prince of the Air!  [Singing to the tune<br>of 'Holy, holy holy']:  Incubi and Succubi, falling down before<br>Thee! . . .<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Oh, shut up, you blarsphemous old sod!  'E's too<br>bloody fat to feel the cold, that's what's wrong with 'im.<br><br>CHARLIE:  Nice soft be'ind you got, Ma.  Keep an eye out for the<br>perishing flattie, Ginger.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS:  Malecidite, omnia opera!  The Black Mass!  Why not?<br>Once a priest always a priest.  Hand me a chunk of toke and I will<br>work the miracle.  Sulphur candles, Lord's Prayer backwards,<br>crucifix upside down.  [To Dorothy]  If we had a black he-goat you<br>would come in useful.<br><br>[The animal heat of the piled bodies had already made itself felt.<br>A drowsiness is descending upon everyone.]<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  You mustn't think as I'm ACCUSTOMED to sitting on a<br>gentleman's knee, you know . . .<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT [drowsily]:  It took my sacraments reg'lar till de<br>bloody priest wouldn't give me absolution along o' my Michael.  De<br>ole get, de ole getsie! . . .<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [striking an attitude]:  Per aquam sacratam quam nunc<br>spargo, signumque crucis quod nunc facio. . . .<br><br>GINGER:  'Oo's got a fill of 'ard-up?  I've smoked by last bleeding<br>fag-end.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [as at the altar]:  Dearly beloved brethren we are<br>gathered together in the sight of God for the solemnization of<br>unholy blasphemy.  He has afflicted us with dirt and cold, with<br>hunger and solitude, with the pox and the itch, with the headlouse<br>and the crablouse.  Our food is damp crusts and slimy meat-scraps<br>handed out in packets from hotel doorways.  Our pleasure is stewed<br>tea and sawdust cakes bolted in reeking cellars, bar-rinsing sand<br>spittle of common ale, the embrace of toothless hags.  Our destiny<br>is the pauper's grave, twenty-feet deep in deal coffins, the kip-<br>house of underground.  It is very meet, right and our bounden duty<br>at all times and in all places to curse Him and revile Him.<br>Therefore with Demons and Archdemons [etc., etc., etc.].<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT [drowsily]:  By holy Jesus, I'm half asleep right<br>now, only some b--'s lyin' across my legs and crushin' 'em.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS:  Amen.  Evil from us deliver, but temptation into not<br>us lead [etc., etc., etc.].<br><br>[As he reaches the first word of the prayer he tears the<br>consecrated bread across.  The blood runs out of it.  There is a<br>rolling sound, as of thunder, and the landscape changes.  Dorothy's<br>feet are very cold.  Monstrous winged shapes of Demons and<br>Archdemons are dimly visible, moving to and fro.  Something, beak<br>or claw, closes upon Dorothy's shoulder, reminding her that her<br>feet and hands are aching with cold.]<br><br>THE POLICEMAN [shaking Dorothy by the shoulder]:  Wake up, now,<br>wake up, wake up!  Haven't you got an overcoat?  You're as white as<br>death.  Don't you know better than to let yourself sprawl about in<br>the cold like that?<br><br>[Dorothy finds that she is stiff with cold.  The sky is now quite<br>clear, with gritty little stars twinkling like electric lamps<br>enormously remote.  The pyramid has unrolled itself.]<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  De poor kid, she ain't used to roughin' it de way<br>us others are.<br><br>GINGER [beating his arms]:  Brr!  Woo!  'Taters in the bleeding<br>mould!<br><br>MRS WAYNE:  She's a lady born and bred.<br><br>THE POLICEMAN:  Is that so?--See here, Miss, you best come down to<br>the M.A.B. with me.  They'll give you a bed all right.  Anyone can<br>see with half an eye as you're a cut above these others here.<br><br>MRS BENDIGO:  Thank you, constable, THANK you!  'Ear that, girls?<br>'A cut above us,' 'e says.  Nice, ain't it?  [To the policeman]<br>Proper bloody Ascot swell yourself, ain't you?<br><br>DOROTHY:  No, no!  Leave me, I'd rather stay here.<br><br>THE POLICEMAN:  Well, please yourself.  You looked real bad just<br>now.  I'll be along later and take a look at you.  [Moves off<br>doubtfully.]<br><br>CHARLIE:  Wait'll the perisher's round the corner and then pile up<br>agen.  Only perishing way we'll keep warm.<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Come on, kid.  Get underneath an' let'm warm you.<br><br>SNOUTER:  Ten minutes to ---- two.  Can't last for ever, I s'pose.<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [chanting]:  I am poured out like water, and all my<br>bones are out of joint.  My heart also in the midst of my body is<br>like unto melting wax! . . .<br><br>[Once more the people pile themselves on the bench.  But the<br>temperature is now not many degrees above freezing-point, and the<br>wind is blowing more cuttingly.  The people wriggle their wind-<br>nipped faces into the heap like sucking pigs struggling for their<br>mother's teats.  One's interludes of sleep shrink to a few seconds,<br>and one's dreams grow more monstrous, troubling, and undreamlike.<br>There are times when the nine people are talking almost normally,<br>times when they can even laugh at their situation, and times when<br>they press themselves together in a kind of frenzy, with deep<br>groans of pain.  Mr Tallboys suddenly becomes exhausted and his<br>monologue degenerates into a stream of nonsense.  He drops his vast<br>bulk on top of the others, almost suffocating them.  The heap rolls<br>apart.  Some remain on the bench, some slide to the ground and<br>collapse against the parapet or against the others' knees.  The<br>policeman enters the Square and orders those on the ground to their<br>feet.  They get up, and collapse again the moment he is gone.<br>There is no sound from the ten people save of snores that are<br>partly groans.  Their heads nod like those of joined porcelain<br>Chinamen as they fall asleep and reawake as rhythmically as the<br>ticking of a clock.  Three strikes somewhere.  A voice yells like a<br>trumpet from the eastern end of the Square:  'Boys!  Up you get!<br>The noospapers is come!']<br><br>CHARLIE [starting from his sleep]:  The perishing papers!  C'm on,<br>Ginger!  Run like Hell!<br><br>[They run, or shamble, as fast as they can to the corner of the<br>Square, where three youths are distributing surplus posters given<br>away in charity by the morning newspapers.  Charlie and Ginger come<br>back with a thick wad of posters.  The five largest men now jam<br>themselves together on the bench, Deafie and the four women sitting<br>across their knees; then, with infinite difficulty (as it has to be<br>done from the inside), they wrap themselves in a monstrous cocoon<br>of paper, several sheets thick, tucking the loose ends into their<br>necks or breasts or between their shoulders and the back of the<br>bench.  Finally nothing is uncovered save their heads and the lower<br>part of their legs.  For their heads they fashion hoods of paper.<br>The paper constantly comes loose and lets in cold shafts of wind,<br>but it is now possible to sleep for as much as five minutes<br>consecutively.  At this time--between three and five in the<br>morning--it is customary with the police not to disturb the Square<br>sleepers.  A measure of warmth steals through everyone and extends<br>even to their feet.  There is some furtive fondling of the women<br>under cover of the paper.  Dorothy is too far gone to care.<br><br>By a quarter past four the paper is all crumpled and torn to<br>nothing, and it is far too cold to remain sitting down.  The people<br>get up, swear, find their legs somewhat rested, and begin to slouch<br>to and fro in couples, frequently halting from mere lassitude.<br>Every belly is now contorted with hunger.  Ginger's tin of<br>condensed milk is torn open and the contents devoured, everyone<br>dipping their fingers into it and licking them.  Those who have no<br>money at all leave the Square for the Green Park, where they will<br>be undisturbed till seven.  Those who can command even a halfpenny<br>make for Wilkins's cafe not far from the Charing Cross Road.  It is<br>known that the cafe will not open till five o'clock; nevertheless,<br>a crowd is waiting outside the door by twenty to five.]<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Got your halfpenny, dearie?  Dey won't let more'n<br>four of us in on one cup o'tea, de stingy ole gets!<br><br>MR TALLBOYS [singing]:  The roseate hu-ues of early da-awn--<br><br>GINGER:  God, that bit of sleep we 'ad under the newspapers done me<br>some good.  [Singing]  But I'm dan-cing with tears--in my eyes--<br><br>CHARLIE:  Oh, boys, boys!  Look through that perishing window, will<br>you?  Look at the 'eat steaming down the window pane!  Look at the<br>tea-urns jest on the boil, and them great piles of 'ot toast and<br>'am sandwiches, and them there sausages sizzling in the pan!  Don't<br>it make your belly turn perishing summersaults to see 'em?<br><br>DOROTHY:  I've got a penny.  I can't get a cup of tea for that,<br>can I?<br><br>SNOUTER:  ---- lot of sausages we'll get this morning with<br>fourpence between us.  'Alf a cup of tea and a ---- doughnut more<br>likely.  There's a breakfus' for you!<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  You don't need buy a cup o' tea all to yourself.<br>I got a halfpenny an' so's Daddy, an' we'll put'm to your penny an'<br>have a cup between de t'ree of us.  He's got sores on his lip, but<br>Hell! who cares?

Dey lets you sleep wid your head on de table till seven<br>o'clock.  It's a bloody godsend to us Square Tobies.<br><br>CHARLIE [slavering like a dog]:  Sausages!  Perishing sausages!<br>Welsh rabbit!  'Ot dripping toast!  And a rump-steak two inches<br>thick with chips and a pint of Ole Burton!  Oh, perishing Jesus!<br><br>[He bounds forward, pushes his way through the crowd and rattles<br>the handle of the glass door.  The whole crowd of people, about<br>forty strong, surge forward and attempt to storm the door, which is<br>stoutly held within by Mr Wilkins, the proprietor of the cafe.  He<br>menaces them through the glass.  Some press their breasts and faces<br>against the window as though warming themselves.  With a whoop and<br>a rush Florry and four other girls, comparatively fresh from having<br>spent part of the night in bed, debouch from a neighbouring alley,<br>accompanied by a gang of youths in blue suits.  They hurl<br>themselves upon the rear of the crowd with such momentum that the<br>door is almost broken.  Mr Wilkins pulls it furiously open and<br>shoves the leaders back.  A fume of sausages, kippers, coffee, and<br>hot bread streams into the outer cold.]<br><br>YOUTHS VOICES FROM THE REAR:  Why can't he ---- open before five?<br>We're starving for our ---- tea!  Ram the ---- door in!  [etc.,<br>etc.]<br><br>MR WILKINS:  Get out!  Get out, the lot of you!

[Slams the door.]<br><br>MRS MCELLIGOT:  Oh, holy Jesus, if dis ain't de longest ten minutes<br>o' de whole bloody night!  Well, I'll give me poor ole legs a rest,<br>anyway.  [Squats on her heels coal-miner-fashion.  Many others do<br>the same.]<br><br>GINGER:  'Oo's got a 'alfpenny?

Five strikes.  Intolerable ages seem to pass.<br>Then the door is suddenly wrenched open and the people stampede in<br>to fight for the corner seats.  Almost swooning in the hot air,<br>they fling themselves down and sprawl across the tables, drinking<br>in the heat and the smell of food through all their pores.]<br><br>MR WILKINS:  Now then, all!

It was hard to see what else she could do.  Her<br>father, seemingly, had abandoned her altogether, and though she had<br>friends in London who would readily have helped her, she did not<br>feel that she could face them after what had happened, or what was<br>supposed to have happened.  And she dared not apply to organized<br>charity because it would almost certainly lead to the discovery of<br>her name, and hence, perhaps, to a fresh hullabaloo about the<br>'Rector's Daughter'.<br><br>So she stayed in London, and became one of that curious tribe, rare<br>but never quite extinct--the tribe of women who are penniless and<br>homeless, but who make such desperate efforts to hide it that they<br>very nearly succeed; women who wash their faces at drinking<br>fountains in the cold of the dawn, and carefully uncrumple their<br>clothes after sleepless nights, and carry themselves with an air<br>of reserve and decency, so that only their faces, pale beneath<br>sunburn, tell you for certain that they are destitute.  It was not<br>in her to become a hardened beggar like most of the people about<br>her.  Her first twenty-four hours on the Square she spent without<br>any food whatever, except for the cup of tea that she had had<br>overnight and a third of a cup more that she had had at Wilkins's<br>cafe in the morning.  But in the evening, made desperate by hunger<br>and the others' example, she walked up to a strange woman, mastered<br>her voice with an effort, and said:  'Please, Madam, could you give<br>me twopence?  I have had nothing to eat since yesterday.'  The<br>woman stared, but she opened her purse and gave Dorothy threepence.<br>Dorothy did not know it, but her educated accent, which had made it<br>impossible to get work as a servant, was an invaluable asset to her<br>as a beggar.<br><br>After that she found that it was really very easy to beg the daily<br>shilling or so that was needed to keep her alive.  And yet she<br>never begged--it seemed to her that actually she could not do it--<br>except when hunger was past bearing or when she had got to lay in<br>the precious penny that was the passport to Wilkins's cafe in the<br>morning.  With Nobby, on the way to the hopfields, she had begged<br>without fear or scruple.  But it had been different then; she had<br>not known what she was doing.  Now, it was only under the spur of<br>actual hunger that she could screw her courage to the point, and<br>ask for a few coppers from some woman whose face looked friendly.<br>It was always women that she begged from, of course.  She did once<br>try begging from a man--but only once.<br><br>For the rest, she grew used to the life that she was leading--used<br>to the enormous sleepless nights, the cold, the dirt, the boredom,<br>and the horrible communism of the Square.  After a day or two she<br>had ceased to feel even a flicker of surprise at her situation.<br>She had come, like everyone about her, to accept this monstrous<br>existence almost as though it were normal.  The dazed, witless<br>feeling that she had known on the way to the hopfields had come<br>back upon her more strongly than before.  It is the common effect<br>of sleeplessness and still more of exposure.  To live continuously<br>in the open air, never going under a roof for more than an hour or<br>two, blurs your perceptions like a strong light glaring in your<br>eyes or a noise drumming in your ears.  You act and plan and<br>suffer, and yet all the while it is as though everything were a<br>little out of focus, a little unreal.  The world, inner and outer,<br>grows dimmer till it reaches almost the vagueness of a dream.<br><br>Meanwhile, the police were getting to know her by sight.  On the<br>Square people are perpetually coming and going, more or less<br>unnoticed.  They arrive from nowhere with their drums and their<br>bundles, camp for a few days and nights, and then disappear as<br>mysteriously as they come.  If you stay for more than a week or<br>thereabouts, the police will mark you down as an habitual beggar,<br>and they will arrest you sooner or later.  It is impossible for<br>them to enforce the begging laws at all regularly, but from time to<br>time they make a sudden raid and capture two or three of the people<br>they have had their eye on.  And so it happened in Dorothy's case.<br><br>One evening she was 'knocked off', in company with Mrs McElligot<br>and another woman whose name she did not know.  They had been<br>careless and begged off a nasty old lady with a face like a horse,<br>who had promptly walked up to the nearest policeman and given them<br>in charge.<br><br>Dorothy did not mind very much.  Everything was dreamlike now--the<br>face of the nasty old lady, eagerly accusing them, and the walk to<br>the station with a young policeman's gentle, almost deferential<br>hand on her arm; and then the white-tiled cell, with the fatherly<br>sergeant handing her a cup of tea through the grille and telling<br>her that the magistrate wouldn't be too hard on her if she pleaded<br>guilty.  In the cell next door Mrs McElligot stormed at the<br>sergeant, called him a bloody get, and then spent half the night in<br>bewailing her fate.  But Dorothy had no feeling save vague relief<br>at being in so clean and warm a place.  She crept immediately on to<br>the plank bed that was fixed like a shelf to the wall, too tired<br>even to pull the blankets about her, and slept for ten hours<br>without stirring.  It was only on the following morning that she<br>began to grasp the reality of her situation, as the Black Maria<br>rolled briskly up to Old Street Police Court, to the tune of<br>'Adeste fideles' shouted by five drunks inside.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/A_Clergyman's_Daughter/1.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/A_Clergyman's_Daughter/3.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
