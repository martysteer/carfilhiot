<h2>Chapter 4</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br><br><br>1<br><br><br>Dorothy had wronged her father in supposing that he was willing to<br>let her starve to death in the street.  He had, as a matter of<br>fact, made efforts to get in touch with her, though in a roundabout<br>and not very helpful way.<br><br>His first emotion on learning of Dorothy's disappearance had been<br>rage pure and simple.  At about eight in the morning, when he was<br>beginning to wonder what had become of his shaving water, Ellen had<br>come into his bedroom and announced in a vaguely panic-stricken<br>tone:<br><br>'Please, Sir, Miss Dorothy ain't in the house, Sir.  I can't find<br>her nowhere!'<br><br>'What?' said the Rector.<br><br>'She ain't in the house, Sir!  And her bed don't look as if it<br>hadn't been slept in, neither.  It's my belief as she's GORN, Sir!'<br><br>'Gone!' exclaimed the Rector, partly sitting up in bed.  'What do<br>you mean--GONE?'<br><br>'Well, Sir, I believe she's run away from 'ome, Sir!'<br><br>'Run away from home!  At THIS hour of the morning?  And what about<br>my breakfast, pray?'<br><br>By the time the Rector got downstairs--unshaven, no hot water<br>having appeared--Ellen had gone down into the town to make<br>fruitless inquiries for Dorothy.  An hour passed, and she did not<br>return.  Whereupon there occurred a frightful, unprecedented thing--<br>a thing never to be forgotten this side of the grave; the Rector<br>was obliged to prepare his own breakfast--yes, actually to mess<br>about with a vulgar black kettle and rashers of Danish bacon--with<br>his own sacerdotal hands.<br><br>After that, of course, his heart was hardened against Dorothy for<br>ever.  For the rest of the day he was far too busy raging over<br>unpunctual meals to ask himself WHY she had disappeared and whether<br>any harm had befallen her.  The point was that the confounded girl<br>(he said several times 'confounded girl', and came near to saying<br>something stronger) HAD disappeared, and had upset the whole<br>household by doing so.  Next day, however, the question became more<br>urgent, because Mrs Semprill was now publishing the story of the<br>elopement far and wide.  Of course, the Rector denied it violently,<br>but in his heart he had a sneaking suspicion that it might be true.<br>It was the kind of thing, he now decided, that Dorothy WOULD do.  A<br>girl who would suddenly walk out of the house without even taking<br>thought for her father's breakfast was capable of anything.<br><br>Two days later the newspapers got hold of the story, and a nosy<br>young reporter came down to Knype Hill and began asking questions.<br>The Rector made matters worse by angrily refusing to interview the<br>reporter, so that Mrs Semprill's version was the only one that got<br>into print.  For about a week, until the papers got tired of<br>Dorothy's case and dropped her in favour of a plesiosaurus that had<br>been seen at the mouth of the Thames, the Rector enjoyed a horrible<br>notoriety.  He could hardly open a newspaper without seeing some<br>flaming headline about 'Rector's Daughter.  Further Revelations',<br>or 'Rector's Daughter.  Is she in Vienna?  Reported seen in Low-<br>class Cabaret'.  Finally there came an article in the Sunday<br>Spyhole, which began, 'Down in a Suffolk Rectory a broken old man<br>sits staring at the wall', and which was so absolutely unbearable<br>that the Rector consulted his solicitor about an action for libel.<br>However, the solicitor was against it; it might lead to a verdict,<br>he said, but it would certainly lead to further publicity.  So the<br>Rector did nothing, and his anger against Dorothy, who had brought<br>this disgrace upon him, hardened beyond possibility of forgiveness.<br><br>After this there came three letters from Dorothy, explaining what<br>had happened.  Of course the Rector never really believed that<br>Dorothy had lost her memory.  It was too thin a story altogether.<br>He believed that she either HAD eloped with Mr Warburton, or had<br>gone off on some similar escapade and had landed herself penniless<br>in Kent; at any rate--this he had settled once and for all, and no<br>argument would ever move him from it--whatever had happened to her<br>was entirely her own fault.  The first letter he wrote was not to<br>Dorothy herself but to his cousin Tom, the baronet.  For a man of<br>the Rector's upbringing it was second nature, in any serious<br>trouble, to turn to a rich relative for help.  He had not exchanged<br>a word with his cousin for the last fifteen years, since they had<br>quarrelled over a little matter of a borrowed fifty pounds; still,<br>he wrote fairly confidently, asking Sir Thomas to get in touch with<br>Dorothy if it could be done, and to find her some kind of job in<br>London.  For of course, after what had happened, there could be no<br>question of letting her come back to Knype Hill.<br><br>Shortly after this there came two despairing letters from Dorothy,<br>telling him that she was in danger of starvation and imploring him<br>to send her some money.  The Rector was disturbed.  It occurred to<br>him--it was the first time in his life that he had seriously<br>considered such a thing--that it IS possible to starve if you have<br>no money.  So, after thinking it over for the best part of a week,<br>he sold out ten pounds' worth of shares and sent a cheque for ten<br>pounds to his cousin, to be kept for Dorothy till she appeared.  At<br>the same time he sent a cold letter to Dorothy herself, telling her<br>that she had better apply to Sir Thomas Hare.  But several more<br>days passed before this letter was posted, because the Rector had<br>qualms about addressing a letter to 'Ellen Millborough'--he dimly<br>imagined that it was against the law to use false names--and, of<br>course, he had delayed far too long.  Dorothy was already in the<br>streets when the letter reached 'Mary's'.<br><br>Sir Thomas Hare was a widower, a good-hearted, chuckle-headed man<br>of about sixty-five, with an obtuse rosy face and curling<br>moustaches.  He dressed by preference in checked overcoats and<br>curly brimmed bowler hats that were at once dashingly smart and<br>four decades out of date.  At a first glance he gave the impression<br>of having carefully disguised himself as a cavalry major of the<br>'nineties, so that you could hardly look at him without thinking of<br>devilled bones with a b and s, and the tinkle of hansom bells, and<br>the Pink 'Un in its great 'Pitcher' days, and Lottie Collins and<br>'Tarara-BOOM-deay'.  But his chief characteristic was an abysmal<br>mental vagueness.  He was one of those people who say 'Don't you<br>know?' and 'What!  What!' and lose themselves in the middle of their<br>sentences.  When he was puzzled or in difficulties, his moustaches<br>seemed to bristle forward, giving him the appearance of a well-<br>meaning but exceptionally brainless prawn.<br><br>So far as his own inclinations went Sir Thomas was not in the least<br>anxious to help his cousins, for Dorothy herself he had never seen,<br>and the Rector he looked on as a cadging poor relation of the worst<br>possible type.  But the fact was that he had had just about as much<br>of this 'Rector's Daughter' business as he could stand.  The<br>accursed chance that Dorothy's surname was the same as his own had<br>made his life a misery for the past fortnight, and he foresaw<br>further and worse scandals if she were left at large any longer.<br>So, just before leaving London for the pheasant shooting, he sent<br>for his butler, who was also his confidant and intellectual guide,<br>and held a council of war.<br><br>'Look here, Blyth, dammit,' said Sir Thomas prawnishly (Blyth was<br>the butler's name), 'I suppose you've seen all this damn' stuff in<br>the newspapers, hey?  This "Rector's Daughter" stuff?  About this<br>damned niece of mine.'<br><br>Blyth was a small sharp-featured man with a voice that never rose<br>above a whisper.  It was as nearly silent as a voice can be while<br>still remaining a voice.  Only by watching his lips as well as<br>listening closely could you catch the whole of what he said.  In<br>this case his lips signalled something to the effect that Dorothy<br>was Sir Thomas's cousin, not his niece.<br><br>'What, my cousin, is she?' said Sir Thomas.  'So she is, by Jove!<br>Well, look here, Blyth, what I mean to say--it's about time we got<br>hold of the damn' girl and locked her up somewhere.  See what I<br>mean?  Get hold of her before there's any MORE trouble.  She's<br>knocking about somewhere in London, I believe.  What's the best way<br>of getting on her track?  Police?  Private detectives and all that?<br>D'you think we could manage it?'<br><br>Blyth's lips registered disapproval.  It would, he seemed to be<br>saying, be possible to trace Dorothy without calling in the police<br>and having a lot of disagreeable publicity.<br><br>'Good man!' said Sir Thomas.  'Get to it, then.  Never mind what it<br>costs.  I'd give fifty quid not to have that "Rector's Daughter"<br>business over again.  And for God's sake, Blyth,' he added<br>confidentially, 'once you've got hold of the damn' girl, don't let<br>her out of your sight.  Bring her back to the house and damn' well<br>keep her here.  See what I mean?  Keep her under lock and key till<br>I get back.  Or else God knows what she'll be up to next.'<br><br>Sir Thomas, of course, had never seen Dorothy, and it was therefore<br>excusable that he should have formed his conception of her from the<br>newspaper reports.<br><br>It took Blyth about a week to track Dorothy down.  On the morning<br>after she came out of the police-court cells (they had fined her<br>six shillings, and, in default of payment, detained her for twelve<br>hours: Mrs McElligot, as an old offender, got seven days), Blyth<br>came up to her, lifted his bowler hat a quarter of an inch from his<br>head, and inquired noiselessly whether she were not Miss Dorothy<br>Hare.  At the second attempt Dorothy understood what he was saying,<br>and admitted that she WAS Miss Dorothy Hare; whereupon Blyth<br>explained that he was sent by her cousin, who was anxious to help<br>her, and that she was to come home with him immediately.<br><br>Dorothy followed him without more words said.  It seemed queer that<br>her cousin should take this sudden interest in her, but it was no<br>queerer than the other things that had been happening lately.  They<br>took the bus to Hyde Park Corner, Blyth paying the fares, and then<br>walked to a large, expensive-looking house with shuttered windows,<br>on the borderland between Knightsbridge and Mayfair.  They went<br>down some steps, and Blyth produced a key and they went in.  So,<br>after an absence of something over six weeks, Dorothy returned to<br>respectable society, by the area door.<br><br>She spent three days in the empty house before her cousin came<br>home.  It was a queer, lonely time.  There were several servants in<br>the house, but she saw nobody except Blyth, who brought her her<br>meals and talked to her, noiselessly, with a mixture of deference<br>and disapproval.  He could not quite make up his mind whether she<br>was a young lady of family or a rescued Magdalen, and so treated<br>her as something between the two.  The house had that hushed,<br>corpselike air peculiar to houses whose master is away, so that you<br>instinctively went about on tiptoe and kept the blinds over the<br>windows.  Dorothy did not even dare to enter any of the main rooms.<br>She spent all the daytime lurking in a dusty, forlorn room at the<br>top of the house which was a sort of museum of bric-a-brac dating<br>from 1880 onwards.  Lady Hare, dead these five years, had been an<br>industrious collector of rubbish, and most of it had been stowed<br>away in this room when she died.  It was a doubtful point whether<br>the queerest object in the room was a yellowed photograph of<br>Dorothy's father, aged eighteen but with respectable side-whiskers,<br>standing self-consciously beside an 'ordinary' bicycle--this was in<br>1888; or whether it was a little sandalwood box labelled 'Piece of<br>Bread touched by Cecil Rhodes at the City and South Africa Banquet,<br>June 1897'.  The sole books in the room were some grisly school<br>prizes that had been won by Sir Thomas's children--he had three,<br>the youngest being the same age as Dorothy.<br><br>It was obvious that the servants had orders not to let her go out<br>of doors.  However, her father's cheque for ten pounds had arrived,<br>and with some difficulty she induced Blyth to get it cashed, and,<br>on the third day, went out and bought herself some clothes.  She<br>bought herself a ready-made tweed coat and skirt and a jersey to go<br>with them, a hat, and a very cheap frock of artificial printed<br>silk; also a pair of passable brown shoes, three pairs of lisle<br>stockings, a nasty, cheap little handbag, and a pair of grey cotton<br>gloves that would pass for suede at a little distance.  That came<br>to eight pounds ten, and she dared not spend more.  As for<br>underclothes, nightdresses, and handkerchiefs, they would have to<br>wait.  After all, it is the clothes that show that matter.<br><br>Sir Thomas arrived on the following day, and never really got over<br>the surprise that Dorothy's appearance gave him.  He had been<br>expecting to see some rouged and powdered siren who would plague<br>him with temptations to which alas! he was no longer capable of<br>succumbing; and this countrified, spinsterish girl upset all his<br>calculations.  Certain vague ideas that had been floating about his<br>mind, of finding her a job as a manicurist or perhaps as a private<br>secretary to a bookie, floated out of it again.  From time to time<br>Dorothy caught him studying her with a puzzled, prawnish eye,<br>obviously wondering how on earth such a girl could ever have<br>figured in an elopement.  It was very little use, of course,<br>telling him that she had NOT eloped.  She had given him her version<br>of the story, and he had accepted it with a chivalrous 'Of course,<br>m'dear, of course!' and thereafter, in every other sentence,<br>betrayed the fact that he disbelieved her.<br><br>So for a couple of days nothing definite was done.  Dorothy<br>continued her solitary life in the room upstairs, and Sir Thomas<br>went to his club for most of his meals, and in the evening there<br>were discussions of the most unutterable vagueness.  Sir Thomas was<br>genuinely anxious to find Dorothy a job, but he had great<br>difficulty in remembering what he was talking about for more than a<br>few minutes at a time.  'Well, m'dear,' he would start off, 'you'll<br>understand, of course, that I'm very keen to do what I can for you.<br>Naturally, being your uncle and all that--what?  What's that?  Not<br>your uncle?  No, I suppose I'm not, by Jove!  Cousin--that's it;<br>cousin.  Well, now, m'dear, being your cousin--now, what was I<br>saying?'  Then, when Dorothy had guided him back to the subject, he<br>would throw out some such suggestion as, 'Well, now, for instance,<br>m'dear, how would you like to be companion to an old lady?  Some<br>dear old girl, don't you know--black mittens and rheumatoid<br>arthritis.  Die and leave you ten thousand quid and care of the<br>parrot.  What, what?' which did not get them very much further.<br>Dorothy repeated a number of times that she would rather be a<br>housemaid or a parlourmaid, but Sir Thomas would not hear of it.<br>The very idea awakened in him a class-instinct which he was usually<br>too vague-minded to remember.  'What!' he would say.  'A dashed<br>skivvy?  Girl of your upbringing?  No, m'dear--no, no!  Can't do<br>THAT kind of thing, dash it!'<br><br>But in the end everything was arranged, and with surprising ease;<br>not by Sir Thomas, who was incapable of arranging anything, but by<br>his solicitor, whom he had suddenly thought of consulting.  And the<br>solicitor, without even seeing Dorothy, was able to suggest a job<br>for her.  She could, he said, almost certainly find a job as a<br>schoolmistress.  Of all jobs, that was the easiest to get.<br><br>Sir Thomas came home very pleased with this suggestion, which<br>struck him as highly suitable.  (Privately, he thought that Dorothy<br>had just the kind of face that a schoolmistress ought to have.)<br>But Dorothy was momentarily aghast when she heard of it.<br><br>'A schoolmistress!' she said.  'But I couldn't possibly!  I'm sure<br>no school would give me a job.  There isn't a single subject I can<br>teach.'<br><br>'What?  What's that?  Can't teach?  Oh, dash it!  Of course you<br>can!  Where's the difficulty?'<br><br>'But I don't know enough!  I've never taught anybody anything,<br>except cooking to the Girl Guides.  You have to be properly<br>qualified to be a teacher.'<br><br>'Oh, nonsense!  Teaching's the easiest job in the world.  Good<br>thick ruler--rap 'em over the knuckles.  They'll be glad enough<br>to get hold of a decently brought up young woman to teach the<br>youngsters their ABC.  That's the line for you, m'dear--<br>schoolmistress.  You're just cut out for it.'<br><br>And sure enough, a schoolmistress Dorothy became.  The invisible<br>solicitor had made all the arrangements in less than three days.<br>It appeared that a certain Mrs Creevy, who kept a girls' day school<br>in the suburb of Southbridge, was in need of an assistant, and was<br>quite willing to give Dorothy the job.  How it had all been settled<br>so quickly, and what kind of school it could be that would take on<br>a total stranger, and unqualified at that, in the middle of the<br>term, Dorothy could hardly imagine.  She did not know, of course,<br>that a bribe of five pounds, miscalled a premium, had changed<br>hands.<br><br>So, just ten days after her arrest for begging, Dorothy set out for<br>Ringwood House Academy, Brough Road, Southbridge, with a small<br>trunk decently full of clothes and four pounds ten in her purse--<br>for Sir Thomas had made her a present of ten pounds.  When she<br>thought of the ease with which this job had been found for her, and<br>then of the miserable struggles of three weeks ago, the contrast<br>amazed her.  It brought home to her, as never before, the<br>mysterious power of money.  In fact, it reminded her of a favourite<br>saying of Mr Warburton's, that if you took 1 Corinthians, chapter<br>thirteen, and in every verse wrote 'money' instead of 'charity',<br>the chapter had ten times as much meaning as before.<br><br><br><br>2<br><br><br>Southbridge was a repellent suburb ten or a dozen miles from<br>London.  Brough Road lay somewhere at the heart of it, amid<br>labyrinths of meanly decent streets, all so indistinguishably<br>alike, with their ranks of semi-detached houses, their privet and<br>laurel hedges and plots of ailing shrubs at the crossroads, that<br>you could lose yourself there almost as easily as in a Brazilian<br>forest.  Not only the houses themselves, but even their names were<br>the same over and over again.  Reading the names on the gates as<br>you came up Brough Road, you were conscious of being haunted by<br>some half-remembered passage of poetry; and when you paused to<br>identify it, you realized that it was the first two lines of<br>Lycidas.<br><br>Ringwood House was a dark-looking, semi-detached house of yellow<br>brick, three storeys high, and its lower windows were hidden from<br>the road by ragged and dusty laurels.  Above the laurels, on the<br>front of the house, was a board inscribed in faded gold letters:<br><br><br>RINGWOOD HOUSE ACADEMY FOR GIRLS<br><br>Ages 5 to 18<br><br>Music and Dancing Taught<br><br>Apply within for Prospectus<br><br><br>Edge to edge with this board, on the other half of the house, was<br>another board which read:<br><br><br>RUSHINGTON GRANGE HIGH SCHOOL FOR BOYS<br><br>Ages 6 to 16<br><br>Book-keeping and Commercial Arithmetic a Speciality<br><br>Apply within for Prospectus<br><br><br>The district pullulated with small private schools; there were four<br>of them in Brough Road alone.  Mrs Creevy, the Principal of<br>Ringwood House, and Mr Boulger, the Principal of Rushington Grange,<br>were in a state of warfare, though their interests in no way<br>clashed with one another.  Nobody knew what the feud was about, not<br>even Mrs Creevy or Mr Boulger themselves; it was a feud that they<br>had inherited from earlier proprietors of the two schools.  In the<br>mornings after breakfast they would stalk up and down their<br>respective back gardens, beside the very low wall that separated<br>them, pretending not to see one another and grinning with hatred.<br><br>Dorothy's heart sank at the sight of Ringwood House.  She had not<br>been expecting anything very magnificent or attractive, but she had<br>expected something a little better than this mean, gloomy house,<br>not one of whose windows was lighted, though it was after 8 o'clock<br>in the evening.  She knocked at the door, and it was opened by a<br>woman, tall and gaunt-looking in the dark hallway, whom Dorothy<br>took for a servant, but who was actually Mrs Creevy herself.<br>Without a word, except to inquire Dorothy's name, the woman led the<br>way up some dark stairs to a twilit, fireless drawing-room, where<br>she turned up a pinpoint of gas, revealing a black piano, stuffed<br>horsehair chairs, and a few yellowed, ghostly photos on the walls.<br><br>Mrs Creevy was a woman somewhere in her forties, lean, hard, and<br>angular, with abrupt decided movements that indicated a strong will<br>and probably a vicious temper.  Though she was not in the least<br>dirty or untidy there was something discoloured about her whole<br>appearance, as though she lived all her life in a bad light; and<br>the expression of her mouth, sullen and ill-shaped with the lower<br>lip turned down, recalled that of a toad.  She spoke in a sharp,<br>commanding voice, with a bad accent and occasional vulgar turns of<br>speech.  You could tell her at a glance for a person who knew<br>exactly what she wanted, and would grasp it as ruthlessly as any<br>machine; not a bully exactly--you could somehow infer from her<br>appearance that she would not take enough interest in you to want<br>to bully you--but a person who would make use of you and then throw<br>you aside with no more compunction than if you had been a worn-out<br>scrubbing-brush.<br><br>Mrs Creevy did not waste any words on greetings.  She motioned<br>Dorothy to a chair, with the air rather of commanding than of<br>inviting her to sir down, and then sat down herself, with her hands<br>clasped on her skinny forearms.<br><br>'I hope you and me are going to get on well together, Miss<br>Millborough,' she began in her penetrating, subhectoring voice.<br>(On the advice of Sir Thomas's everwise solicitor, Dorothy had<br>stuck to the name of Ellen Millborough.)  'And I hope I'm not going<br>to have the same nasty business with you as I had with my last two<br>assistants.  You say you haven't had an experience of teaching<br>before this?'<br><br>'Not in a school,' said Dorothy--there had been a tarradiddle in<br>her letter of introduction, to the effect that she had had<br>experience of 'private teaching'.<br><br>Mrs Creevy looked Dorothy over as though wondering whether to<br>induct her into the inner secrets of school-teaching, and then<br>appeared to decide against it.<br><br>'Well, we shall see,' she said.  'I must say,' she added<br>complainingly, 'it's not easy to get hold of good hardworking<br>assistants nowadays.  You give them good wages and good treatment,<br>and you get no thanks for it.  The last one I had--the one I've<br>just had to get rid of--Miss Strong, wasn't so bad so far as the<br>teaching part went; in fact, she was a B.A., and I don't know what<br>you could have better than a B.A., unless it's an M.A.  You don't<br>happen to be a B.A. or an M.A., do you, Miss Millborough?'<br><br>'No, I'm afraid not,' said Dorothy.<br><br>'Well, that's a pity.  It looks so much better on the prospectus if<br>you've got a few letters after your name.  Well!  Perhaps it<br>doesn't matter.  I don't suppose many of OUR parents'd know what<br>B.A.  stands for; and they aren't so keen on showing their<br>ignorance.  I suppose you can talk French, of course?'<br><br>'Well--I've learnt French.'<br><br>'Oh, that's all right, then.  Just so as we can put it on the<br>prospectus.  Well, now, to come back to what I was saying, Miss<br>Strong was all right as a teacher, but she didn't come up to my<br>ideas on what I call the MORAL SIDE.  We're very strong on the<br>moral side at Ringwood House.  It's what counts most with the<br>parents, you'll find.  And the one before Miss Strong, Miss Brewer--<br>well, she had what I call a weak nature.  You don't get on with<br>girls if you've got a weak nature.  The end of it all was that one<br>morning one little girl crept up to the desk with a box of matches<br>and set fire to Miss Brewer's skirt.  Of course I wasn't going to<br>keep her after that.  In fact I had her out of the house the same<br>afternoon--and I didn't give her any refs either, I can tell you!'<br><br>'You mean you expelled the girl who did it?' said Dorothy,<br>mystified.<br><br>'What?  The GIRL?  Not likely!  You don't suppose I'd go and turn<br>fees away from my door, do you?  I mean I got rid of Miss Brewer,<br>not the GIRL.  It's no good having teachers who let the girls get<br>saucy with them.  We've got twenty-one in the class just at<br>present, and you'll find they need a strong hand to keep them down.'<br><br>'You don't teach yourself?' said Dorothy.<br><br>'Oh dear, no!' said Mrs Creevy almost contemptuously.  'I've got a<br>lot too much on my hands to waste my time TEACHING.  There's the<br>house to look after, and seven of the children stay to dinner--I've<br>only a daily woman at present.  Besides, it takes me all my time<br>getting the fees out of the parents.  After all, the fees ARE what<br>matter, aren't they?'<br><br>'Yes.  I suppose so,' said Dorothy.<br><br>'Well, we'd better settle about your wages,' continued Mrs Creevy.<br>'In term time I'll give you your board and lodging and ten<br>shillings a week; in the holidays it'll just be your board and<br>lodging.  You can have the use of the copper in the kitchen for<br>your laundering, and I light the geyser for hot baths every<br>Saturday night; or at least MOST Saturday nights.  You can't have<br>the use of this room we're in now, because it's my reception-room,<br>and I don't want you to go wasting the gas in your bedroom.  But<br>you can have the use of the morning-room whenever you want it.'<br><br>'Thank you,' said Dorothy.<br><br>'Well, I should think that'll be about all.  I expect you're<br>feeling ready for bed.  You'll have had your supper long ago, of<br>course?'<br><br>This was clearly intended to mean that Dorothy was not going to get<br>any food tonight, so she answered Yes, untruthfully, and the<br>conversation was at an end.  That was always Mrs Creevy's way--she<br>never kept you talking an instant longer than was necessary.  Her<br>conversation was so very definite, so exactly to the point, that it<br>was not really conversation at all.  Rather, it was the skeleton of<br>conversation; like the dialogue in a badly written novel where<br>everyone talks a little too much in character.  But indeed, in the<br>proper sense of the word she did not TALK; she merely said, in her<br>brief shrewish way, whatever it was necessary to say, and then got<br>rid of you as promptly as possible.  She now showed Dorothy along<br>the passage to her bedroom, and lighted a gas-jet no bigger than an<br>acorn, revealing a gaunt bedroom with a narrow white-quilted bed, a<br>rickety wardrobe, one chair and a wash-hand-stand with a frigid<br>white china basin and ewer.  It was very like the bedrooms in<br>seaside lodging houses, but it lacked the one thing that gives such<br>rooms their air of homeliness and decency--the text over the bed.<br><br>'This is your room,' Mrs Creevy said; 'and I just hope you'll keep<br>it a bit tidier than what Miss Strong used to.  And don't go<br>burning the gas half the night, please, because I can tell what<br>time you turn it off by the crack under the door.'<br><br>With this parting salutation she left Dorothy to herself.  The room<br>was dismally cold; indeed, the whole house had a damp, chilly<br>feeling, as though fires were rarely lighted in it.  Dorothy got<br>into bed as quickly as possible, feeling bed to be the warmest<br>place.  On top of the wardrobe, when she was putting her clothes<br>away, she found a cardboard box containing no less than nine empty<br>whisky bottles--relics, presumably, of Miss Strong's weakness on<br>the MORAL SIDE.<br><br>At eight in the morning Dorothy went downstairs and found Mrs<br>Creevy already at breakfast in what she called the 'morning-room'.<br>This was a smallish room adjoining the kitchen, and it had started<br>life as the scullery; but Mrs Creevy had converted it into the<br>'morning-room' by the simple process of removing the sink and<br>copper into the kitchen.  The breakfast table, covered with a cloth<br>of harsh texture, was very large and forbiddingly bare.  Up at Mrs<br>Creevy's end were a tray with a very small teapot and two cups, a<br>plate on which were two leathery fried eggs, and a dish of<br>marmalade; in the middle, just within Dorothy's reach if she<br>stretched, was a plate of bread and butter; and beside her plate--<br>as though it were the only thing she could be trusted with--a cruet<br>stand with some dried-up, clotted stuff inside the bottles.<br><br>'Good morning, Miss Millborough,' said Mrs Creevy.  'It doesn't<br>matter this morning, as this is the first day, but just remember<br>another time that I want you down here in time to help me get<br>breakfast ready.'<br><br>'I'm so sorry,' said Dorothy.<br><br>'I hope you're fond of fried eggs for your breakfast?' went on Mrs<br>Creevy.<br><br>Dorothy hastened to assure her that she was very fond of fried<br>eggs.<br><br>'Well, that's a good thing, because you'll always have to have the<br>same as what I have.  So I hope you're not going to be what I call<br>DAINTY about your food.  I always think,' she added, picking up her<br>knife and fork, 'that a fried egg tastes a lot better if you cut it<br>well up before you eat it.'<br><br>She sliced the two eggs into thin strips, and then served them in<br>such a way that Dorothy received about two-thirds of an egg.  With<br>some difficulty Dorothy spun out her fraction of egg so as to make<br>half a dozen mouthfuls of it, and then, when she had taken a slice<br>of bread and butter, she could not help glancing hopefully in the<br>direction of the dish of marmalade.  But Mrs Creevy was sitting<br>with her lean left arm--not exactly ROUND the marmalade, but in a<br>protective position on its left flank, as though she suspected that<br>Dorothy was going to make an attack upon it.  Dorothy's nerve<br>failed her, and she had no marmalade that morning--nor, indeed,<br>for many mornings to come.<br><br>Mrs Creevy did not speak again during breakfast, but presently the<br>sound of feet on the gravel outside, and of squeaky voices in the<br>schoolroom, announced that the girls were beginning to arrive.<br>They came in by a side-door that was left open for them.  Mrs<br>Creevy got up from the table and banged the breakfast things<br>together on the tray.  She was one of those women who can never<br>move anything without banging it about; she was as full of thumps<br>and raps as a poltergeist.  Dorothy carried the tray into the<br>kitchen, and when she returned Mrs Creevy produced a penny notebook<br>from a drawer in the dresser and laid it open on the table.<br><br>'Just take a look at this,' she said.  'Here's a list of the girls'<br>names that I've got ready for you.  I shall want you to know the<br>whole lot of them by this evening.'  She wetted her thumb and<br>turned over three pages:  'Now, do you see these three lists here?'<br><br>'Yes,' said Dorothy.<br><br>'Well, you'll just have to learn those three lists by heart, and<br>make sure you know what girls are on which.  Because I don't want<br>you to go thinking that all the girls are to be treated alike.<br>They aren't--not by a long way, they aren't.  Different girls,<br>different treatment--that's my system.  Now, do you see this lot on<br>the first page?'<br><br>'Yes,' said Dorothy again.<br><br>'Well, the parents of that lot are what I call the good payers.<br>You know what I mean by that?  They're the ones that pay cash on<br>the nail and no jibbing at an extra half-guinea or so now and<br>again.  You're not to smack any of that lot, not on ANY account.<br>This lot over here are the MEDIUM payers.  Their parents do pay up<br>sooner or later, but you don't get the money out of them without<br>you worry them for it night and day.  You can smack that lot if<br>they get saucy, but don't go and leave a mark their parents can<br>see.  If you'll take MY advice, the best thing with children is to<br>twist their ears.  Have you ever tried that?'<br><br>'No,' said Dorothy.<br><br>'Well, I find it answers better than anything.  It doesn't leave a<br>mark, and the children can't bear it.  Now these three over here<br>are the BAD payers.  Their fathers are two terms behind already,<br>and I'm thinking of a solicitor's letter.  I don't care WHAT you do<br>to that lot--well, short of a police-court case, naturally.  Now,<br>shall I take you in and start you with the girls?  You'd better<br>bring that book along with you, and just keep your eye on it all<br>the time so as there'll be no mistakes.'<br><br>They went into the schoolroom.  It was a largish room, with grey-<br>papered walls that were made yet greyer by the dullness of the<br>light, for the heavy laurel bushes outside choked the windows, and<br>no direct ray of the sun ever penetrated into the room.  There was<br>a teacher's desk by the empty fireplace, and there were a dozen<br>small double desks, a light blackboard, and, on the mantelpiece, a<br>black clock that looked like a miniature mausoleum; but there were<br>no maps, no pictures, nor even, as far as Dorothy could see, any<br>books.  The sole objects in the room that could be called<br>ornamental were two sheets of black paper pinned to the walls, with<br>writing on them in chalk in beautiful copperplate.  On one was<br>'Speech is Silver.  Silence is Golden', and on the other<br>'Punctuality is the Politeness of Princes'.<br><br>The girls, twenty-one of them, were already sitting at their desks.<br>They had grown very silent when they heard footsteps approaching,<br>and as Mrs Creevy came in they seemed to shrink down in their places<br>like partridge chicks when a hawk is soaring.  For the most part<br>they were dull-looking, lethargic children with bad complexions, and<br>adenoids seemed to be remarkably common among them.  The eldest of<br>them might have been fifteen years old, the youngest was hardly more<br>than a baby.  The school had no uniform, and one or two of the<br>children were verging on raggedness.<br><br>'Stand up, girls,' said Mrs Creevy as she reached the teacher's<br>desk.  'We'll start off with the morning prayer.'<br><br>The girls stood up, clasped their hands in front of them, and shut<br>their eyes.  They repeated the prayer in unison, in weak piping<br>voices, Mrs Creevy leading them, her sharp eyes darting over them<br>all the while to see that they were attending.<br><br>'Almighty and everlasting Father,' they piped, 'we beseech Thee<br>that our studies this day may be graced by Thy divine guidance.<br>Make us to conduct ourselves quietly and obediently; look down upon<br>our school and make it to prosper, so that it may grow in numbers<br>and be a good example to the neighbourhood and not a disgrace like<br>some schools of which Thou knowest, O Lord.  Make us, we beseech<br>Thee, O Lord, industrious, punctual, and ladylike, and worthy in<br>all possible respects to walk in Thy ways: for Jesus Christ's sake,<br>our Lord, Amen.'<br><br>This prayer was of Mrs Creevy's own composition.  When they had<br>finished it, the girls repeated the Lord's Prayer, and then sat<br>down.<br><br>'Now, girls,' said Mrs Creevy, 'this is your new teacher, Miss<br>Millborough.  As you know, Miss Strong had to leave us all of a<br>sudden after she was taken so bad in the middle of the arithmetic<br>lesson; and I can tell you I've had a hard week of it looking for a<br>new teacher.  I had seventy-three applications before I took on<br>Miss Millborough, and I had to refuse them all because their<br>qualifications weren't high enough.  Just you remember and tell<br>your parents that, all of you--seventy-three applications!  Well,<br>Miss Millborough is going to take you in Latin, French, history,<br>geography, mathematics, English literature and composition,<br>spelling, grammar, handwriting, and freehand drawing; and Mr Booth<br>will take you in chemistry as usual on Thursday afternoons.  Now,<br>what's the first lesson on your time-table this morning?'<br><br>'History, Ma'am,' piped one or two voices.<br><br>'Very well.  I expect Miss Millborough'll start off by asking you a<br>few questions about the history you've been learning.  So just you<br>do your best, all of you, and let her see that all the trouble<br>we've taken over you hasn't been wasted.  You'll find they can be<br>quite a sharp lot of girls when they try, Miss Millborough.'<br><br>'I'm sure they are,' said Dorothy.<br><br>'Well, I'll be leaving you, then.  And just you behave yourselves,<br>girls!  Don't you get trying it on with Miss Millborough like you<br>did with Miss Brewer, because I warn you she won't stand it.  If I<br>hear any noise coming from this room, there'll be trouble for<br>somebody.'<br><br>She gave a glance round which included Dorothy and indeed suggested<br>that Dorothy would probably be the 'somebody' referred to, and<br>departed.<br><br>Dorothy faced the class.  She was not afraid of them--she was too<br>used to dealing with children ever to be afraid of them--but she<br>did feel a momentary qualm.  The sense of being an impostor (what<br>teacher has not felt it at times?) was heavy upon her.  It suddenly<br>occurred to her, what she had only been dimly aware of before, that<br>she had taken this teaching job under flagrantly false pretences,<br>without having any kind of qualification for it.  The subject she<br>was now supposed to be teaching was history, and, like most<br>'educated' people, she knew virtually no history.  How awful, she<br>thought, if it turned out that these girls knew more history than<br>she did!  She said tentatively:<br><br>'What period exactly were you doing with Miss Strong?'<br><br>Nobody answered.  Dorothy saw the older girls exchanging glances,<br>as though asking one another whether it was safe to say anything,<br>and finally deciding not to commit themselves.<br><br>'Well, whereabouts had you got to?' she said, wondering whether<br>perhaps the word 'period' was too much for them.<br><br>Again no answer.<br><br>'Well, now, surely you remember SOMETHING about it?  Tell me the<br>names of some of the people you were learning about in your last<br>history lesson.'<br><br>More glances were exchanged, and a very plain little girl in the<br>front row, in a brown jumper and skirt, with her hair screwed into<br>two tight pigtails, remarked cloudily, 'It was about the Ancient<br>Britons.'  At this two other girls took courage, and answered<br>simultaneously.  One of them said, 'Columbus', and the other<br>'Napoleon'.<br><br>Somehow, after that, Dorothy seemed to see her way more clearly.<br>It was obvious that instead of being uncomfortably knowledgeable as<br>she had feared, the class knew as nearly as possible no history at<br>all.  With this discovery her stage-fright vanished.  She grasped<br>that before she could do anything else with them it was necessary<br>to find out what, if anything, these children knew.  So, instead of<br>following the time-table, she spent the rest of the morning in<br>questioning the entire class on each subject in turn; when she had<br>finished with history (and it took about five minutes to get to the<br>bottom of their historical knowledge) she tried them with geography,<br>with English grammar, with French, with arithmetic--with everything,<br>in fact, that they were supposed to have learned.  By twelve o'clock<br>she had plumbed, though not actually explored, the frightful abysses<br>of their ignorance.<br><br>For they knew nothing, absolutely nothing--nothing, nothing,<br>nothing, like the Dadaists.  It was appalling that even children<br>could be so ignorant.  There were only two girls in the class who<br>knew whether the earth went round the sun or the sun round the<br>earth, and not a single one of them could tell Dorothy who was the<br>last king before George V, or who wrote Hamlet, or what was meant<br>by a vulgar fraction, or which ocean you crossed to get to America,<br>the Atlantic or the Pacific.  And the big girls of fifteen were not<br>much better than the tiny infants of eight, except that the former<br>could at least read consecutively and write neat copperplate.  That<br>was the one thing that nearly all of the older girls could do--they<br>could write neatly.  Mrs Creevy had seen to that.  And of course,<br>here and there in the midst of their ignorance, there were small,<br>disconnected islets of knowledge; for example, some odd stanzas<br>from 'pieces of poetry' that they had learned by heart, and a few<br>Ollendorffian French sentences such as 'Passez-moi le beurre, s'il<br>vous plait' and 'Le fils du jardinier a perdu son chapeau', which<br>they appeared to have learned as a parrot learns 'Pretty Poll'.  As<br>for their arithmetic, it was a little better than the other<br>subjects.  Most of them knew how to add and subtract, about half of<br>them had some notion of how to multiply, and there were even three<br>or four who had struggled as far as long division.  But that was<br>the utmost limit of their knowledge; and beyond, in every direction,<br>lay utter, impenetrable night.<br><br>Moreover, not only did they know nothing, but they were so unused<br>to being questioned that it was often difficult to get answers out<br>of them at all.  It was obvious that whatever they knew they had<br>learned in an entirely mechanical manner, and they could only gape<br>in a sort of dull bewilderment when asked to think for themselves.<br>However, they did not seem unwilling, and evidently they had made<br>up their minds to be 'good'--children are always 'good' with a new<br>teacher; and Dorothy persisted, and by degrees the children grew,<br>or seemed to grow, a shade less lumpish.  She began to pick up,<br>from the answers they gave her, a fairly accurate notion of what<br>Miss Strong's regime had been like.<br><br>It appeared that, though theoretically they had learned all the<br>usual school subjects, the only ones that had been at all seriously<br>taught were handwriting and arithmetic.  Mrs Creevy was particularly<br>keen on handwriting.  And besides this they had spent great<br>quantities of time--an hour or two out of every day, it seemed--in<br>drudging through a dreadful routine called 'copies.'  'Copies' meant<br>copying things out of textbooks or off the blackboard.  Miss Strong<br>would write up, for example, some sententious little 'essay' (there<br>was an essay entitled 'Spring' which recurred in all the older<br>girls' books, and which began, 'Now, when girlish April is tripping<br>through the land, when the birds are chanting gaily on the boughs<br>and the dainty flowerets bursting from their buds', etc., etc.), and<br>the girls would make fair copies of it in their copybooks; and the<br>parents, to whom the copybooks were shown from time to time, were no<br>doubt suitably impressed.  Dorothy began to grasp that everything<br>that the girls had been taught was in reality aimed at the parents.<br>Hence the 'copies', the insistence on handwriting, and the parroting<br>of ready-made French phrases; they were cheap and easy ways of<br>creating an impression.  Meanwhile, the little girls at the bottom<br>of the class seemed barely able to read and write, and one of them--<br>her name was Mavis Williams, and she was a rather sinister-looking<br>child of eleven, with eyes too far apart--could not even count.  This<br>child seemed to have done nothing at all during the past term and a<br>half except to write pothooks.  She had quite a pile of books filled<br>with pothooks--page after page of pothooks, looping on and on like<br>the mangrove roots in some tropical swamp.<br><br>Dorothy tried not to hurt the children's feelings by exclaiming at<br>their ignorance, but in her heart she was amazed and horrified.<br>She had not known that schools of this description still existed in<br>the civilized world.  The whole atmosphere of the place was so<br>curiously antiquated--so reminiscent of those dreary little private<br>schools that you read about in Victorian novels.  As for the few<br>textbooks that the class possessed, you could hardly look at them<br>without feeling as though you had stepped back into the mid<br>nineteenth century.  There were only three textbooks of which each<br>child had a copy.  One was a shilling arithmetic, pre Great War but<br>fairly serviceable, and another was a horrid little book called The<br>Hundred Page History of Britain--a nasty little duodecimo book with<br>a gritty brown cover, and, for frontispiece, a portrait of Boadicea<br>with a Union Jack draped over the front of her chariot.  Dorothy<br>opened this book at random, came to page 91, and read:<br><br><br>After the French Revolution was over, the self-styled Emperor<br>Napoleon Buonaparte attempted to set up his sway, but though he won<br>a few victories against continental troops, he soon found that in<br>the 'thin red line' he had more than met his match.  Conclusions<br>were tried upon the field of Waterloo, where 50,000 Britons put to<br>flight 70,000 Frenchmen--for the Prussians, our allies, arrived too<br>late for the battle.  With a ringing British cheer our men charged<br>down the slope and the enemy broke and fled.  We now come on to the<br>great Reform Bill of 1832, the first of those beneficent reforms<br>which have made British liberty what it is and marked us off from<br>the less fortunate nations [etc., etc.]. . . .<br><br><br>The date of the book was 1888.  Dorothy, who had never seen a<br>history book of this description before, examined it with a feeling<br>approaching horror.  There was also an extraordinary little<br>'reader', dated 1863.  It consisted mostly of bits out of Fenimore<br>Cooper, Dr Watts, and Lord Tennyson, and at the end there were the<br>queerest little 'Nature Notes' with woodcut illustrations.  There<br>would be a woodcut of an elephant, and underneath in small print:<br>'The elephant is a sagacious beast.  He rejoices in the shade of<br>the Palm Trees, and though stronger than six horses he will allow a<br>little child to lead him.  His food is Bananas.'  And so on to the<br>Whale, the Zebra, and Porcupine, and the Spotted Camelopard.  There<br>were also, in the teacher's desk, a copy of Beautiful Joe, a<br>forlorn book called Peeps at Distant Lands, and a French phrase-<br>book dated 1891.  It was called All you will need on your Parisian<br>Trip, and the first phrase given was 'Lace my stays, but not too<br>tightly'.  In the whole room there was not such a thing as an atlas<br>or a set of geometrical instruments.<br><br>At eleven there was a break of ten minutes, and some of the girls<br>played dull little games at noughts and crosses or quarrelled over<br>pencil-cases, and a few who had got over their first shyness<br>clustered round Dorothy's desk and talked to her.  They told her<br>some more about Miss Strong and her methods of teaching, and how<br>she used to twist their ears when they made blots on their<br>copybooks.  It appeared that Miss Strong had been a very strict<br>teacher except when she was 'taken bad', which happened about twice<br>a week.  And when she was taken bad she used to drink some medicine<br>out of a little brown bottle, and after drinking it she would grow<br>quite jolly for a while and talk to them about her brother in<br>Canada.  But on her last day--the time when she was taken so bad<br>during the arithmetic lesson--the medicine seemed to make her worse<br>than ever, because she had no sooner drunk it than she began<br>sinking and fell across a desk, and Mrs Creevy had to carry her out<br>of the room.<br><br>After the break there was another period of three quarters of an<br>hour, and then school ended for the morning.  Dorothy felt stiff<br>and tired after three hours in the chilly but stuffy room, and she<br>would have liked to go out of doors for a breath of fresh air, but<br>Mrs Creevy had told her beforehand that she must come and help get<br>dinner ready.  The girls who lived near the school mostly went home<br>for dinner, but there were seven who had dinner in the 'morning-<br>room' at tenpence a time.  It was an uncomfortable meal, and passed<br>in almost complete silence, for the girls were frightened to talk<br>under Mrs Creevy's eye.  The dinner was stewed scrag end of mutton,<br>and Mrs Creevy showed extraordinary dexterity in serving the pieces<br>of lean to the 'good payers' and the pieces of fat to the 'medium<br>payers'.  As for the three 'bad payers', they ate a shamefaced<br>lunch out of paper bags in the school-room.<br><br>School began again at two o'clock.  Already, after only one<br>morning's teaching, Dorothy went back to her work with secret<br>shrinking and dread.  She was beginning to realize what her life<br>would be like, day after day and week after week, in that sunless<br>room, trying to drive the rudiments of knowledge into unwilling<br>brats.  But when she had assembled the girls and called their names<br>over, one of them, a little peaky child with mouse-coloured hair,<br>called Laura Firth, came up to her desk and presented her with a<br>pathetic bunch of browny-yellow chrysanthemums, 'from all of us'.<br>The girls had taken a liking to Dorothy, and had subscribed<br>fourpence among themselves, to buy her a bunch of flowers.<br><br>Something stirred in Dorothy's heart as she took the ugly flowers.<br>She looked with more seeing eyes than before at the anaemic faces<br>and shabby clothes of the children, and was all of a sudden<br>horribly ashamed to think that in the morning she had looked at<br>them with indifference, almost with dislike.  Now, a profound pity<br>took possession of her.  The poor children, the poor children!  How<br>they had been stunted and maltreated!  And with it all they had<br>retained the childish gentleness that could make them squander<br>their few pennies on flowers for their teacher.<br><br>She felt quite differently towards her job from that moment<br>onwards.  A feeling of loyalty and affection had sprung up in her<br>heart.  This school was HER school; she would work for it and be<br>proud of it, and make every effort to turn it from a place of<br>bondage into a place human and decent.  Probably it was very little<br>that she could do.  She was so inexperienced and unfitted for her<br>job that she must educate herself before she could even begin to<br>educate anybody else.  Still, she would do her best; she would do<br>whatever willingness and energy could do to rescue these children<br>from the horrible darkness in which they had been kept.<br><br><br><br>3<br><br><br>During the next few weeks there were two things that occupied<br>Dorothy to the exclusion of all others.  One, getting her class<br>into some kind of order; the other, establishing a concordat with<br>Mrs Creevy.<br><br>The second of the two was by a great deal the more difficult.  Mrs<br>Creevy's house was as vile a house to live in as one could possibly<br>imagine.  It was always more or less cold, there was not a<br>comfortable chair in it from top to bottom, and the food was<br>disgusting.  Teaching is harder work than it looks, and a teacher<br>needs good food to keep him going.  It was horribly dispiriting to<br>have to work on a diet of tasteless mutton stews, damp boiled<br>potatoes full of little black eyeholes, watery rice puddings, bread<br>and scrape, and weak tea--and never enough even of these.  Mrs<br>Creevy, who was mean enough to take a pleasure in skimping even her<br>own food, ate much the same meals as Dorothy, but she always had<br>the lion's share of them.  Every morning at breakfast the two fried<br>eggs were sliced up and unequally partitioned, and the dish of<br>marmalade remained for ever sacrosanct.  Dorothy grew hungrier and<br>hungrier as the term went on.  On the two evenings a week when she<br>managed to get out of doors she dipped into her dwindling store of<br>money and bought slabs of plain chocolate, which she ate in the<br>deepest secrecy--for Mrs Creevy, though she starved Dorothy more or<br>less intentionally, would have been mortally offended if she had<br>known that she bought food for herself.<br><br>The worst thing about Dorothy's position was that she had no<br>privacy and very little time that she could call her own.  Once<br>school was over for the day her only refuge was the 'morning-room',<br>where she was under Mrs Creevy's eye, and Mrs Creevy's leading idea<br>was that Dorothy must never be left in peace for ten minutes<br>together.  She had taken it into her head, or pretended to do so,<br>that Dorothy was an idle person who needed keeping up to the mark.<br>And so it was always, 'Well, Miss Millborough, you don't seem to<br>have very much to do this evening, do you?  Aren't there some<br>exercise books that want correcting?  Or why don't you get your<br>needle and do a bit of sewing?  I'm sure _I_ couldn't bear to just<br>sit in my chair doing nothing like you do!'  She was for ever<br>finding household jobs for Dorothy to do, even making her scrub the<br>schoolroom floor on Saturday mornings when the girls did not come<br>to school; but this was done out of pure ill nature, for she did<br>not trust Dorothy to do the work properly, and generally did it<br>again after her.  One evening Dorothy was unwise enough to bring<br>back a novel from the public library.  Mrs Creevy flared up at the<br>very sight of it.  'Well, really, Miss Millborough!  I shouldn't<br>have thought you'd have had time to READ!' she said bitterly.  She<br>herself had never read a book right through in her life, and was<br>proud of it.<br><br>Moreover, even when Dorothy was not actually under her eye, Mrs<br>Creevy had ways of making her presence felt.  She was for ever<br>prowling in the neighbourhood of the schoolroom, so that Dorothy<br>never felt quite safe from her intrusion; and when she thought<br>there was too much noise she would suddenly rap on the wall with<br>her broom-handle in a way that made the children jump and put them<br>off their work.  At all hours of the day she was restlessly,<br>noisily active.  When she was not cooking meals she was banging<br>about with broom and dustpan, or harrying the charwoman, or<br>pouncing down upon the schoolroom to 'have a look round' in hopes<br>of catching Dorothy or the children up to mischief, or 'doing a bit<br>of gardening'--that is, mutilating with a pair of shears the<br>unhappy little shrubs that grew amid wastes of gravel in the back<br>garden.  On only two evenings a week was Dorothy free of her, and<br>that was when Mrs Creevy sallied forth on forays which she called<br>'going after the girls'; that is to say, canvassing likely parents.<br>These evenings Dorothy usually spent in the public library, for<br>when Mrs Creevy was not at home she expected Dorothy to keep out of<br>the house, to save fire and gaslight.  On other evenings Mrs Creevy<br>was busy writing dunning letters to the parents, or letters to the<br>editor of the local paper, haggling over the price of a dozen<br>advertisements, or poking about the girls' desks to see that their<br>exercise books had been properly corrected, or 'doing a bit of<br>sewing'.  Whenever occupation failed her for even five minutes she<br>got out her workbox and 'did a bit of sewing'--generally<br>restitching some bloomers of harsh white linen of which she had<br>pairs beyond number.  They were the most chilly looking garments<br>that one could possibly imagine; they seemed to carry upon them, as<br>no nun's coif or anchorite's hair shirt could ever have done, the<br>impress of a frozen and awful chastity.  The sight of them set you<br>wondering about the late Mr Creevy, even to the point of wondering<br>whether he had ever existed.<br><br>Looking with an outsider's eye at Mrs Creevy's manner of life, you<br>would have said that she had no PLEASURES whatever.  She never did<br>any of the things that ordinary people do to amuse themselves--<br>never went to the pictures, never looked at a book, never ate<br>sweets, never cooked a special dish for dinner or dressed herself<br>in any kind of finery.  Social life meant absolutely nothing to<br>her.  She had no friends, was probably incapable of imagining such<br>a thing as friendship, and hardly ever exchanged a word with a<br>fellow being except on business.  Of religious belief she had not<br>the smallest vestige.  Her attitude towards religion, though she<br>went to the Baptist Chapel every Sunday to impress the parents with<br>her piety, was a mean anti-clericalism founded on the notion that<br>the clergy are 'only after your money'.  She seemed a creature<br>utterly joyless, utterly submerged by the dullness of her<br>existence.  But in reality it was not so.  There were several<br>things from which she derived acute and inexhaustible pleasure.<br><br>For instance, there was her avarice over money.  It was the leading<br>interest of her life.  There are two kinds of avaricious person--<br>the bold, grasping type who will ruin you if he can, but who never<br>looks twice at twopence, and the petty miser who has not the<br>enterprise actually to MAKE money, but who will always, as the<br>saying goes, take a farthing from a dunghill with his teeth.  Mrs<br>Creevy belonged to the second type.  By ceaseless canvassing and<br>impudent bluff she had worked her school up to twenty-one pupils,<br>but she would never get it much further, because she was too mean<br>to spend money on the necessary equipment and to pay proper wages<br>to her assistant.  The fees the girls paid, or didn't pay, were<br>five guineas a term with certain extras, so that, starve and sweat<br>her assistant as she might, she could hardly hope to make more than<br>a hundred and fifty pounds a year clear profit.  But she was fairly<br>satisfied with that.  It meant more to her to save sixpence than to<br>earn a pound.  So long as she could think of a way of docking<br>Dorothy's dinner of another potato, or getting her exercise books a<br>halfpenny a dozen cheaper, or shoving an unauthorized half guinea<br>on to one of the 'good payers'' bills, she was happy after her<br>fashion.<br><br>And again, in pure, purposeless malignity--in petty acts of spite,<br>even when there was nothing to be gained by them--she had a hobby<br>of which she never wearied.  She was one of those people who<br>experience a kind of spiritual orgasm when they manage to do<br>somebody else a bad turn.  Her feud with Mr Boulger next door--a<br>one-sided affair, really, for poor Mr Boulger was not up to Mrs<br>Creevy's fighting weight--was conducted ruthlessly, with no quarter<br>given or expected.  So keen was Mrs Creevy's pleasure in scoring<br>off Mr Boulger that she was even willing to spend money on it<br>occasionally.  A year ago Mr Boulger had written to the landlord<br>(each of them was for ever writing to the landlord, complaining<br>about the other's behaviour), to say that Mrs Creevy's kitchen<br>chimney smoked into his back windows, and would she please have it<br>heightened two feet.  The very day the landlord's letter reached<br>her, Mrs Creevy called in the bricklayers and had the chimney<br>lowered two feet.  It cost her thirty shillings, but it was worth<br>it.  After that there had been the long guerrilla campaign of<br>throwing things over the garden wall during the night, and Mrs<br>Creevy had finally won with a dustbinful of wet ashes thrown on to<br>Mr Boulger's bed of tulips.  As it happened, Mrs Creevy won a neat<br>and bloodless victory soon after Dorothy's arrival.  Discovering by<br>chance that the roots of Mr Boulger's plum tree had grown under the<br>wall into her own garden, she promptly injected a whole tin of<br>weed-killer into them and killed the tree.  This was remarkable as<br>being the only occasion when Dorothy ever heard Mrs Creevy laugh.<br><br>But Dorothy was too busy, at first, to pay much attention to Mrs<br>Creevy and her nasty characteristics.  She saw quite clearly that<br>Mrs Creevy was an odious woman and that her own position was<br>virtually that of a slave; but it did not greatly worry her.  Her<br>work was too absorbing, too all-important.  In comparison with it,<br>her own comfort and even her future hardly seemed to matter.<br><br>It did not take her more than a couple of days to get her class<br>into running order.  It was curious, but though she had no<br>experience of teaching and no preconceived theories about it, yet<br>from the very first day she found herself, as though by instinct,<br>rearranging, scheming, innovating.  There was so much that was<br>crying out to be done.  The first thing, obviously, was to get rid<br>of the grisly routine of 'copies', and after Dorothy's second day<br>no more 'copies' were done in the class, in spite of a sniff or two<br>from Mrs Creevy.  The handwriting lessons, also, were cut down.<br>Dorothy would have liked to do away with handwriting lessons<br>altogether so far as the older girls were concerned--it seemed to<br>her ridiculous that girls of fifteen should waste time in practising<br>copperplate--but Mrs Creevy would not hear of it.  She seemed to<br>attach an almost superstitious value to handwriting lessons.  And<br>the next thing, of course, was to scrap the repulsive Hundred Page<br>History and the preposterous little 'readers'.  It would have been<br>worse than useless to ask Mrs Creevy to buy new books for the<br>children, but on her first Saturday afternoon Dorothy begged leave<br>to go up to London, was grudgingly given it, and spent two pounds<br>three shillings out of her precious four pounds ten on a dozen<br>secondhand copies of a cheap school edition of Shakespeare, a big<br>second-hand atlas, some volumes of Hans Andersen's stories for the<br>younger children, a set of geometrical instruments, and two pounds<br>of plasticine.  With these, and history books out of the public<br>library, she felt that she could make a start.<br><br>She had seen at a glance that what the children most needed, and<br>what they had never had, was individual attention.  So she began by<br>dividing them up into three separate classes, and so arranging<br>things that two lots could be working by themselves while she 'went<br>through' something with the third.  It was difficult at first,<br>especially with the younger girls, whose attention wandered as soon<br>as they were left to themselves, so that you could never really<br>take your eyes off them.  And yet how wonderfully, how unexpectedly,<br>nearly all of them improved during those first few weeks!  For the<br>most part they were not really stupid, only dazed by a dull,<br>mechanical rigmarole.  For a week, perhaps, they continued<br>unteachable; and then, quite suddenly, their warped little minds<br>seemed to spring up and expand like daisies when you move the<br>garden roller off them.<br><br>Quite quickly and easily Dorothy broke them in to the habit of<br>thinking for themselves.  She got them to make up essays out of<br>their own heads instead of copying out drivel about the birds<br>chanting on the boughs and the flowerets bursting from their buds.<br>She attacked their arithmetic at the foundations and started the<br>little girls on multiplication and piloted the older ones throu<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/A_Clergyman's_Daughter/2.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/A_Clergyman's_Daughter/4.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
