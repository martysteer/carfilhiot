<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">There are about 400,000 known Jews in Britain, and in addition some<br>thousands or, at most, scores of thousands of Jewish refugees who have<br>entered the country from 1934 onwards. The Jewish population is almost<br>entirely concentrated in half a dozen big towns and is mostly employed<br>in the food, clothing and furniture trades. A few of the big monopolies,<br>such as the ICI, one or two leading newspapers and at least one big<br>chain of department stores are Jewish-owned or partly Jewish-owned, but<br>it would be very far from the truth to say that British business life is<br>dominated by Jews. The Jews seem, on the contrary, to have failed to<br>keep up with the modern tendency towards big amalgamations and to have<br>remained fixed in those trades which are necessarily carried out on a<br>small scale and by old-fashioned methods.<br><br>I start off with these background facts, which are already known to any<br>well-informed person, in order to emphasise that there is no real Jewish<br>"problem" in England. The Jews are not numerous or powerful enough, and<br>it is only in what are loosely called "intellectual circles" that they<br>have any noticeable influence. Yet it is generally admitted that<br>antisemitism is on the increase, that it has been greatly exacerbated by<br>the war, and that humane and enlightened people are not immune to it. It<br>does not take violent forms (English people are almost invariably gentle<br>and law-abiding), but it is ill-natured enough, and in favourable<br>circumstances it could have political results. Here are some samples of<br>antisemitic remarks that have been made to me during the past year or<br>two:<br><br><br>Middle-aged office employee: "I generally come to work by bus. It takes<br>longer, but I don't care about using the Underground from Golders Green<br>nowadays. There's too many of the Chosen Race travelling on that line."<br><br>Tobacconist (woman): "No, I've got no matches for you. I should try the<br>lady down the street. SHE'S always got matches. One of the Chosen Race,<br>you see."<br><br>Young intellectual, Communist or near-Communist: "No, I do NOT like<br>Jews. I've never made any secret of that. I can't stick them. Mind you,<br>I'm not antisemitic, of course."<br><br>Middle-class woman: "Well, no one could call me antisemitic, but I do<br>think the way these Jews behave is too absolutely stinking. The way they<br>push their way to the head of queues, and so on. They're so abominably<br>selfish. I think they're responsible for a lot of what happens to them."<br><br>Milk roundsman: "A Jew don't do no work, not the same as what an<br>Englishman does. 'E's too clever. We work with this 'ere" (flexes his<br>biceps). "They work with that there" (taps his forehead).<br><br>Chartered accountant, intelligent, left-wing in an undirected way:<br>"These bloody Yids are all pro-German. They'd change sides tomorrow if<br>the Nazis got here. I see a lot of them in my business. They admire<br>Hitler at the bottom of their hearts. They'll always suck up to anyone<br>who kicks them."<br><br>Intelligent woman, on being offered a book dealing with antisemitism and<br>German atrocities: "Don't show it me, PLEASE don't show it to me. It'll<br>only make me hate the Jews more than ever."<br><br><br>I could fill pages with similar remarks, but these will do to go on<br>with. Two facts emerge from them. One--which is very important and which<br>I must return to in a moment--is that above a certain intellectual level<br>people are ashamed of being antisemitic and are careful to draw a<br>distinction between "antisemitism" and "disliking Jews". The other is<br>that antisemitism is an irrational thing. The Jews are accused of<br>specific offences (for instance, bad behaviour in food queues) which the<br>person speaking feels strongly about, but it is obvious that these<br>accusations merely rationalise some deep-rooted prejudice. To attempt to<br>counter them with facts and statistics is useless, and may sometimes be<br>worse than useless. As the last of the above-quoted remarks shows,<br>people can remain antisemitic, or at least anti-Jewish, while being<br>fully aware that their outlook is indefensible. If you dislike somebody,<br>you dislike him and there is an end of it: your feelings are not made<br>any better by a recital of his virtues.<br><br>It so happens that the war has encouraged the growth of antisemitism and<br>even, in the eyes of many ordinary people, given some justification for<br>it. To begin with, the Jews are one people of whom it can be said with<br>complete certainty that they will benefit by an Allied victory.<br>Consequently the theory that "this is a Jewish war" has a certain<br>plausibility, all the more so because the Jewish war effort seldom gets<br>its fair share of recognition. The British Empire is a huge<br>heterogeneous organisation held together largely by mutual consent, and<br>it is often necessary to flatter the less reliable elements at the<br>expense of the more loyal ones. To publicise the exploits of Jewish<br>soldiers, or even to admit the existence of a considerable Jewish army<br>in the Middle East, rouses hostility in South Africa, the Arab coun<br>tries and elsewhere: it is easier to ignore the whole subject and allow<br>the man in the street to go on thinking that Jews are exceptionally<br>clever at dodging military service. Then again, Jews are to be found in<br>exactly those trades which are bound to incur unpopularity with the<br>civilian public in war-time. Jews are mostly concerned with selling<br>food, clothes, furniture and tobacco--exactly the commodities of which<br>there is a chronic shortage, with consequent overcharging,<br>black-marketing and favouritism. And again, the common charge that Jews<br>behave in an exceptionally cowardly way during air raids was given a<br>certain amount of colour by the big raids of 1940. As it happened, the<br>Jewish quarter of Whitechapel was one of the first areas to be heavily<br>blitzed, with the natural result that swarms of Jewish refugees<br>distributed themselves all over London. If one judged merely from these<br>war-time phenomena, it would be easy to imagine that antisemitism is a<br>quasi-rational thing, founded on mistaken premises. And naturally the<br>antisemite thinks of himself as a reasonable being. Whenever I have<br>touched on this subject in a newspaper article, I have always had a<br>considerable "come-back", and invariably some of the letters are from<br>well-balanced, middling people--doctors, for example--with no apparent<br>economic grievance. These people always say (as Hitler says in MEIN KAMPF)<br>that they started out with no anti-Jewish prejudice but were driven into<br>their present position by mere observation of the facts. Yet one of the<br>marks of antisemitism is an ability to believe stories that could not<br>possibly be true. One could see a good example of this in the strange<br>accident that occurred in London in 1942, when a crowd, frightened by a<br>bomb-burst nearby, fled into the mouth of an Underground station, with the<br>result that something over a hundred people were crushed to death. The<br>very same day it was repeated all over London that "the Jews were<br>responsible". Clearly, if people will believe this kind of thing, one will<br>not get much further by arguing with them. The only useful approach is to<br>discover WHY they can swallow absurdities on one particular subject while<br>remaining sane on others.<br><br>But now let me come back to that point I mentioned earlier--that there<br>is widespread awareness of the prevalence of antisemitic feeling, and<br>unwillingness to admit sharing it. Among educated people, antisemitism<br>is held to be an unforgivable sin and in a quite different category from<br>other kinds of racial prejudice. People will go to remarkable lengths to<br>demonstrate that they are NOT antisemitic. Thus, in 1943 an intercession<br>service on behalf of the Polish Jews was held in a synagogue in St<br>John's Wood. The local authorities declared themselves anxious to<br>participate in it, and the service was attended by the mayor of the<br>borough in his robes and chain, by representatives of all the churches,<br>and by detachments of RAF, Home Guards, nurses, Boy Scouts and what not.<br>On the surface it was a touching demonstration of solidarity with the<br>suffering Jews. But it was essentially a CONSCIOUS effort to behave<br>decently by people whose subjective feelings must in many cases have<br>been very different. That quarter of London is partly Jewish,<br>antisemitism is rife there, and, as I well knew, some of the men sitting<br>round me in the synagogue were tinged by it. Indeed, the commander of my<br>own platoon of Home Guards, who had been especially keen beforehand that<br>we should "make a good show" at the intercession service, was an<br>ex-member of Mosley's Blackshirts. While this division of feeling<br>exists, tolerance of mass violence against Jews, or, what is more<br>important, antisemitic legislation, are not possible in England. It is<br>not at present possible, indeed, that antisemitism should BECOME<br>RESPECTABLE. But this is less of an advantage than it might appear.<br><br>One effect of the persecutions in Germany has been to prevent<br>antisemitism from being seriously studied. In England a brief inadequate<br>survey was made by Mass Observation a year or two ago, but if there has<br>been any other investigation of the subject, then its findings have been<br>kept strictly secret. At the same time there has been conscious<br>suppression, by all thoughtful people, of anything likely to wound<br>Jewish susceptibilities. After 1934 the Jew joke disappeared as though<br>by magic from postcards, periodicals and the music-hall stage, and to<br>put an unsympathetic Jewish character into a novel or short story came<br>to be regarded as antisemitism. On the Palestine issue, too, it was DE<br>RIGUEUR among enlightened people to accept the Jewish case as proved and<br>avoid examining the claims of the Arabs--a decision which might be<br>correct on its own merits, but which was adopted primarily because the<br>Jews were in trouble and it was felt that one must not criticise them.<br>Thanks to Hitler, therefore, you had a situation in which the press was<br>in effect censored in favour of the Jews while in private antisemitism<br>was on the up-grade, even, to some extent, among sensitive and<br>intelligent people. This was particularly noticeable in 1940 at the time<br>of the internment of the refugees. Naturally, every thinking person felt<br>that it was his duty to protest against the wholesale locking-up of<br>unfortunate foreigners who for the most part were only in England<br>because they were opponents of Hitler. Privately, however, one heard<br>very different sentiments expressed. A minority of the refugees behaved<br>in an exceedingly tactless way, and the feeling against them necessarily<br>had an antisemitic undercurrent, since they were largely Jews. A very<br>eminent figure in the Labour Party--I won't name him, but he is one of<br>the most respected people in England--said to me quite violently: "We<br>never asked these people to come to this country. If they choose to come<br>here, let them take the consequences." Yet this man would as a matter of<br>course have associated himself with any kind of petition or manifesto<br>against the internment of aliens. This feeling that antisemitism is<br>something sinful and disgraceful, something that a civilised person does<br>not suffer from, is unfavourable to a scientific approach, and indeed<br>many people will admit that they are frightened of probing too deeply<br>into the subject. They are frightened, that is to say, of discovering<br>not only that antisemitism is spreading, but that they themselves are<br>infected by it.<br><br>To see this in perspective one must look back a few decades, to the days<br>when Hitler was an out-of-work house-painter whom nobody had heard of.<br>One would then find that though antisemitism is sufficiently in evidence<br>now, it is probably LESS prevalent in England than it was thirty years<br>ago. It is true that antisemitism as a fully thought-out racial or<br>religious doctrine has never flourished in England. There has never been<br>much feeling against inter-marriage, or against Jews taking a prominent<br>part in public life. Nevertheless, thirty years ago it was accepted more<br>or less as a law of nature that a Jew was a figure of fun and--though<br>superior in intelligence--slightly deficient in "character". In theory a<br>Jew suffered from no legal disabilities, but in effect he was debarred<br>from certain professions. He would probably not have been accepted as an<br>officer in the navy, for instance, nor in what is called a "smart"<br>regiment in the army. A Jewish boy at a public school almost invariably<br>had a bad time. He could, of course, live down his Jewishness if he was<br>exceptionally charming or athletic, but it was an initial disability<br>comparable to a stammer or a birthmark. Wealthy Jews tended to disguise<br>themselves under aristocratic English or Scottish names, and to the<br>average person it seemed quite natural that they should do this, just as<br>it seems natural for a criminal to change his identity if possible.<br>About twenty years ago, in Rangoon, I was getting into a taxi with a<br>friend when a small ragged boy of fair complexion rushed up to us and<br>began a complicated story about having arrived from Colombo on a ship<br>and wanting money to get back. His manner and appearance were difficult<br>to "place", and I said to him:<br><br>"You speak very good English. What nationality are you?"<br><br>He answered eagerly in his chi-chi accent: "I am a JOO, sir!"<br><br>And I remember turning to my companion and saying, only partly in joke,<br>"He admits it openly." All the Jews I had known till then were people<br>who were ashamed of being Jews, or at any rate preferred not to talk<br>about their ancestry, and if forced to do so tended to use the word<br>"Hebrew".<br><br>The working-class attitude was no better. The Jew who grew up in<br>Whitechapel took it for granted that he would be assaulted, or at least<br>hooted at, if he ventured into one of the Christian slums nearby, and<br>the "Jew joke" of the music halls and the comic papers was almost<br>consistently ill-natured. [Note at end of paragraph] There was also<br>literary Jew-baiting, which in the hands of Belloc, Chesterton and their<br>followers reached an almost continental level of scurrility. Non-Catholic<br>writers were sometimes guilty of the same thing in a milder form. There<br>has been a perceptible antisemitic strain in English literature from<br>Chaucer onwards, and without even getting up from this table to consult a<br>book I can think of passages which IF WRITTEN NOW would be stigmatised as<br>antisemitism, in the works of Shakespeare, Smollett, Thackeray, Bernard<br>Shaw, H. G. Wells, T. S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley and various others. Offhand,<br>the only English writers I can think of who, before the days of Hitler,<br>made a definite effort to stick up for Jews are Dickens and Charles Reade.<br>And however little the average intellectual may have agreed with the<br>opinions of Belloc and Chesterton, he did not acutely disapprove of<br>them. Chesterton's endless tirades against Jews, which he thrust into<br>stories and essays upon the flimsiest pretexts, never got him into<br>trouble--indeed Chesterton was one of the most generally respected<br>figures in English literary life. Anyone who wrote in that strain NOW<br>would bring down a storm of abuse upon himself, or more probably would<br>find it impossible to get his writings published.<br><br>[Note: It is interesting to compare the "Jew joke" with that other<br>stand-by of the music halls, the "Scotch joke", which superficially it<br>resembles. Occasionally a story is told (e.g. the Jew and the Scotsman who<br>went into a pub together and both died of thirst) which puts both races on<br>an equality, but in general the Jew is credited MERELY with cunning and<br>avarice while the Scotsman is credited with physical hardihood as well.<br>This is seen, for example, in the story of the Jew and the Scotsman who<br>go together to a meeting which has been advertised as free. Unexpectedly<br>there is a collection, and to avoid this the Jew faints and the Scotsman<br>carries him out. Here the Scotsman performs the athletic feat of<br>carrying the other. It would seem vaguely wrong if it were the other way<br>about. (Author's footnote.)]<br><br>If, as I suggest, prejudice against Jews has always been pretty<br>widespread in England, there is no reason to think that Hitler has<br>genuinely diminished it. He has merely caused a sharp division between<br>the politically conscious person who realises that this is not a time to<br>throw stones at the Jews, and the unconscious person whose native<br>antisemitism is increased by the nervous strain of the war. One can<br>assume, therefore, that many people who would perish rather than admit<br>to antisemitic feelings are secretly prone to them. I have already<br>indicated that I believe antisemitism to be essentially a neurosis,<br>but of course it has its rationalisations, which are sincerely<br>believed in and are partly true. The rationalisation put forward by the<br>common man is that the Jew is an exploiter. The partial justification<br>for this is that the Jew, in England, is generally a small<br>businessman--that is to say a person whose depredations are more obvious<br>and intelligible than those of, say, a bank or an insurance company.<br>Higher up the intellectual scale, antisemitism is rationalised by saying<br>that the Jew is a person who spreads disaffection and weakens national<br>morale. Again there is some superficial justification for this. During<br>the past twenty-five years the activities of what are called<br>"intellectuals" have been largely mischievous. I do not think it an<br>exaggeration to say that if the "intellectuals" had done their work a<br>little more thoroughly, Britain would have surrendered in 1940. But the<br>disaffected intelligentsia inevitably included a large number of Jews.<br>With some plausibility it can be said that the Jews are the enemies of<br>our native culture and our national morale. Carefully examined, the<br>claim is seen to be nonsense, but there are always a few prominent<br>individuals who can be cited in support of it. During the past few years<br>there has been what amounts to a counter-attack against the rather<br>shallow Leftism which was fashionable in the previous decade and which<br>was exemplified by such organisations as the Left Book Club. This<br>counter-attack (see for instance such books as Arnold Lutin's THE GOOD<br>GORILLA or Evelyn Waugh's PUT OUT MORE FLAGS) has an antisemitic strain,<br>and it would probably be more marked if the subject were not so<br>obviously dangerous. It so happens that for some decades past Britain<br>has had no nationalist intelligentsia worth bothering about. But British<br>nationalism, i.e. nationalism of an intellectual kind, may revive, and<br>probably will revive if Britain comes out of the present war greatly<br>weakened. The young intellectuals of 1950 may be as naively patriotic as<br>those of 1914. In that case the kind of antisemitism which flourished<br>among the anti-Dreyfusards in France, and which Chesterton and Belloc<br>tried to import into this country, might get a foothold.<br><br>I have no hard-and-fast theory about the origins of antisemitism. The<br>two current explanations, that it is due to economic causes, or on the<br>other hand, that it is a legacy from the Middle Ages, seem to me<br>unsatisfactory, though I admit that if one combines them they can be<br>made to cover the facts. All I would say with confidence is that<br>antisemitism is part of the larger problem of nationalism, which has not<br>yet been seriously examined, and that the Jew is evidently a scapegoat,<br>though for what he is a scapegoat we do not yet know. In this essay I<br>have relied almost entirely on my own limited experience, and perhaps<br>every one of my conclusions would be negatived by other observers. The<br>fact is that there are almost no data on this subject. But for what they<br>are worth I will summarise my opinions. Boiled down, they amount to<br>this:<br><br>There is more antisemitism in England than we care to admit, and the war<br>has accentuated it, but it is not certain that it is on the increase if<br>one thinks in terms of decades rather than years.<br><br>It does not at present lead to open persecution, but it has the effect<br>of making people callous to the sufferings of Jews in other countries.<br><br>It is at bottom quite irrational and will not yield to argument.<br><br>The persecutions in Germany have caused much concealment of antisemitic<br>feeling and thus obscured the whole picture.<br><br>The subject needs serious investigation.<br><br>Only the last point is worth expanding. To study any subject<br>scientifically one needs a detached attitude, which is obviously harder<br>when one's own interests or emotions are involved. Plenty of people who<br>are quite capable of being objective about sea urchins, say, or the<br>square root of 2, become schizophrenic if they have to think about the<br>sources of their own income. What vitiates nearly all that is written<br>about antisemitism is the assumption in the writer's mind that HE<br>HIMSELF is immune to it. "Since I know that antisemitism is irrational,"<br>he argues, "it follows that I do not share it." He thus fails to start<br>his investigation in the one place where he could get hold of some<br>reliable evidence--that is, in his own mind.<br><br>It seems to me a safe assumption that the disease loosely called<br>nationalism is now almost universal. Antisemitism is only one<br>manifestation of nationalism, and not everyone will have the disease in<br>that particular form. A Jew, for example, would not be antisemitic: but<br>then many Zionist Jews seem to me to be merely antisemites turned<br>upside-down, just as many Indians and Negroes display the normal colour<br>prejudices in an inverted form. The point is that something, some<br>psychological vitamin, is lacking in modern civilisation, and as a<br>result we are all more or less subject to this lunacy of believing that<br>whole races or nations are mysteriously good or mysteriously evil. I<br>defy any modern intellectual to look closely and honestly into his own<br>mind without coming upon nationalistic loyalties and hatreds of one kind<br>or another. It is the fact that he can feel the emotional tug of such<br>things, and yet see them dispassionately for what they are, that gives<br>him his status as an intellectual. It will be seen, therefore, that the<br>starting point for any investigation of antisemitism should not be "Why<br>does this obviously irrational belief appeal to other people?" but "Why<br>does antisemitism appeal TO ME? What is there about it that I feel to be<br>true?" If one asks this question one at least discovers one's own<br>rationalisations, and it may be possible to find out what lies beneath<br>them. Antisemitism should be investigated--and I will not say by<br>antisemites, but at any rate by people who know that they are not immune<br>to that kind of emotion. When Hitler has disappeared a real enquiry into<br>this subject will be possible, and it would probably be best to start<br>not by debunking antisemitism, but by marshalling all the justifications<br>for it that can be found, in one's own mind or anybody else's. In that<br>way one might get some clues that would lead to its psychological roots.<br>But that antisemitism will be definitively CURED, without curing the<br>larger disease of nationalism, I do not believe.<br><br></font></p>
