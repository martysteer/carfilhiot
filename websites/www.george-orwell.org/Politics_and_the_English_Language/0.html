<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the<br>English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we<br>cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is<br>decadent, and our language--so the argument runs--must inevitably share<br>in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse<br>of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to<br>electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the<br>half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an<br>instrument which we shape for our own purposes.<br><br>Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have<br>political and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence<br>of this or that individual writer. But an effect can become a cause,<br>reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an<br>intensified form, and so on indefinitely. A man may take to drink because<br>he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely<br>because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the<br>English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are<br>foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to<br>have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible.<br>Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which<br>spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take<br>the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can think more<br>clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step towards political<br>regeneration: so that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and<br>is not the exclusive concern of professional writers. I will come back to<br>this presently, and I hope that by that time the meaning of what I have<br>said here will have become clearer. Meanwhile, here are five specimens of<br>the English language as it is now habitually written.<br><br>These five passages have not been picked out because they are especially<br>bad--I could have quoted far worse if I had chosen--but because they<br>illustrate various of the mental vices from which we now suffer. They are<br>a little below the average, but are fairly representative samples. I<br>number them so that I can refer back to them when necessary:<br><br><br>(1) I am not, indeed, sure whether it is not true to say that the Milton<br>who once seemed not unlike a seventeenth-century Shelley had not become,<br>out of an experience ever more bitter in each year, more alien (sic) to<br>the founder of that Jesuit sect which nothing could induce him to<br>tolerate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  PROFESSOR HAROLD LASKI (Essay in FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION)<br><br>(2) Above all, we cannot play ducks and drakes with a native battery of<br>idioms which prescribes such egregious collocations of vocables as the<br>Basic PUT UP WITH for TOLERATE or PUT AT A LOSS for BEWILDER.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  PROFESSOR LANCELOT HOGBEN (INTERGLOSSA)<br><br>(3) On the one side we have the free personality; by definition it is not<br>neurotic, for it has neither conflict nor dream. Its desires, such as<br>they are, are transparent, for they are just what institutional approval<br>keeps in the forefront of consciousness; another institutional pattern<br>would alter their number and intensity; there is little in them that is<br>natural, irreducible, or culturally dangerous. But ON THE OTHER SIDE, the<br>social bond itself is nothing but the mutual reflection of these<br>self-secure integrities. Recall the definition of love. Is not this the<br>very picture of a small academic? Where is there a place in this hall of<br>mirrors for either personality or fraternity?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Essay on psychology in POLITICS (New York)<br><br>(4) All the "best people" from the gentlemen's clubs, and all the frantic<br>fascist captains, united in common hatred of Socialism and bestial horror<br>of the rising tide of the mass revolutionary movement, have turned to<br>acts of provocation, to foul incendiarism, to medieval legends of<br>poisoned wells, to legalize their own destruction of proletarian<br>organizations, and rouse the agitated petty-bourgeoisie to chauvinistic<br>fervor on behalf of the fight against the revolutionary way out of the<br>crisis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Communist pamphlet<br><br>(5) If a new spirit is to be infused into this old country, there is one<br>thorny and contentious reform which must be tackled, and that is the<br>humanization and galvanization of the B.B.C. Timidity here will bespeak<br>canker and atrophy of the soul. The heart of Britain may lee sound and of<br>strong beat, for instance, but the British lion's roar at present is like<br>that of Bottom in Shakespeare's MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM--as gentle as any<br>sucking dove. A virile new Britain cannot continue indefinitely to be<br>traduced in the eyes, or rather ears, of the world by the effete languors<br>of Langham Place, brazenly masquerading as "standard English." When the<br>Voice of Britain is heard at nine o'clock, better far and infinitely less<br>ludicrous to hear aitches honestly dropped than the present priggish,<br>inflated, inhibited, school-ma'am-ish arch braying of blameless bashful<br>mewing maidens.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Letter in TRIBUNE<br><br><br>Each of these passages has faults of its own, but quite apart from<br>avoidable ugliness, two qualities are common to all of them. The first is<br>staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either<br>has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something<br>else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything<br>or not. This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most<br>marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind<br>of political writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete<br>melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech<br>that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of WORDS chosen for<br>the sake of their meaning, and more and more of PHRASES tacked together<br>like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house. I list below, with notes<br>and examples, various of the tricks by means of which the work of<br>prose-construction is habitually dodged:<br><br><br>DYING METAPHORS. A newly-invented metaphor assists thought by evoking a<br>visual image, while on the other hand a metaphor which is technically<br>"dead" (e.g., IRON RESOLUTION) has in effect reverted to being an<br>ordinary word and can generally be used without loss of vividness. But in<br>between these two classes there is a huge dump of worn-out metaphors<br>which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save<br>people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. Examples are:<br>RING THE CHANGES ON, TAKE UP THE CUDGELS FOR, TOE THE LINE, RIDE<br>ROUGHSHOD OVER, STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH, PLAY INTO THE HANDS OF,<br>AN AXE TO GRIND, GRIST TO THE MILL, FISHING IN TROUBLED WATERS, ON THE<br>ORDER OF THE DAY, ACHILLES' HEEL, SWAN SONG, HOTBED. Many of these are<br>used without knowledge of their meaning (what is a "rift," for<br>instance?), and incompatible metaphors are frequently mixed, a sure sign<br>that the writer is not interested in what he is saying. Some metaphors<br>now current have been twisted out of their original meaning without those<br>who use them even being aware of the fact. For example, TOE THE LINE is<br>sometimes written TOW THE LINE. Another example is THE HAMMER AND THE<br>ANVIL, now always used with the implication that the anvil gets the worst<br>of it. In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer, never<br>the other way about: a writer who stopped to think what he was saying<br>would be aware of this, and would avoid perverting the original phrase.<br><br>OPERATORS, or VERBAL FALSE LIMBS. These save the trouble of picking out<br>appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the same time pad each sentence with<br>extra syllables which give it an appearance of symmetry. Characteristic<br>phrases are: RENDER INOPERATIVE, MILITATE AGAINST, PROVE UNACCEPTABLE,<br>MAKE CONTACT WITH, BE SUBJECTED TO, GIVE RISE TO, GIVE GROUNDS FOR,<br>HAVING THE EFFECT OF, PLAY A LEADING PART (RÔLE) IN, MAKE ITSELF FELT,<br>TAKE EFFECT, EXHIBIT A TENDENCY TO, SERVE THE PURPOSE OF, etc., etc. The<br>keynote is the elimination of simple verbs. Instead of being a single<br>word, such as BREAK, STOP, SPOIL, MEND, KILL, a verb becomes a PHRASE,<br>made up of a noun or adjective tacked on to some general-purposes verb as<br>PROVE, SERVE, FORM, PLAY, RENDER. In addition, the passive voice is<br>wherever possible used in preference to the active, and noun<br>constructions are used instead of gerunds (BY EXAMINATION OF instead of<br>BY EXAMINING). The range of verbs is further cut down by means of the<br>'-IZE' AND 'DE-' formations, and banal statements are given an appearance<br>of profundity by means of the NOT 'UN-' formation. Simple conjunctions and<br>prepositions are replaced by such phrases as WITH RESPECT TO, HAVING<br>REGARD TO, THE FACT THAT, BY DINT OF, IN VIEW OF, IN THE INTERESTS OF, ON<br>THE HYPOTHESIS THAT; and the ends of sentences are saved from anti-climax<br>by such resounding commonplaces as GREATLY TO BE DESIRED, CANNOT BE LEFT<br>OUT OF ACCOUNT, A DEVELOPMENT TO BE EXPECTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE,<br>DESERVING OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION, BROUGHT TO A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION,<br>and so on and so forth.<br><br>PRETENTIOUS DICTION. Words like PHENOMENON, ELEMENT, INDIVIDUAL (as<br>noun), OBJECTIVE, CATEGORICAL, EFFECTIVE, VIRTUAL, BASIS, PRIMARY,<br>PROMOTE, CONSTITUTE, EXHIBIT, EXPLOIT, UTILIZE, ELIMINATE, LIQUIDATE, are<br>used to dress up simple statements and give an air of scientific<br>impartiality to biased judgments. Adjectives like EPOCH-MAKING, EPIC,<br>HISTORIC, UNFORGETTABLE, TRIUMPHANT, AGE-OLD, INEVITABLE, INEXORABLE,<br>VERITABLE, are used to dignify the sordid processes of international<br>politics, while writing that aims at glorifying war usually takes on an<br>archaic color, its characteristic words being: REALM, THRONE, CHARIOT,<br>MAILED FIST, TRIDENT, SWORD, SHIELD, BUCKLER, BANNER, JACKBOOT, CLARION.<br>Foreign words and expressions such as CUL DE SAC, ANCIEN RÉGIME, DEUS EX<br>MACHINA, MUTATIS MUTANDIS, STATUS QUO, GLEICHSCHALTUNG, WELTANSCHAUUNG,<br>are used to give an air of culture and elegance. Except for the useful<br>abbreviations I.E., E.G., and ETC., there is no real need for any of the<br>hundreds of foreign phrases now current in English. Bad writers, and<br>especially scientific, political and sociological writers, are nearly<br>always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than<br>Saxon ones, and unnecessary words like EXPEDITE, AMELIORATE, PREDICT,<br>EXTRANEOUS, DERACINATED, CLANDESTINE, SUB-AQUEOUS and hundreds of others<br>constantly gain ground from their Anglo-Saxon opposite numbers. [Note 1, below]<br>The jargon peculiar to Marxist writing (HYENA, HANGMAN, CANNIBAL, PETTY<br>BOURGEOIS, THESE GENTRY, LACKEY, FLUNKEY, MAD DOG, WHITE GUARD, etc.)<br>consists largely of words and phrases translated from Russian, German or<br>French; but the normal way of coining a new word is to use a Latin or<br>Greek root with the appropriate affix and, where necessary, the '-ize'<br>formation. It is often easier to make up words of this kind<br>(DE-REGIONALIZE, IMPERMISSIBLE, EXTRAMARITAL, NON-FRAGMENTARY and so<br>forth) than to think up the English words that will cover one's meaning.<br>The result, in general, is an increase in slovenliness and vagueness.<br><br><br>[Note: 1. An interesting illustration of this is the way in which the English<br>flower names which were in use till very recently are being ousted by<br>Greek ones, SNAPDRAGON becoming ANTIRRHINUM, FORGET-ME-NOT becoming<br>MYOSOTIS, etc. It is hard to see any practical reason for this change of<br>fashion: it is probably due to an instinctive turning-away from the more<br>homely word and a vague feeling that the Greek word is scientific.<br>(Author's footnote.)]<br><br><br>MEANINGLESS WORDS. In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art<br>criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long<br>passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. [Note, below] Words<br>like ROMANTIC, PLASTIC, VALUES, HUMAN, DEAD, SENTIMENTAL, NATURAL, VITALITY,<br>as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that<br>they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly<br>even expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes, "The<br>outstanding feature of Mr. X's work is its living quality," while another<br>writes, "The immediately striking thing about Mr. X's work is its<br>peculiar deadness," the reader accepts this as a simple difference of<br>opinion If words like BLACK and WHITE were involved, instead of the<br>jargon words DEAD and LIVING, he would see at once that language was<br>being used in an improper way. Many political words are similarly abused.<br>The word FASCISM has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies<br>"something not desirable." The words DEMOCRACY, SOCIALISM, FREEDOM,<br>PATRIOTIC, REALISTIC, JUSTICE, have each of them several different<br>meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a<br>word like DEMOCRACY, not only is there no agreed definition, but the<br>attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally<br>felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it:<br>consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a<br>democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it<br>were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a<br>consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own<br>private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something<br>quite different. Statements like MARSHAL PÉTAIN WAS A TRUE PATRIOT, THE<br>SOVIET PRESS IS THE FREEST IN THE WORLD, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS OPPOSED<br>TO PERSECUTION, are almost always made with intent to deceive. Other<br>words used in variable meanings, in most cases more or less dishonestly,<br>are: CLASS, TOTALITARIAN, SCIENCE, PROGRESSIVE, REACTIONARY BOURGEOIS,<br>EQUALITY.<br><br><br>[Note: Example: "Comfort's catholicity of perception and image, strangely<br>Whitmanesque in range, almost the exact opposite in aesthetic compulsion,<br>continues to evoke that trembling atmospheric accumulative hinting at a<br>cruel, an inexorably serene timelessness . . . Wrey Gardiner scores by<br>aiming at simple bullseyes with precision. Only they are not so simple,<br>and through this contented sadness runs more than the surface bittersweet<br>of resignation." (POETRY QUARTERLY.) (Author's footnote.)]<br><br><br>Now that I have made this catalogue of swindles and perversions, let me<br>give another example of the kind of writing that they lead to. This time<br>it must of its nature be an imaginary one. I am going to translate a<br>passage of good English into modern English of the worst sort. Here is a<br>well-known verse from ECCLESIASTES:<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor<br>the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches<br>to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and<br>chance happeneth<br><br>Here it is in modern English:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion<br>that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to<br>be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of<br>the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.<br><br>This is a parody, but not a very gross one. Exhibit (3), above, for<br>instance, contains several patches of the same kind of English. It will<br>be seen that I have not made a full translation. The beginning and ending<br>of the sentence follow the original meaning fairly closely, but in the<br>middle the concrete illustrations--race, battle, bread--dissolve into the<br>vague phrase "success or failure in competitive activities." This had to<br>be so, because no modern writer of the kind I am discussing--no one<br>capable of using phrases like "objective consideration of contemporary<br>phenomena"--would ever tabulate his thoughts in that precise and detailed<br>way. The whole tendency of modern prose is away from concreteness. Now<br>analyze these two sentences a little more closely. The first contains 49<br>words but only 60 syllables, and all its words are those of everyday<br>life. The second contains 38 words of 90 syllables: 18 of its words are<br>from Latin roots, and one from Greek. The first sentence contains six<br>vivid images, and only one phrase ("time and chance") that could be<br>called vague. The second contains not a single fresh, arresting phrase,<br>and in spite of its 90 syllables it gives only a shortened version of the<br>meaning contained in the first. Yet without a doubt it is the second kind<br>of sentence that is gaining ground in modern English. I do not want to<br>exaggerate. This kind of writing is not yet universal, and outcrops of<br>simplicity will occur here and there in the worst-written page. Still, if<br>you or I were told to write a few lines on the uncertainty of human<br>fortunes, we should probably come much nearer to my imaginary sentence<br>than to the one from ECCLESIASTES.<br><br>As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in<br>picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in<br>order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long<br>strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and<br>making the results presentable by sheer humbug. The attraction of this<br>way of writing, is that it is easy. It is easier--even quicker, once you<br>have the habit--to say IN MY OPINION IT IS A NOT UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSUMPTION<br>THAT than to say I THINK. If you use ready-made phrases, you not only<br>don't have to hunt about for words; you also don't have to bother with<br>the rhythms of your sentences, since these phrases are generally so<br>arranged as to be more or less euphonious. When you are composing in a<br>hurry--when you are dictating to a stenographer, for instance, or making<br>a public speech--it is natural to fall into a pretentious, Latinized<br>style. Tags like A CONSIDERATION WHICH WE SHOULD DO WELL TO BEAR IN MIND<br>OR A CONCLUSION TO WHICH ALL OF US WOULD READILY ASSENT will save many a<br>sentence from coming down with a bump. By using stale metaphors, similes<br>and idioms, you save much mental effort at the cost of leaving your<br>meaning vague, not only for your reader but for yourself. This is the<br>significance of mixed metaphors. The sole aim of a metaphor is to call up<br>a visual image. When these images clash--as in THE FASCIST OCTOPUS HAS<br>SUNG ITS SWAN SONG, THE JACKBOOT IS THROWN INTO THE MELTING POT--it can<br>be taken as certain that the writer is not seeing a mental image of the<br>objects he is naming; in other words he is not really thinking. Look<br>again at the examples I gave at the beginning of this essay. Professor<br>Laski (1) uses five negatives in 53 words. One of these is superfluous,<br>making nonsense of the whole passage, and in addition there is the slip<br>ALIEN for akin, making further nonsense, and several avoidable pieces of<br>clumsiness which increase the general vagueness. Professor Hogben (2)<br>plays ducks and drakes with a battery which is able to write<br>prescriptions, and, while disapproving of the everyday phrase PUT UP<br>WITH, is unwilling to look EGREGIOUS up in the dictionary and see what it<br>means. (3), if one takes an uncharitable attitude towards it, is simply<br>meaningless: probably one could work out its intended meaning by reading<br>the whole of the article in which it occurs. In (4), the writer knows<br>more or less what he wants to say, but an accumulation of stale phrases<br>chokes him like tea leaves blocking a sink. In (5), words and meaning<br>have almost parted company. People who write in this manner usually have<br>a general emotional meaning--they dislike one thing and want to express<br>solidarity with another--but they are not interested in the detail of<br>what they are saying. A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he<br>writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying<br>to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it<br>clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will<br>probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said<br>anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all<br>this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and<br>letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. They will construct your<br>sentences for you--even think your thoughts for you, to a certain<br>extent-and at need they will perform the important service of partially<br>concealing your meaning even from yourself. It is at this point that the<br>special connection between politics and the debasement of language<br>becomes clear.<br><br>In our time it is broadly true that political writing is bad writing.<br>Where it is not true, it will generally be found that the writer is some<br>kind of rebel, expressing his private opinions and not a "party line."<br>Orthodoxy, of whatever color, seems to demand a lifeless, imitative<br>style. The political dialects to be found in pamphlets, leading articles,<br>manifestoes, White Papers and the speeches of under-secretaries do, of<br>course, vary from party to party, but they are all alike in that one<br>almost never finds in them a fresh, vivid, home-made turn of speech. When<br>one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the<br>familiar phrases--BESTIAL ATROCITIES, IRON HEEL, BLOODSTAINED TYRANNY,<br>FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER--one often has a<br>curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind<br>of dummy: a feeling which suddenly becomes stronger at moments when the<br>light catches the speaker's spectacles and turns them into blank discs<br>which seem to have no eyes behind them. And this is not altogether<br>fanciful. A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some<br>distance towards turning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises<br>are coming out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved as it would<br>be if he were choosing his words for himself. If the speech he is making<br>is one that he is accustomed to make over and over again, he may be<br>almost unconscious of what he is saying, as one is when one utters the<br>responses in church. And this reduced state of consciousness, if not<br>indispensable, is at any rate favorable to political conformity.<br><br>In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the<br>indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the<br>Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan,<br>can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for<br>most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of<br>political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of<br>euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless<br>villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the<br>countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with<br>incendiary bullets: this is called PACIFICATION. Millions of peasants are<br>robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than<br>they can carry: this is called TRANSFER OF POPULATION or RECTIFICATION OF<br>FRONTIERS. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the<br>back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is<br>called ELIMINATION OF UNRELIABLE ELEMENTS. Such phraseology is needed if<br>one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them.<br>Consider for instance some comfortable English professor defending<br>Russian totalitarianism. He cannot say outright, "I believe in killing<br>off your opponents when you can get good results by doing so." Probably,<br>therefore, he will say something like this:<br><br><br>While freely conceding that the Soviet régime exhibits certain features<br>which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think,<br>agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is<br>an unavoidable concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigors<br>which the Russian people have been called upon to undergo have been amply<br>justified in the sphere of concrete achievement.<br><br><br>The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words<br>falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outlines and covering<br>up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity.<br>When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one<br>turns, as it were instinctively, to long words and exhausted idioms, like<br>a cuttlefish squirting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as<br>"keeping out of politics." All issues are political issues, and politics<br>itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. When<br>the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. I should expect to<br>find--this is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to<br>verify--that the German, Russian and Italian languages have all<br>deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years as a result of<br>dictatorship.<br><br>But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A<br>bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation, even among people who<br>should and do know better. The debased language that I have been<br>discussing is in some ways very convenient. Phrases like A NOT<br>UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSUMPTION, LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED, WOULD SERVE NO GOOD<br>PURPOSE, A CONSIDERATION WHICH WE SHOULD DO WELL TO BEAR IN MIND, are a<br>continuous temptation, a packet of aspirins always at one's elbow. Look<br>back through this essay, and for certain you will find that I have again<br>and again committed the very faults I am protesting against. By this<br>morning's post I have received a pamphlet dealing with conditions in<br>Germany. The author tells me that he "felt impelled" to write it. I open<br>it at random, and here is almost the first sentence that I see:<br>"[The Allies] have an opportunity not only of achieving a radical<br>transformation of Germany's social and political structure in such a way<br>as to avoid a nationalistic reaction in Germany itself, but at the same<br>time of laying the foundations of a cooperative and unified Europe." You<br>see, he "feels impelled" to write--feels, presumably, that he has<br>something new to say--and yet his words, like cavalry horses answering<br>the bugle, group themselves automatically into the familiar dreary<br>pattern. This invasion of one's mind by ready-made phrases (LAY THE<br>FOUNDATIONS, ACHIEVE A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION) can only be prevented if<br>one is constantly on guard against them, and every such phrase<br>anesthetizes a portion of one's brain.<br><br>I said earlier that the decadence of our language is probably curable.<br>Those who deny this would argue, if they produced an argument at all,<br>that language merely reflects existing social conditions, and that we<br>cannot influence its development by any direct tinkering with words and<br>constructions. So far as the general tone or spirit of a language goes,<br>this may be true, but it is not true in detail. Silly words and<br>expressions have often disappeared, not through any evolutionary process<br>but owing to the conscious action of a minority. Two recent examples were<br>EXPLORE EVERY AVENUE and LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED, which were killed by<br>the jeers of a few journalists. There is a long list of fly-blown<br>metaphors which could similarly be got rid of if enough people would<br>interest themselves in the job; and it should also be possible to laugh<br>the NOT 'UN-' formation out of existence, [Note, below] to reduce the amount<br>of Latin and Greek in the average sentence, to drive out foreign phrases and<br>strayed scientific words, and, in general, to make pretentiousness<br>unfashionable. But all these are minor points. The defense of the English<br>language implies more than this, and perhaps it is best to start by<br>saying what it does NOT imply.<br><br>[Note: One can cure oneself of the NOT 'UN-' formation by memorizing this<br>sentence: A NOT UNBLACK DOG WAS CHASING A NOT UNSMALL RABBIT ACROSS A NOT<br>UNGREEN FIELD. (Author's footnote.)]<br><br>To begin with, it has nothing to do with archaism, with the salvaging of<br>obsolete words and turns of speech, or with the setting-up of a<br>"standard-English" which must never be departed from. On the contrary, it<br>is especially concerned with the scrapping of every word or idiom which<br>has outworn its usefulness. It has nothing to do with correct grammar and<br>syntax, which are of no importance so long as one makes one's meaning<br>clear, or with the avoidance of Americanisms, or with having what is<br>called a "good prose style." On the other hand it is not concerned with<br>fake simplicity and the attempt to make written English colloquial. Nor<br>does it even imply in every case preferring the Saxon word to the Latin<br>one, though it does imply using the fewest and shortest words that will<br>cover one's meaning. What is above all needed is to let the meaning<br>choose the word, and not the other way about. In prose, the worst thing<br>one can do with words is to surrender them. When you think of a concrete<br>object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing<br>you have been visualizing, you probably hunt about till you find the<br>exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract you<br>are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a<br>conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in<br>and do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your<br>meaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible<br>and get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures or sensations.<br>Afterwards one can choose--not simply ACCEPT--the phrases that will best<br>cover the meaning, and then switch round and decide what impressions<br>one's words are likely to make on another person. This last effort of the<br>mind cuts out all stale or mixed images, all prefabricated phrases,<br>needless repetitions, and humbug and vagueness generally. But one can<br>often be in doubt about the effect of a word or a phrase, and one needs<br>rules that one can rely on when instinct fails. I think the following<br>rules will cover most cases:<br><br>(i) Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are<br>used to seeing in print.<br><br>(ii) Never use a long word where a short one will do.<br><br>(iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.<br><br>(iv) Never use the passive where you can use the active.<br><br>(v) Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you<br>can think of an everyday English equivalent.<br><br>(vi) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.<br><br>These rules sound elementary, and so they are, but they demand a deep<br>change of attitude in anyone who has grown used to writing in the style<br>now fashionable. One could keep all of them and still write bad English,<br>but one could not write the kind of stuff that I quoted in these five<br>specimens at the beginning of this article.<br><br>I have not here been considering the literary use of language, but merely<br>language as an instrument for expressing and not for concealing or<br>preventing thought. Stuart Chase and others have come near to claiming<br>that all abstract words are meaningless, and have used this as a pretext<br>for advocating a kind of political quietism. Since you don't know what<br>Fascism is, how can you struggle against Fascism? One need not swallow<br>such absurdities as this, but one ought to recognize that the present<br>political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can<br>probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end. If<br>you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of<br>orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you<br>make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.<br>Political language-and with variations this is true of all political<br>parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists--is designed to make lies sound<br>truthful and murder respectable. and to give an appearance of solidity to<br>pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least<br>change one's own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers<br>loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase--some JACKBOOT,<br>ACHILLES' HEEL, HOTBED, MELTING POT, ACID TEST, VERITABLE INFERNO or<br>other lump of verbal refuse--into the dustbin where it belongs.<br><br></font></p>
