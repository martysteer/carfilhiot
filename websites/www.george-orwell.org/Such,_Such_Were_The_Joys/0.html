<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Soon after I arrived at Crossgates (not immediately, but after a week or<br>two, just when I seemed to be settling into routine of school life) I<br>began wetting my bed. I was now aged eight, so that this was a reversion<br>to a habit which I must have grown out of at least four years earlier.<br><br>Nowadays, I believe, bed-wetting in such circumstances is taken for<br>granted. It is a normal reaction in children who have been removed from<br>their homes to a strange place. In those days, however, it was looked on<br>as a disgusting crime which the child committed on purpose and for which<br>the proper cure was a beating. For my part I did not need to be told it<br>was a crime. Night after night I prayed, with a fervor never previously<br>attained in my prayers, 'Please God, do not let me wet my bed! Oh, please<br>God, do not let me wet my bed!' but it made remarkably little difference.<br>Some nights the thing happened, others not. There was no volition about<br>it, no consciousness. You did not properly speaking do the deed: you were<br>merely woke up in the morning and found that the sheets were wringing<br>wet.<br><br>After the second or third offense I was warned that I should be beaten<br>next time, but I received the warning in a curiously roundabout way. One<br>afternoon, as we were filing out from tea, Mrs. Simpson, the headmaster's<br>wife, was sitting at the head of one of the tables, chatting with a lady<br>of whom I know nothing, except that she was on an afternoon's visit to<br>the school. She was an intimidating, masculine-looking person wearing a<br>riding habit, or something that I took to be a riding habit. I was just<br>leaving the room when Mrs. Simpson called me back, as though to introduce<br>me to the visitor.<br><br>Mrs. Simpson was nicknamed Bingo, and I shall call her by that name for I<br>seldom think of her by any other. (Officially, however, she was addressed<br>as Mum, probably a corruption of the 'Ma'am' used by public school boys<br>to their housemasters' wives.) She was a stocky square-built woman with<br>hard red cheeks, a flat top to her head, prominent brows and deepset,<br>suspicious eyes. Although a great deal of the time she was full of false<br>heartiness, jollying one along with mannish slang ('Buck up, old chap!'<br>and so forth), and even using one's Christian name, her eyes never lost<br>their anxious, accusing look. It was very difficult to look her in the<br>face without feeling guilty, even at moments when one was not guilty of<br>anything in particular.<br><br>'Here is a little boy,' said Bingo, indicating me to the strange lady,<br>'who wets his bed every night. Do you know what I am going to do if you<br>wet your bed again?' she added, turning to me. 'I am going to get the<br>Sixth Form to beat you.'<br><br>The strange lady put on an air of being inexpressibly shocked, and<br>exclaimed 'I-should-think-so!' And here occurred one of those wild,<br>almost lunatic misunderstandings which are part of the daily experience<br>of childhood. The Sixth Form was a group of older boys who were selected<br>as having 'character' and were empowered to beat smaller boys. I had not<br>yet learned of their existence, and I mis-heard the phrase 'the Sixth<br>Form' as 'Mrs. Form.' I took it as referring to the strange lady--I<br>thought, that is, that her name was Mrs. Form. It was an improbable name,<br>but a child has no judgment in such matters. I imagined, therefore, that<br>it was she who was to be deputed to beat me. It did not strike me as<br>strange that this job should be turned over to a casual visitor in no way<br>connected with the school. I merely assumed that 'Mrs. Form' was a stern<br>disciplinarian who enjoyed beating people (somehow her appearance seemed<br>to bear this out) and I had an immediate terrifying vision of her<br>arriving for the occasion in full riding kit and armed with a hunting<br>whip. To this day I can feel myself almost swooning with shame as I<br>stood, a very small, round-faced boy in short corduroy knickers, before<br>the two women. I could not speak. I felt that I should die if 'Mrs. Form'<br>were to beat me. But my dominant feeling was not fear or even resentment:<br>it was simply shame because one more person, and that a woman, had been<br>told of my disgusting offense.<br><br>A little later, I forget how, I learned that it was not after all 'Mrs.<br>Form' who would do the beating. I cannot remember whether it was that<br>very night that I wetted my bed again, but at any rate I did wet it again<br>quite soon. Oh, the despair, the feeling of cruel injustice, after all my<br>prayers and resolutions, at once again waking between the clammy sheets!<br>There was no chance of hiding what I had done. The grim statuesque<br>matron, Daphne by name, arrived in the dormitory specially to inspect my<br>bed. She pulled back the clothes, then drew herself up, and the dreaded<br>words seemed to come rolling out of her like a peal of thunder:<br><br>'REPORT YOURSELF to the headmaster after breakfast!'<br><br>I do not know how many times I heard that phrase during my early years at<br>Crossgates. It was only very rarely that it did not mean a beating. The<br>words always had a portentous sound in my ears, like muffled drums or the<br>words of the death sentence.<br><br>When I arrived to report myself, Bingo was doing something or other at<br>the long shiny table in the ante-room to the study. Her uneasy eyes<br>searched me as I went past. In the study Mr. Simpson, nicknamed Sim, was<br>waiting. Sim was a round-shouldered curiously oafish-looking man, not<br>large but shambling in gait, with a chubby face which was like that of an<br>overgrown baby, and which was capable of good humor. He knew, of course,<br>why I had been sent to him, and had already taken a bone-handled riding<br>crop out of the cupboard, but it was part of the punishment of reporting<br>yourself that you had to proclaim your offense with your own lips. When I<br>had said my say, he read me a short but pompous lecture, then seized me<br>by the scruff of the neck, twisted me over and began beating me with the<br>riding crop. He had a habit of continuing his lecture while he flogged<br>you, and I remember the words 'you dirty little boy' keeping time with<br>the blows. The beating did not hurt (perhaps as it was the first time, he<br>was not hitting me very hard), and I walked out feeling very much better.<br>The fact that the beating had not hurt was a sort of victory and<br>partially wiped out the shame of the bed-wetting. I was even incautious<br>enough to wear a grin on my face. Some small boys were hanging about in<br>the passage outside the door of the ante-room.<br><br>'D'you get the cane?'<br><br>'It didn't hurt,' I said proudly.<br><br>Bingo had heard everything. Instantly her voice came screaming after me:<br><br>'Come here! Come here this instant! What was that you said?'<br><br>'I said it didn't hurt,' I faltered out.<br><br>'How dare you say a thing like that? Do you think that is a proper thing<br>to say? Go in and REPORT YOURSELF AGAIN!'<br><br>This time Sim laid on in real earnest. He continued for a length of time<br>that frightened and astonished me--about five minutes, it seemed--<br>ending up by breaking the riding crop. The bone handle went flying across<br>the room.<br><br>'Look what you've made me do!' he said furiously, holding up the broken<br>crop.<br><br>I had fallen into a chair, weakly sniveling. I remember that this was the<br>only time throughout my boyhood when a beating actually reduced me to<br>tears, and curiously enough I was not even now crying because of the<br>pain. The second beating had not hurt very much either. Fright and shame<br>seemed to have anesthetized me. I was crying partly because I felt that<br>this was expected of me, partly from genuine repentance, but partly also<br>because of a deeper grief which is peculiar to childhood and not easy to<br>convey: a sense of desolate loneliness and helplessness, of being locked<br>up not only in a hostile world but in a world of good and evil where the<br>rules were such that it was actually not possible for me to keep them.<br><br>I knew that bed-wetting was (a) wicked and (b) outside my control. The<br>second fact I was personally aware of, and the first I did not question.<br>It was possible, therefore, to commit a sin without knowing that you<br>committed it, without wanting to commit it, and without being able to<br>avoid it. Sin was not necessarily something that you did: it might be<br>something that happened to you. I do not want to claim that this idea<br>flashed into my mind as a complete novelty at this very moment, under the<br>blows of Sim's cane: I must have had glimpses of it even before I left<br>home, for my early childhood had not been altogether happy. But at any<br>rate this was the great, abiding lesson of my boyhood: that I was in a<br>world where it was not possible for me to be good. And the double beating<br>was a turning-point, for it brought home to me for the first time the<br>harshness of the environment into which I had been flung. Life was more<br>terrible, and I was more wicked, than I had imagined. At any rate, as I<br>sat on the edge of a chair in Sim's study, with not even the<br>self-possession to stand up while he stormed at me, I had a conviction of<br>sin and folly and weakness, such as I do not remember to have felt<br>before.<br><br>In general, one's memories of any period must necessarily weaken as one<br>moves away from it. One is constantly learning new facts, and old ones<br>have to drop out to make way for them. At twenty I could have written the<br>history of my schooldays with an accuracy which would be quite impossible<br>now. But it can also happen that one's memories grow sharper after a long<br>lapse of time, because one is looking at the past with fresh eyes and can<br>isolate and, as it were, notice facts which previously existed<br>undifferentiated among a mass of others. Here are two things which in a<br>sense I remembered, but which did not strike me as strange or interesting<br>until quite recently. One is that the second beating seemed to me a just<br>and reasonable punishment. To get one beating, and then to get another<br>and far fiercer one on top of it, for being so unwise as to show that the<br>first had not hurt--that was quite natural. The gods are jealous, and<br>when you have good fortune you should conceal it. The other is that I<br>accepted the broken riding crop as my own crime. I can still recall my<br>feeling as I saw the handle lying on the carpet--the feeling of having<br>done an ill-bred clumsy thing, and ruined an expensive object. I had<br>broken it: so Sim told me, and so I believed. This acceptance of guilt<br>lay unnoticed in my memory for twenty or thirty years.<br><br>So much for the episode of the bed-wetting. But there is one more thing<br>to be remarked. That is that I did not wet my bed again--at least, I did<br>wet it once again, and received another beating, after which the trouble<br>stopped. So perhaps this barbarous remedy does work, though at a heavy<br>price, I have no doubt.<br><br>All this was thirty years ago and more. The question is: Does a child at<br>school go through the same kind of experiences nowadays?<br><br>The only honest answer, I believe, is that we do not with certainty know.<br>Of course it is obvious that the present-day attitude towards education<br>is enormously more humane and sensible than that of the past. The<br>snobbishness that was an integral part of my own education would be<br>almost unthinkable today, because the society that nourished it is dead.<br>I recall a conversation that must have taken place about a year before I<br>left Crossgates. A Russian boy, large and fair-haired, a year older than<br>myself, was questioning me.<br><br>'How much a-year has your father got?'<br><br>I told him what I thought it was, adding a few hundreds to make it sound<br>better. The Russian boy, neat in his habits, produced a pencil and a<br>small notebook and made a calculation.<br><br>'My father has over two hundred times as much money as yours,' he<br>announced with a sort of amused contempt.<br><br>That was in 1915. What happened to that money a couple of years later, I<br>wonder? And still more I wonder, do conversations of that kind happen at<br>preparatory schools now?<br><br>Clearly there has been a vast change of outlook, a general growth of<br>'enlightenment,' even among ordinary, unthinking middle-class people.<br>Religious belief, for instance, has largely vanished, dragging other<br>kinds of nonsense after it. I imagine that very few people nowadays would<br>tell a child that if it masturbates it will end in the lunatic asylum.<br>Beating, too, has become discredited, and has even been abandoned at many<br>schools. Nor is the underf ceding of children looked on as a normal,<br>almost meritorious act. No one now would openly set out to give his<br>pupils as little food as they could do with, or tell them that it is<br>healthy to get up from a meal as hungry as you sat down. The whole status<br>of children has improved, partly because they have grown relatively less<br>numerous. And the diffusion of even a little psychological knowledge has<br>made it harder for parents and schoolteachers to indulge their<br>aberrations in the name of discipline. Here is a case, not known to me<br>personally, but known to someone I can vouch for, and happening within my<br>own lifetime. A small girl, daughter of a clergyman, continued wetting<br>her bed at an age when she should have grown out of it. In order to<br>punish her for this dreadful deed, her father took her to a large garden<br>party and there introduced her to the whole company as a little girl who<br>wetted her bed: and to underline her wickedness he had previously painted<br>her face black. I do not suggest that Bingo and Sim would actually have<br>done a thing like this, but I doubt whether it would have much surprised<br>them. After all, things do change. And yet--!<br><br>The question is not whether boys are still buckled into Eton collars on<br>Sunday, or told that babies are dug up under gooseberry bushes. That kind<br>of thing is at an end, admittedly. The real question is whether it is<br>still normal for a school child to live for years amid irrational terrors<br>and lunatic misunderstandings. And here one is up against the very great<br>difficulty of knowing what a child really feels and thinks. A child which<br>appears reasonably happy may actually be suffering horrors which it<br>cannot or will not reveal. It lives in a sort of alien under-water world<br>which we can only penetrate by memory or divination. Our chief clue is<br>the fact that we were once children ourselves, and many people appear to<br>forget the atmosphere of their own childhood almost entirely. Think for<br>instance of the unnecessary torments that people will inflict by sending<br>a child back to school with clothes of the wrong pattern, and refusing to<br>see that this matters! Over things of this kind a child will sometimes<br>utter a protest, but a great deal of the time its attitude is one of<br>simple concealment. Not to expose your true feelings to an adult seems to<br>be instinctive from the age of seven or eight onwards. Even the affection<br>that one feels for a child, the desire to protect and cherish it, is a<br>cause of misunderstanding. One can love a child, perhaps, more deeply<br>than one can love another adult, but is rash to assume that the child<br>feels any love in return. Looking back on my own childhood, after the<br>infant years were over, I do not believe that I ever felt love for any<br>mature person, except my mother, and even her I did not trust, in the<br>sense that shyness made me conceal most of my real feelings from her.<br>Love, the spontaneous, unqualified emotion of love, was something I could<br>only feel for people who were young. Towards people who were old--and<br>remember that 'old' to a child means over thirty, or even over<br>twenty-five--I could feel reverence, respect, admiration or compunction,<br>but I seemed cut off from them by a veil of fear and shyness mixed up<br>with physical distaste. People are too ready to forget the child's<br>physical shrinking from the adult. The enormous size of grownups, their<br>ungainly, rigid bodies, their coarse wrinkled skins, their great relaxed<br>eyelids, their yellow teeth, and the whiffs of musty clothes and beer and<br>sweat and tobacco that disengage from them at every movement! Part of the<br>reason for the ugliness of adults, in a child's eyes, is that the child<br>is usually looking upwards, and few faces are at their best when seen<br>from below. Besides, being fresh and unmarked itself, the child has<br>impossibly high standards in the matter of skin and teeth and complexion.<br>But the greatest barrier of all is the child's misconception about age. A<br>child can hardly envisage life beyond thirty, and in judging people's<br>ages it will make fantastic mistakes. It will think that a person of<br>twenty-five is forty, that a person of forty is sixty-five, and so on.<br>Thus, when I fell in love with Elsie I took her to be grown up. I met her<br>again, when I was thirteen and she, I think, must have been twenty-three;<br>she now seemed to me a middle-aged woman, somewhat past her best. And the<br>child thinks of growing old as an almost obscene calamity, which for some<br>mysterious reason will never happen to itself. All who have passed the<br>age of thirty are joyless grotesques, endlessly fussing about things of<br>no importance and staying alive without, so far as the child can see,<br>having anything to live for. Only child life is real life. The<br>schoolmaster who imagines he is loved and trusted by his boys is in fact<br>mimicked and laughed at behind his back. An adult who does not seem<br>dangerous nearly always seems ridiculous.<br><br>I base these generalizations on what I can recall of my own childhood<br>outlook. Treacherous though memory is, it seems to me the chief means we<br>have of discovering how a child's mind works. Only by resurrecting our<br>own memories can we realize how incredibly distorted is the child's<br>vision of the world. Consider this, for example. How would Crossgates<br>appear to me now, if I could go back, at my present age, and see it as it<br>was in 1915? What should I think of Bingo and Sim, those terrible,<br>all-powerful monsters? I should see them as a couple of silly, shallow,<br>ineffectual people, eagerly clambering up a social ladder which any<br>thinking person could see to be on the point of collapse. I would be no<br>more frightened of them than I would be frightened of a dormouse.<br>Moreover, in those days they seemed to me fantastically old, whereas--<br>though of this I am not certain--I imagine they must have been somewhat<br>younger than I am now. And how would Johnny Hall appear, with his<br>blacksmith's arms and his red, jeering face? Merely a scruffy little boy,<br>barely distinguishable from hundreds of other scruffy little boys. The<br>two sets of facts can lie side by side in my mind, because these happen<br>to be my own memories. But it would be very difficult for me to see with<br>the eyes of any other child, except by an effort of the imagination which<br>might lead me completely astray. The child and the adult live in<br>different worlds. If that is so, we cannot be certain that school, at any<br>rate boarding school, is not still for many children as dreadful an<br>experience as it used to be. Take away God, Latin, the cane, class<br>distinctions and sexual taboos, and the fear, the hatred, the snobbery<br>and the misunderstanding might still all be there. It will have been seen<br>that my own main trouble was an utter lack of any sense of proportion or<br>probability. This led me to accept outrages and believe absurdities, and<br>to suffer torments over things which were in fact of no importance. It is<br>not enough to say that I was 'silly' and 'ought to have known better.'<br>Look back into your own childhood and think of the nonsense you used to<br>believe and the trivialities which could make you suffer. Of course my<br>own case had its individual variations, but essentially it was that of<br>countless other boys. The weakness of the child is that it starts with a<br>blank sheet. It neither understands nor questions the society in which it<br>lives, and because of its credulity other people can work upon it,<br>infecting it with the sense of inferiority and the dread of offending<br>against mysterious, terrible laws. It may be that everything that<br>happened to me at Crossgates could happen in the most 'enlightened'<br>school, though perhaps in subtler forms. Of one thing, however, I do feel<br>fairly sure, and that is that boarding schools are worse than day<br>schools. A child has a better chance with the sanctuary of its home near<br>at hand. And I think the characteristic faults of the English upper and<br>middle classes may be partly due to the practice, general until recently,<br>of sending children away from home as young as nine, eight or even seven.<br><br>I have never been back to Crossgates. In a way it is only within the last<br>decade that I have really thought over my schooldays, vividly though<br>their memory has haunted me. Nowadays, I believe, it would make very<br>little impression on me to see the place again, if it still exists. And<br>if I went inside and smelled again the inky, dusty smell of the big<br>schoolroom, the rosiny smell of the chapel, the stagnant smell of the<br>swimming bath and the cold reek of the lavatories, I think I should only<br>feel what one invariably feels in revisiting any scene of childhood: How<br>small everything has grown, and how terrible is the deterioration in<br>myself!<br><br></font></p>
