<h2>Chapter 3</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">When the miner comes up from the pit his face is so pale that it is<br>noticeable even through the mask of coal dust. This is due to the foul air<br>that he has been breathing, and will wear off presently. To a Southerner,<br>new to the mining districts, the spectacle of a shift of several hundred<br>miners streaming out of the pit is strange and slightly sinister. Then-<br>exhausted faces, with the grime clinging in all the hollows, have a fierce,<br>wild look. At other times, when their faces are clean, there is not much to<br>distinguish them from the rest of the population. They have a very upright<br>square-shouldered walk, a reaction from the constant bending underground,<br>but most of them are shortish men and their thick ill-fitting clothes hide<br>the splendour of their bodies. The most definitely distinctive thing about<br>them is the blue scars on their noses. Every miner has blue scars on his<br>nose and forehead, and will carry them to his death. The coal dust of which<br>the air underground is full enters every cut, and then the skin grows over<br>it and forms a blue stain like tattooing, which in fact it is. Some of the<br>older men have their foreheads veined like Roquefort cheeses from this<br>cause.<br><br>As soon as the miner comes above ground he gargles a little water to<br>get the worst of the coal dust out of his throat and nostrils, and then<br>goes home and either washes or does not wash according to his temperament.<br>From what I have seen I should say that a majority of miners prefer to eat<br>their meal first and wash afterwards, as I should do in their<br>circumstances. It is the normal thing to see a miner sitting down to his<br>tea with a Christy-minstrel face, completely black except for very red lips<br>which become clean by eating. After his meal he takes a largish basin of<br>water and washes very methodically, first his hands, then his chest, neck,<br>and armpits, then his forearms, then his face and scalp (it is on the scalp<br>that the grime clings thickest), and then his wife takes the flannel and<br>washes his back. He has only washed the top half of his body and probably<br>his navel is still a nest of coal dust, but even so it takes some skill to<br>get pass-ably clean in a single basin of water. For my own part I found I<br>needed two complete baths after going down a coal-mine. Getting the dirt<br>out of one's eyelids is a ten minutes' job in itself.<br><br>At some of the larger and better appointed collieries there are<br>pithead baths. This is an enormous advantage, for not only can the miner<br>wash himself all over every day, in comfort and even luxury, but at the<br>baths he has two lockers where he can keep his pit clothes separate from<br>his day clothes, so that within twenty minutes of emerging as black as a<br>Negro he can be riding off to a football match dressed up to the nines. But<br>it is only comparatively seldom because a seam of coal does not last for<br>ever, so that it is not necessarily worth building a bath every time a<br>shaft is sunk. I can-not get hold of exact figures, but it seems likely<br>that rather less than one miner in three has access to a pithead bath.<br>Probably a large majority of miners are completely black from the waist<br>down for at least six days a week. It is almost impossible for them to wash<br>all over in their own homes. Every drop of water has got to be heated up,<br>and in a tiny living-room which contains, apart from the kitchen range and<br>a quantity of furniture, a wife, some children, and probably a dog, there<br>is simply not room to have a proper bath. Even with a basin one is bound to<br>splash the furniture. Middle-class people are fond of saying that the<br>miners would not wash themselves properly even if they could, but this is<br>nonsense, as is shown by the fact that where pithead baths exist<br>practically all the men use them. Only among the very old men does the<br>belief still linger that washing one's legs 'causes lumbago'. Moreover the<br>pithead baths, where they exist, are paid for wholly or partly by the<br>miners themselves, out of the Miners' Welfare Fund. Sometimes the colliery<br>company subscribes, some-times the Fund bears the whole cost. But doubtless<br>even at this late date the old ladies in Brighton boarding-houses are<br>saying that 'if you give those miners baths they only use them to keep coal<br>in'.<br><br>As a matter of fact it is surprising that miners wash as regularly as<br>they do, seeing how little time they have between work and sleep. It is a<br>great mistake to think of a miner's working day as being only seven and a<br>half hours. Seven and a half hours is the time spent actually on the job,<br>but, as I have already explained, one has got to add on to this time taken<br>up in 'travelling', which is seldom less than an hour and may often be<br>three hours. In addition most miners have to spend a considerable time in<br>getting to and from the pit. Throughout the industrial districts there is<br>an acute shortage of houses, and it is only in the small mining villages,<br>where the village is grouped round the pit, that the men can be certain of<br>living near their work. In the larger mining towns where I have stayed,<br>nearly everyone went to work by bus; half a crown a week seemed to be the<br>normal amount to spend on fares. One miner I stayed with was working on the<br>morning shift, which was from six in the morning till half past one. He had<br>to be out of bed at a quarter to four and got back somewhere after three in<br>the afternoon. In another house where I stayed a boy of fifteen was working<br>on the night shift. He left for work at nine at night and got back at eight<br>in the morning, had his breakfast, and then promptly went to bed and slept<br>till six in the evening; so that his leisure time amounted to, about four<br>hours a day--actually a good deal less, if you take off the time for<br>washing, eating, and dressing.<br><br>The adjustments a miner's family have to make when he is changed from<br>one shift to another must be tiresome in the extreme. If he is on the night<br>shift he gets home in time for breakfast, on the morning shift he gets home<br>in the middle of the afternoon, and on the afternoon shift he gets home in<br>the middle of the night; and in each case, of course, he wants his<br>principal meal of the day as soon as he returns. I notice that the Rev. W.<br>R. Inge, in his book England, accuses the miners of gluttony. From my own<br>observation I should say that they eat astonishingly little. Most of the<br>miners I stayed with ate slightly less than I did. Many of them declare<br>that they cannot do their day's work if they have had a heavy meal<br>beforehand, and the food they take with them is only a snack, usually<br>bread-and-dripping and cold tea. They carry it in a flat tin called a snap-<br>can which they strap to their belts. When a miner gets back late at night<br>his wife waits up for him, but when he is on the morning shift it seems to<br>be the custom for him to get his breakfast for himself. Apparently the old<br>superstition that it is bad luck to see a woman before going to work on the<br>morning shift is not quite extinct. In the old days, it is said, a miner<br>who happened to meet a woman in the early morning would often turn back and<br>do no work that day.<br><br>Before I had been in the coal areas I shared the wide-spread illusion<br>that miners are comparatively well paid. One hears it loosely stated that a<br>miner is paid ten or eleven shillings a shift, and one does a small<br>multiplication sum and concludes that every miner is earning round about L2<br>a week or L150 a year. But the statement that a miner receives ten or<br>eleven shillings a shift is very misleading. To begin with, it is only the<br>actual coal 'getter' who is paid at this rate; a 'dataller', for instance,<br>who attends to the roofing, is paid at a lower rate, usually eight or nine<br>shillings a shift. Again, when the coal 'getter' is paid piecework, so much<br>per ton extracted, as is the case in many mines, he is dependent on the<br>quality of the coal; a breakdown in the machinery or a 'fault'--that is,<br>a streak of rock running through the coal seam--may rob him of his<br>earnings for a day or two at a time. But in any case one ought not to think<br>of the miner as working six days a week, fifty-two weeks a year. Almost<br>certainly there will be a number of days when he is' laid off'. The average<br>earning per shift worked for every mine-worker, of all ages and both sexes,<br>in Great Britain in 1934, was 9s. 1 3/4d. [From the Colliery Tear Book<br>and Coal Trades Directory for 1935.] If everyone were in work all the<br>time, this would mean that the mine-worker was earning a little over L142 a<br>year, or nearly L2 15s. a week. His real income, however, is far lower than<br>this, for the 9s. 1 3/4d. is merely an average calculation on shifts<br>actually worked and takes no account of blank days.<br><br>I have before me five pay-checks belonging to a Yorkshire miner, for<br>five weeks (not consecutive) at the beginning of 1936. Averaging them up,<br>the gross weekly wages they represent is L2 15s. 2d.; this is an average of<br>nearly 9s. 2 1/2d. a shift. But these pay-checks are for the winter, when<br>nearly all mines are running full time. As spring advances the coal trade<br>slacks off and more and more men are 'temporarily stopped', while others<br>still technically in work are laid off for a day or two in every week. It<br>is obvious therefore that L150 or even L142 is an immense over-estimate for<br>the mine-worker's yearly income. As a matter of fact, for the year 1934 the<br>average gross earnings of all miners through-out Great Britain was only<br>L115 11s. 6d. It varied consider-ably from district to district, rising as<br>high as L133 2s. 8d. in Scotland, while in Durham it was a little under<br>L105 or barely more than L2 a week. I take these figures from The Coid<br>Scuttle, by Mr Joseph Jones, Mayor of Barnsley, Yorkshire. Mr Jones adds:<br><br>These figures cover the earnings of youths as well as adults and of<br>the higher- as well as the lower-paid grades... any particularly high<br>earning would be included in these figures, as would the earnings of<br>certain officials and other higher-paid men as well as the higher amounts<br>paid for overtime work.<br><br>The figures, being averages, fail... to reveal the position of<br>thousands of adult workers whose earnings were substantially below the<br>average and' who received only 30s. to 40s. or less per week.<br><br>Mr Jones's italics. But please notice that even these wretched<br>earnings are gross earnings. On top of this there are all kinds of<br>stoppages which are deducted from the miner's wages every week. Here is a<br>list of weekly stoppages which was given me as typical in one Lancashire<br>district:<br><br>s. d.<br><br>Insurance (unemployment and health) 1 5<br>Hire of lamp 6<br>For sharpening tools 6<br>Check-weighman 9<br>Infirmary 2<br>Hospital 1<br>Benevolent Fund 6<br>Union fees 6<br>----<br>Total 4 5<br>----<br><br>Some of these stoppages, such as the Benevolent Fund and the union<br>fees, are, so to speak, the miner's own responsibility, others are imposed<br>by the colliery company. They are not the same in all districts. For<br>instance, the iniquitous swindle of making the miner pay for the hire of<br>his lamp (at sixpence a week he buys the lamp several times over in a<br>single year) does not obtain everywhere. But the stoppages always seem to<br>total up to about the same amount. On the Yorkshire miner's five pay-<br>checks, the average gross earning per week is L2 15s. 2d.; the average net<br>earning, after the stoppages have come off, is only L2 11s. 4d.--a<br>reduction of 3s. 10d. a week. But the pay-check, naturally, only mentions<br>stoppages which are imposed or paid through the colliery company; one has<br>got to add the union fees, bringing the total reduction up to something<br>over four shillings. Probably it is safe to say that stoppages of one kind<br>and another cut four shillings or thereabouts from every adult miner's<br>weekly wage. So that the L115 11s. 6d. which was the mine-worker's average<br>earning throughout Great Britain in 1934 should really be something nearer<br>L105. As against this, most miners receive allowances in kind, being able<br>to purchase coal for their own use at a reduced rate, usually eight or nine<br>shillings a ton. But according to Mr Jones, quoted above, 'the average<br>value of all allowances in kind for the country as a whole is only<br>fourpence a day'. And this fourpence a day is offset, in many cases, by the<br>amount the miner has to spend on fares in getting to and from the pit. So,<br>taking the industry as a whole, the sum the miner can actually bring home<br>and call his own does not average more, perhaps slightly less, than two<br>pounds a week.<br><br>Meanwhile, how much coal is the average miner producing?<br><br>The tonnage of coal raised yearly per person employed in mining rises<br>steadily though rather slowly. In 1914 every mine-worker produced, on<br>average, 253 tons of coal; in 1934 he produced 280 tons.[The Coal Scuttle.<br>The Colliery Yew Book end Coal Trades Directory gives a slightly higher<br>figure.] This of course is an average figure for mine-workers of all<br>kinds; those actually working at the coal face extract an enormously<br>greater amount--in many cases, probably, well over a thousand tons each.<br>But taking 280 tons as a representative figure, it is worth noticing what<br>a vast achievement this is. One gets the best idea of it by comparing<br>a miner's life with somebody else's. If I live to be sixty I shall<br>probably have produced thirty novels, or enough to fill two medium-sized<br>library shelves. In the same period the average miner produces 8400 tons<br>of coal; enough coal to pave Trafalgar Square nearly two feet deep or to<br>supply seven large families with fuel for over a hundred years.<br><br>Of the five pay-checks I mentioned above, no less than three are<br>rubber-stamped with the words 'death stoppage'. When a miner is killed at<br>work it is usual for the other miners to make up a subscription, generally<br>of a shilling each, for his widow, and this is collected by the colliery<br>company and automatically deducted from their wages. The significant detail<br>here is the rubber stamp. The rate of accidents among miners is so high,<br>compared with that in other trades, that casualties are taken for granted<br>almost as they would be in a minor war. Every year one miner in about nine<br>hundred is killed and one in about six is injured; most of these injuries,<br>of course, are petty ones, but a fair number amount to total disablement.<br>This means that if a miner's working life is forty years the chances are<br>nearly seven to one against his escaping injury and not much more than<br>twenty to one against his being killed outright. No other trade approaches<br>this in dangerousness; the next most dangerous is the shipping trade, one<br>sailor in a little under 1300 being killed every year. The figures I have<br>given apply, of course, to mine-workers as a whole; for those actually<br>working underground the proportion of injuries would be very much higher.<br>Every miner of long standing that I have talked to had either been in a<br>fairly serious accident himself or had seen some of his mates killed, and<br>in every mining family they tell you tales of fathers, brothers, or uncles<br>killed at work. ('And he fell seven hundred feet, and they wouldn't never<br>have collected t'pieces only he were wearing a new suit of oil-skins,'<br>etc., etc., etc.) Some of these tales are appalling in the extreme. One<br>miner, for instance, described to me how a mate of his, a 'dataller', was<br>buried by a fall of rock. They rushed to him and managed to uncover his<br>head and shoulders so that he could breathe, and he was alive and spoke to<br>them. Then they saw that the roof was coming down again and had to run to<br>save themselves; the 'dataller' was buried a second time. Once again they<br>rushed to him and got his head and shoulders free, and again he was alive<br>and spoke to them. Then the roof came down a third time, and this time they<br>could not uncover him for several hours, after which, of course, he was<br>dead. But the miner who told me the story (he had been buried himself on<br>one occasion, but he was lucky enough to have his head jammed between his<br>legs so that there was a small space in which he could breathe) did not<br>think it was a particularly appalling one. Its significance, for him, was<br>that the 'dataller' had known perfectly well that the place where he was<br>working was unsafe, and had gone there in daily expectation of an accident.<br>'And it worked on his mind to that extent that he got to kissing his wife<br>before he went to work. And she told me afterwards that it were over twenty<br>years since he'd kissed her.'<br><br>The most obviously understandable cause of accidents is explosions of<br>gas, which is always more or less present in the atmosphere of the pit.<br>There is a special lamp which is used to test the air for gas, and when it<br>is present in at all large quantities it can be detected by the flame of an<br>ordinary Davy lamp burning blue. If the wick can be turned up to its full<br>extent and the flame is still blue, the proportion of gas is dangerously<br>high; it is, nevertheless, difficult to detect, because it does not<br>distribute itself evenly throughout the atmosphere but hangs about in<br>cracks and crevices. Before starting work a miner often tests for gas by<br>poking his lamp into all the corners. The gas may be touched off by a spark<br>during blasting operations, or by a pick striking a spark from a stone, or<br>by a defective lamp, or by 'gob fires'--spontaneously generated fires<br>which' smoulder in the coal dust and are very hard to put out. The great<br>mining disasters which happen from time to time, in which several hundred<br>men are killed, are usually caused by explosions; hence one tends to think<br>of explosions as the chief danger of mining. Actually, the great majority<br>of accidents are due to the normal every-day dangers of the pit; in<br>particular, to falls of roof. There are, for instance, 'pot-holes'--<br>circular holes from which a lump of stone big enough to kill a man shoots<br>out with the promptitude of a bullet. With, so far as I can remember, only<br>one exception, all the miners I have talked to declared that the new<br>machinery, and 'speeding up' generally, have made the work more dangerous.<br>This may be partly due to conservatism, but they can give plenty of<br>reasons. To begin with, the speed at which the coal is now extracted means<br>that for hours at a time a dangerously large stretch of roof remains<br>unpropped. Then there is the vibration, which tends to shake everything<br>loose, and the noise, which makes it harder to detect signs of danger. One<br>must remember that a miner's safety underground depend largely on his own<br>care and skill. An experienced miner claims to know by a sort of instinct<br>when the roof is unsafe; the way he puts it is that he 'can feel the weight<br>on him'. He can, for instance, hear the faint creaking of the props. The<br>reason why wooden props are still generally preferred to iron girders is<br>that a wooden prop which is about to collapse gives warning by creaking,<br>whereas a girder flies out un-expectedly. The devastating noise of the<br>machines makes it impossible to hear anything else, and thus the danger is<br>increased.<br><br>When a miner is hurt it is of course impossible to attend to him<br>immediately. He lies crushed under several hundred-weight of stone in some<br>dreadful cranny underground, and even after he has been extricated it is<br>necessary to drag his body a mile or more, perhaps, through galleries where<br>nobody can stand upright. Usually when you talk to a man who has been<br>injured you find that it was a couple of hours or so before they got him to<br>the surface. Sometimes, of course, there are accidents to the cage. The<br>cage is shooting several yards up or down at the speed of an express train,<br>and it is operated by somebody on the surface who cannot see what is<br>happening. He has very delicate indicators to tell him how far the cage has<br>got, but it is possible for him to make a mistake, and there have been<br>cases of the cage crashing into the pit-bottom at its very maximum speed.<br>This seems to me a dreadful way to die. For as that tiny steel box whizzes<br>through the blackness there must come a moment when the ten men who are<br>locked inside it know that something has gone wrong; and the remaining<br>seconds before they are smashed to pieces hardly bear thinking about. A<br>miner told me he was once in a cage in which something went wrong. It did<br>not slow up when it should have done, and they thought the cable must have<br>snapped. As it happened they got to the bottom safely, but when he stepped<br>out he found that he had broken a tooth; he had been clenching his teeth so<br>hard in expectation of that frightful crash.<br><br>Apart from accidents miners seem to be healthy, as obviously they have<br>got to be, considering the muscular efforts demanded of them. They are<br>liable to rheumatism and a man with defective lungs does not last long in<br>that dust-impregnated air, but the most characteristic industrial disease<br>is nystagmus. This is a disease of the eyes which makes the eyeballs<br>oscillate in a strange manner when they come near a light. It is due<br>presumably to working in half-darkness, and sometimes results in total<br>blindness. Miners who are disabled in this way or any other way are<br>compensated by the colliery company, sometimes with a lump sum, sometimes<br>with a weekly pension. This pension never amounts to more than twenty-nine<br>shillings a week; if it falls below fifteen shillings the disabled man can<br>also get something from the dole or the P.A.C. If I were a disabled miner I<br>should very much prefer the lump sum, for then at any rate I should know<br>that I had got my money. Disability pensions are not guaranteed by any<br>centralized fund, so that if the colliery company goes bankrupt that is the<br>end of the disabled miner's pension, though he does figure among the other<br>creditors.<br><br>In Wigan I stayed for a while with a miner who was suffering from<br>nystagmus. He could see across the room but not much further. He had been<br>drawing compensation of twenty-nine shillings a week for the past nine<br>months, but the colliery company were now talking of putting him on<br>'partial compensation' of fourteen shillings a week. It all depended on<br>whether the doctor passed him as fit for light work 'on top'. Even if the<br>doctor did pass him there would, needless to say, be no light work<br>available, but he could draw the dole and the company would have saved<br>itself fifteen shillings a week. Watching this man go to the colliery to<br>draw his compensation, I was struck by the profound differences that are<br>still made by status. Here was a man who had been half blinded in one of<br>the most useful of all jobs and was drawing a pension to which he had a<br>perfect right, if anybody has a right to anything. Yet he could not, so to<br>speak, demand this pension--he could not, for instance, draw it when and<br>how he wanted it. He had to go to the colliery once a week at a time named<br>by the company, and when he got there he was kept waiting about for hours<br>in the cold wind. For all I know he was also expected to touch his cap and<br>show gratitude to whoever paid him; at any rate he had to waste an<br>afternoon and spend sixpence in bus fares. It is very different for a<br>member of the bourgeoisie, even such a down-at-heel member as I am. Even<br>when I am on the verge of starvation I have certain rights attaching to my<br>bourgeois status. I do not earn much more than a miner earns, but I do at<br>least get it paid into my bank in a gentle-manly manner and can draw it out<br>when I choose. And even when my account is exhausted the bank people are<br>passably polite.<br><br>This business of petty inconvenience and indignity, of being kept<br>waiting about, of having to do everything at other people's convenience, is<br>inherent in working-class life. A thousand influences constantly press a<br>working man down into a passive role. He does not act, he is acted upon. He<br>feels himself the slave of mysterious authority and has a firm conviction<br>that 'they' will never allow him to do this, that, and the other. Once when<br>I was hop-picking I asked the sweated pickers (they earn something under<br>sixpence an hour) why they did not form a union. I was told immediately<br>that 'they' would never allow it. Who were 'they'? I asked. Nobody seemed<br>to know, but evidently 'they' were omnipotent.<br><br>A person of bourgeois origin goes through life with some expectation<br>of getting what he wants, within reasonable limits. Hence the fact that in<br>times of stress 'educated' people tend to come to the front; they are no<br>more gifted than the others and their 'education' is generally quite<br>useless in itself, but they are accustomed to a certain amount of deference<br>and consequently have the cheek necessary to a commander. That they will<br>come to the front seems to be taken for granted, always and everywhere. In<br>Lissagaray's History of the Commune there is an interesting passage<br>describing the shootings that took place after the Commune had been<br>suppressed. The authorities were shooting the ringleaders, and as they did<br>not know who the ringleaders were, they were picking them out on the<br>principle that those of better class would be the ringleaders. An officer<br>walked down a line of prisoners, picking out likely-looking types. One man<br>was shot because he was wearing a watch, another because he 'had an<br>intelligent face'. I should not like to be shot for having an intelligent<br>face, but I do agree that in almost any revolt the leaders would tend to be<br>people who could pronounce their aitches.<br><br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/1.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/3.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
