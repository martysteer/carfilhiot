<h2>Chapter 2</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Our civilization, pace Chesterton, is founded on coal, more completely than<br>one realizes until one stops to think about it. The machines that keep us<br>alive, and the machines that make machines, are all directly or indirectly<br>dependent upon coal. In the metabolism of the Western world the coal-miner<br>is second in importance only to the man who ploughs the soil. He is a sort<br>of caryatid upon whose shoulders nearly everything that is not grimy is<br>supported. For this reason the actual process by which coal is extracted is<br>well worth watching, if you get the chance and are willing to take the<br>trouble.<br><br>When you go down a coal-mine it is important to try and get to the<br>coal face when the 'fillers' are at work. This is not easy, because when<br>the mine is working visitors are a nuisance and are not encouraged, but if<br>you go at any other time, it is possible to come away with a totally wrong<br>impression. On a Sunday, for instance, a mine seems almost peaceful. The<br>time to go there is when the machines are roaring and the air is black with<br>coal dust, and when you can actually see what the miners have to do. At<br>those times the place is like hell, or at any rate like my own mental<br>picture of hell. Most of the things one imagines in hell are if there--<br>heat, noise, confusion, darkness, foul air, and, above all, unbearably<br>cramped space. Everything except the fire, for there is no fire down there<br>except the feeble beams of Davy lamps and electric torches which scarcely<br>penetrate the clouds of coal dust.<br><br>When you have finally got there--and getting there is a in itself: I<br>will explain that in a moment--you crawl through the last line of pit<br>props and see opposite you a shiny black wall three or four feet high. This<br>is the coal face. Overhead is the smooth ceiling made by the rock from<br>which the coal has been cut; underneath is the rock again, so that the<br>gallery you are in is only as high as the ledge of coal itself, probably<br>not much more than a yard. The first impression of all, overmastering<br>everything else for a while, is the frightful, deafening din from the<br>conveyor belt which carries the coal away. You cannot see very far, because<br>the fog of coal dust throws back the beam of your lamp, but you can see on<br>either side of you the line of half-naked kneeling men, one to every four<br>or five yards, driving their shovels under the fallen coal and flinging it<br>swiftly over their left shoulders. They are feeding it on to the conveyor<br>belt, a moving rubber, belt a couple of feet wide which runs a yard or two<br>behind them. Down this belt a glittering river of coal races constantly. In<br>a big mine it is carrying away several tons of coal every minute. It bears<br>it off to some place in the main roads where it is shot into tubs holding<br>half a tun, and thence dragged to the cages and hoisted to the outer air.<br><br>It is impossible to watch the 'fillers' at work without feelling a<br>pang of envy for their toughness. It is a dreadful job that they do, an<br>almost superhuman job by the standard of an ordinary person. For they are<br>not only shifting monstrous quantities of coal, they are also doing, it in<br>a position that doubles or trebles the work. They have got to remain<br>kneeling all the while--they could hardly rise from their knees without<br>hitting the ceiling--and you can easily see by trying it what a<br>tremendous effort this means. Shovelling is comparatively easy when you are<br>standing up, because you can use your knee and thigh to drive the shovel<br>along; kneeling down, the whole of the strain is thrown upon your arm and<br>belly muscles. And the other conditions do not exactly make things easier.<br>There is the heat--it varies, but in some mines it is suffocating--and<br>the coal dust that stuffs up your throat and nostrils and collects along<br>your eyelids, and the unending rattle of the conveyor belt, which in that<br>confined space is rather like the rattle of a machine gun. But the fillers<br>look and work as though they were made of iron. They really do look like<br>iron hammered iron statues--under the smooth coat of coal dust which<br>clings to them from head to foot. It is only when you see miners down the<br>mine and naked that you realize what splendid men, they are. Most of them<br>are small (big men are at a disadvantage in that job) but nearly all of<br>them have the most noble bodies; wide shoulders tapering to slender supple<br>waists, and small pronounced buttocks and sinewy thighs, with not an ounce<br>of waste flesh anywhere. In the hotter mines they wear only a pair of thin<br>drawers, clogs and knee-pads; in the hottest mines of all, only the clogs<br>and knee-pads. You can hardly tell by the look of them whether they are<br>young or old. They may be any age up to sixty or even sixty-five, but when<br>they are black and naked they all look alike. No one could do their work<br>who had not a young man's body, and a figure fit for a guardsman at that,<br>just a few pounds of extra flesh on the waist-line, and the constant<br>bending would be impossible. You can never forget that spectacle once you<br>have seen it--the line of bowed, kneeling figures, sooty black all over,<br>driving their, huge shovels under the coal with stupendous force and speed.<br>They are on the job for seven and a half hours, theoretically without a<br>break, for there is no time 'off'. Actually they, snatch a quarter of an<br>hour or so at some time during the shift to eat the food they have brought<br>with them, usually a hunk of bread and dripping and a bottle of cold tea.<br>The first time I was watching the 'fillers' at work I put my hand upon some<br>dreadful slimy thing among the coal dust. It was a chewed quid of tobacco.<br>Nearly all the miners chew tobacco, which is said to be good against<br>thirst.<br><br>Probably you have to go down several coal-mines before you can get<br>much grasp of the processes that are going on round you. This is chiefly<br>because the mere effort of getting from place to place; makes it difficult<br>to notice anything else, In some ways it is even disappointing, or at least<br>is unlike what you have, expected. You get into the cage, which is a steel<br>box about as wide as a telephone box and two or three times as long. It<br>holds ten men, but they pack it like pilchards in a tin, and a tall man<br>cannot stand upright in it. The steel door shuts upon you, and somebody<br>working the winding gear above drops you into the void. You have the usual<br>momentary qualm in your belly and a bursting sensation in the cars, but not<br>much sensation of movement till you get near the bottom, when the cage<br>slows down so abruptly that you could swear it is going upwards again. In<br>the middle of the run the cage probably touches sixty miles an hour; in<br>some of the deeper mines it touches even more. When you crawl out at the<br>bottom you are perhaps four hundred yards underground. That is to say you<br>have a tolerable-sized mountain on top of you; hundreds of yards of solid<br>rock, bones of extinct beasts, subsoil, flints, roots of growing things,<br>green grass and cows grazing on it--all this suspended over your head and<br>held back only by wooden props as thick as the calf of your leg. But<br>because of the speed at which the cage has brought you down, and the<br>complete blackness through which you have travelled, you hardly feel<br>yourself deeper down than you would at the bottom of the Piccadilly tube.<br><br>What is surprising, on the other hand, is the immense horizontal<br>distances that have to be travelled underground. Before I had been down a<br>mine I had vaguely imagined the miner stepping out of the cage and getting<br>to work on a ledge of coal a few yards away. I had not realized that before<br>he even gets to work he may have had to creep along passages as long as<br>from London Bridge to Oxford Circus. In the beginning, of course, a mine<br>shaft is sunk somewhere near a seam of coal; But as that seam is worked out<br>and fresh seams are followed up, the workings get further and further from<br>the pit bottom. If it is a mile from the pit bottom to the coal face, that<br>is probably an average distance; three miles is a fairly normal one; there<br>are even said to be a few mines where it is as much as five miles. But<br>these distances bear no relation to distances above ground. For in all that<br>mile or three miles as it may be, there is hardly anywhere outside the main<br>road, and not many places even there, where a man can stand upright.<br><br>You do not notice the effect of this till you have gone a few hundred<br>yards. You start off, stooping slightly, down the dim-lit gallery, eight or<br>ten feet wide and about five high, with the walls built up with slabs of<br>shale, like the stone walls in Derbyshire. Every yard or two there are<br>wooden props holding up the beams and girders; some of the girders have<br>buckled into fantastic curves under which you have to duck. Usually it is<br>bad going underfoot--thick dust or jagged chunks of shale, and in some<br>mines where there is water it is as mucky as a farm-yard. Also there is the<br>track for the coal tubs, like a miniature railway track with sleepers a<br>foot or two apart, which is tiresome to walk on. Everything is grey with<br>shale dust; there is a dusty fiery smell which seems to be the same in all<br>mines. You see mysterious machines of which you never learn the purpose,<br>and bundles of tools slung together on wires, and sometimes mice darting<br>away from the beam of the lamps. They are surprisingly common, especially<br>in mines where there are or have been horses. It would be interesting to<br>know how they got there in the first place; possibly by falling down the<br>shaft--for they say a mouse can fall any distance uninjured, owing to its<br>surface area being so large relative to its weight. You press yourself<br>against the wall to make way for lines of tubs jolting slowly towards the<br>shaft, drawn by an endless steel cable operated from the surface. You creep<br>through sacking curtains and thick wooden doors which, when they are<br>opened, let out fierce blasts of air. These doors are an important part of<br>the ventilation system. The exhausted air is sucked out of one shaft by<br>means of fans, and the fresh air enters the other of its own accord. But if<br>left to itself the air will take the shortest way round, leaving the deeper<br>workings unventilated; so all the short cuts have to be partitioned off.<br><br>At the start to walk stooping is rather a joke, but it is a joke that<br>soon wears off. I am handicapped by being exceptionally tall, but when the<br>roof falls to four feet or less it is a tough job for anybody except a<br>dwarf or a child. You not only have to bend double, you have also got to<br>keep your head up all the while so as to see the beams and girders and<br>dodge them when they come. You have, thehefore, a constant crick in the<br>neck, but this is nothing to the pain in your knees and thighs. After half<br>a mile it becomes (I am not exaggerating) an unbearable agony. You begin to<br>wonder whether you will ever get to the end--still more, how on earth you<br>are going to get back. Your pace grows slower and slower. You come to a<br>stretch of a couple of hundred yards where it is all exceptionally low and<br>you have to work yourself along in a squatting position. Then suddenly the<br>roof opens out to a mysterious height--scene of and old fall of rock,<br>probably--and for twenty whole yards you can stand upright. The relief is<br>overwhelming. But after this there is another low stretch of a hundred<br>yards and then a succession of beams which you have to crawl under. You go<br>down on all fours; even this is a relief after the squatting business. But<br>when you come to the end of the beams and try to get up again, you find<br>that your knees have temporarily struck work and refuse to lift you. You<br>call a halt, ignominiously, and say that you would like to rest for a<br>minute or two. Your guide (a miner) is sympathetic. He knows that your<br>muscles are not the same as his. 'Only another four hundred yards,' he says<br>encouragingly; you feel that he might as well say another four hundred<br>miles. But finally you do somehow creep as far as the coal face. You have<br>gone a mile and taken the best part of an hour; a miner would do it in not<br>much more than twenty minutes. Having got there, you have to sprawl in the<br>coal dust and get your strength back for several minutes before you can<br>even watch the work in progress with any kind of intelligence.<br><br>Coming back is worse than going, not only because you are already<br>tired out but because the journey back to the shaft is slightly uphill. You<br>get through the low places at the speed of a tortoise, and you have no<br>shame now about calling a halt when your knees give way. Even the lamp you<br>are carrying becomes a nuisance and probably when you stumble you drop it;<br>whereupon, if it is a Davy lamp, it goes out. Ducking the beams becomes<br>more and more of an effort, and sometimes you forget to duck. You try<br>walking head down as the miners do, and then you bang your backbone. Even<br>the miners bang their backbones fairly often. This is the reason why in<br>very hot mines, where it is necessary to go about half naked, most of the<br>miners have what they call 'buttons down the back'--that is, a permanent<br>scab on each vertebra. When the track is down hill the miners sometimes fit<br>their clogs, which are hollow under-neath, on to the trolley rails and<br>slide down. In mines where the 'travelling' is very bad all the miners<br>carry sticks about two and a half feet long, hollowed out below the handle.<br>In normal places you keep your hand on top of the stick and in the low<br>places you slide your hand down into the hollow. These sticks are a great<br>help, and the wooden crash-helmets--a comparatively recent invention--<br>are a godsend. They look like a French or Italian steel helmet, but they<br>are made of some kind of pith and very light, and so strong, that you can<br>take a violent blow on the head without feeling it. When finally you get<br>back to the surface you have been perhaps three hours underground and<br>travelled two miles, and you, are more exhausted than you would be by a<br>twenty-five-mile walk above ground. For a week afterwards your thighs are<br>so stiff that coming downstairs is quite a difficult feat; you have to work<br>your way down in a peculiar sidelong manner, without bending the knees.<br>Your miner friends notice the stiffness of your walk and chaff you about<br>it. ('How'd ta like to work down pit, eh?' etc.) Yet even a miner who has<br>been long away front work--from illness, for instance--when he comes<br>back to the pit, suffers badly for the first few days.<br><br>It may seem that I am exaggerating, though no one who has been down an<br>old-fashioned pit (most of the pits in England are old-fashioned) and<br>actually gone as far as the coal face, is likely to say so. But what I want<br>to emphasize is this. Here is this frightful business of crawling to and<br>fro, which to any normal person is a hard day's work in itself; and it is<br>not part of the miner's work at all, it is merely an extra, like the City<br>man's daily ride in the Tube. The miner does that journey to and fro, and<br>sandwiched in between there are seven and a half hours of savage work. I<br>have never travelled much more than a mile to the coal face; but often it<br>is three miles, in which case I and most people other than coal-miners<br>would never get there at all. This is the kind of point that one is always<br>liable to miss. When you think of the coal-mine you think of depth, heat,<br>darkness, blackened figures hacking at walls of coal; you don't think,<br>necessarily, of those miles of creeping to and fro. There is the question<br>of time, also. A miner's working shift of seven and a half hours does not<br>sound very long, but one has got to add on to it at least an hour a day for<br>'travelling', more often two hours and sometimes three. Of course, the<br>'travelling' is not technically work and the miner is not paid for it; but<br>it is as like work as makes no difference. It is easy to say that miners<br>don't mind all this. Certainly, it is not the same for them as it would be<br>for you or me. They have done it since childhood, they have the right<br>muscles hardened, and they can move to and fro underground with a startling<br>and rather horrible agility. A miner puts his head down and runs, with a<br>long swinging stride, through places where I can only stagger. At the<br>workings you see them on all fours, skipping round the pit props almost<br>like dogs. But it is quite a mistake to think that they enjoy it. I have<br>talked about this to scores of miners and they all admit that the<br>'travelling' is hard work; in any case when you hear them discussing a pit<br>among themselves the 'travelling' is always one of the things they discuss.<br>It is said that a shift always returns from work faster than it goes;<br>nevertheless the miners all say that it is the coming away after a hard<br>day's work, that is especially irksome. It is part of their work and they<br>are equal to it, but certainly it is an effort. It is comparable, perhaps,<br>to climbing a smallish mountain before and after your day's work.<br><br>When you have been down in two or three pits you begin to get some<br>grasp of the processes that are going on underground. (I ought to say, by<br>the way, that I know nothing whatever about the technical side of mining: I<br>am merely describing what I have seen.) Coal lies in thin seams between<br>enormous layers of rock, so that essentially the process of getting it out<br>is like scooping the central layer from a Neapolitan ice. In the old days<br>the miners used to cut straight into the coal with pick and crowbar--a<br>very slow job because coal, when lying in its virgin state, is almost as<br>hard as rock. Nowadays the preliminary work is done by an electrically-<br>driven coal-cutter, which in principle is an immensely tough and powerful<br>band-saw, running horizontally instead of vertically, with teeth a couple<br>of inches long and half an inch or an inch thick. It can move backwards or<br>forwards on its own power, and the men operating it can rotate it this way<br>or that. Incidentally it makes one of the most awful noises I have ever<br>heard, and sends forth clouds of coal dust which make it impossible to see<br>more than two to three feet and almost impossible to breathe. The machine<br>travels along the coal face cutting into the base of the coal and<br>undermining it to the depth of five feet or five feet and a half; after<br>this it is comparatively easy to extract the coal to the depth to which it<br>has been undermined. Where it is 'difficult getting', however, it has also<br>to be loosened with explosives. A man with an electric drill, like a rather<br>small version of the drills used in street-mending, bores holes at<br>intervals in the coal, inserts blasting powder, plugs it with clay, goes<br>round the corner if there is one handy (he is supposed to retire to twenty-<br>five yards distance) and touches off the charge with an electric current.<br>This is not intended to bring the coal out, only to loosen it.<br>Occasionally, of course, the charge is too powerful, and then it not only<br>brings the coal out but brings the roof down as well.<br><br>After the blasting has been done the 'fillers' can tumble the coal<br>out, break it up and shovel it on to the conveyor belt. It comes out first<br>in monstrous boulders which may weigh anything up to twenty tons. The<br>conveyor belt shoots it on to tubs, and the tubs are shoved into the main<br>road and hitched on to an endlessly revolving steel cable which drags them<br>to the cage. Then they are hoisted, and at the surface the coal is sorted<br>by being run over screens, and if necessary is washed as well. As far as<br>possible the 'dirt'--the shale, that is--is used for making the roads<br>below. All what cannot be used is sent to the surface and dumped; hence the<br>monstrous 'dirt-heaps', like hideous grey mountains, which are the<br>characteristic scenery of the coal areas. When the coal has been extracted<br>to the depth to which the machine has cut, the coal face has advanced by<br>five feet. Fresh props are put in to hold up the newly exposed roof, and<br>during the next shift the conveyor belt is taken to pieces, moved five feet<br>forward and re-assembled. As far as possible the three operations of<br>cutting, blasting and extraction are done in three separate shifts, the<br>cutting in the afternoon, the blasting at night (there is a law, not always<br>kept, that forbids its being done when other men are working near by), and<br>the 'filling' in the morning shift, which lasts from six in the morning<br>until half past one.<br><br>Even when you watch the process of coal-extraction you probably only<br>watch it for a short time, and it is not until you begin making a few<br>calculations that you realize what a stupendous task the 'fillers' are<br>performing. Normally each o man has to clear a space four or five yards<br>wide. The cutter has undermined the coal to the depth of five feet, so that<br>if the seam of coal is three or four feet high, each man has to cut out,<br>break up and load on to the belt something between seven and twelve cubic<br>yards of coal. This is to say, taking a cubic yard as weighing twenty-seven<br>hundred-weight, that each man is shifting coal at a speed approaching two<br>tons an hour. I have just enough experience of pick and shovel work to be<br>able to grasp what this means. When I am digging trenches in my garden, if<br>I shift two tons of earth during the afternoon, I feel that I have earned<br>my tea. But earth is tractable stuff compared with coal, and I don't have<br>to work kneeling down, a thousand feet underground, in suffocating heat and<br>swallowing coal dust with every breath I take; nor do I have to walk a mile<br>bent double before I begin. The miner's job would be as much beyond my<br>power as it would be to perform on a flying trapeze or to win the Grand<br>National. I am not a manual labourer and please God I never shall be one,<br>but there are some kinds of manual work that I could do if I had to. At a<br>pitch I could be a tolerable road-sweeper or an inefficient gardener or<br>even a tenth-rate farm hand. But by no conceivable amount of effort or<br>training could I become a coal-miner, the work would kill me in a few<br>weeks.<br><br>Watching coal-miners at work, you realize momentarily what different<br>universes people inhabit. Down there where coal is dug is a sort of world<br>apart which one can quite easily go through life without ever hearing<br>about. Probably majority of people would even prefer not to hear about it.<br>Yet it is the absolutely necessary counterpart of our world above.<br>Practically everything we do, from eating an ice to crossing the Atlantic,<br>and from baking a loaf to writing a novel, involves the use of coal,<br>directly or indirectly. For all the arts of peace coal is needed; if war<br>breaks out it is needed all the more. In time of revolution the miner must<br>go on working or the revolution must stop, for revolution as much as<br>reaction needs coal. Whatever may be happening on the surface, the hacking<br>and shovelling have got to continue without a pause, or at any rate without<br>pausing for more than a few weeks at the most. In order that Hitler may<br>march the goose-step, that the Pope may denounce Bolshevism, that the<br>cricket crowds may assemble at Lords, that the poets may scratch one<br>another's backs, coal has got to be forthcoming. But on the whole we are<br>not aware of it; we all know that we 'must have coal', but we seldom or<br>never remember what coal-getting involves. Here am I sitting writing in<br>front of my comfortable coal fire. It is April but I still need a fire.<br>Once a fortnight the coal cart drives up to the door and men in leather<br>jerkins carry the coal indoors in stout sacks smelling of tar and shoot it<br>clanking into the coal-hole under the stairs. It is only very rarely, when<br>I make a definite mental-effort, that I connect this coal with that far-off<br>labour in the mines. It is just 'coal'--something that I have got to<br>have; black stuff that arrives mysteriously from nowhere in particular,<br>like manna except that you have to pay for it. You could quite easily drive<br>a car right across the north of England and never once remember that<br>hundreds of feet below the road you are on the miners are hacking at the<br>coal. Yet in a sense it is the miners who are driving your car forward.<br>Their lamp-lit world down there is as necessary to the daylight world above<br>as the root is to the flower.<br><br>It is not long since conditions in the mines were worse than they are<br>now. There are still living a few very old women who in their youth have<br>worked underground, with the harness round their waists, and a chain that<br>passed between their legs, crawling on all fours and dragging tubs of coal.<br>They used to go on doing this even when they were pregnant. And even now,<br>if coal could not be produced without pregnant women dragging it to and<br>fro, I fancy we should let them do it rather than deprive ourselves of<br>coal. But-most of the time, of course, we should prefer to forget that they<br>were doing it. It is so with all types of manual work; it keeps us alive,<br>and we are oblivious of its existence. More than anyone else, perhaps, the<br>miner can stand as the type of the manual worker, not only because his work<br>is so exaggeratedly awful, but also because it is so vitally necessary and<br>yet so remote from our experience, so invisible, as it were, that we are<br>capable of forgetting it as we forget the blood in our veins. In a way it<br>is even humiliating to watch coal-miners working. It raises in you a<br>momentary doubt about your own status as an 'intellectual' and a superior<br>person generally. For it is brought home to you, at least while you are<br>watching, that it is only because miners sweat their guts out that superior<br>persons can remain superior. You and I and the editor of the Times Lit.<br>Supp., and the poets and the Archbishop of Canterbury and Comrade X, author<br>of Marxism for Infants--all of us really owe the comparative decency of<br>our lives to poor drudges underground, blackened to the eyes, with their<br>throats full of coal dust, driving their shovels forward with arms and<br>belly muscles of steel. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/0.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/2.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
