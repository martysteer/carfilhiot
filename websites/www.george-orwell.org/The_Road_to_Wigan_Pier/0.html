<h2>Chapter 1</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The first sound in the mornings was the clumping of the mill-girls' clogs<br>down the cobbled street. Earlier than that, I suppose, there were factory<br>whistles which I was never awake to hear.<br><br>My bed was in the right-hand corner on the side nearest the door.<br>There was another bed across the foot of it and jammed hard against it (it<br>had to be in that position to allow the door to open) so that I had to<br>sleep with my legs doubled up; if I straightened them out I kicked the<br>occupant of the other bed in the small of the back. He was an elderly man<br>named Mr Reilly, a mechanic of sorts and employed 'on top' at one of the<br>coal pits. Luckily he had to go to work at five in the morning, so I could<br>uncoil my legs and have a couple of hours' proper sleep after he was gone.<br>In the bed opposite there was a Scotch miner who had been injured in a pit<br>accident (a huge chunk of stone pinned him to the ground and it was a<br>couple of hours before they could lever it off), and had received five<br>hundred pounds compensation. He was a big handsome man of forty, with<br>grizzled hair and a clipped moustache, more like a sergeant-major than a<br>miner, and he would lie in bed till late in the day, smoking a short pipe.<br>The other bed was occupied by a succession of commercial travellers,<br>newspaper-canvassers, and hire-purchase touts who generally stayed for a<br>couple of nights. It was a double bed and much the best in the room. I had<br>slept in it myself my first night there, but had been manoeuvred out of it<br>to make room for another lodger. I believe all newcomers spent their first<br>night in the double bed, which was used, so to speak, as bait. All the<br>windows were kept tight shut, with a red sandbag jammed in the bottom, and<br>in the morning the room stank like a ferret's cage. You did not notice it<br>when you got up, but if you went out of the room and came back, the smell<br>hit you in the face with a smack.<br><br>I never discovered how many bedrooms the house contained, but strange<br>to say there was a bathroom, dating from before the Brookers' time.<br>Downstairs there was the usual kitchen living-room with its huge open range<br>burning night and day. It was lighted only by a skylight, for on one side<br>of it was the shop and on the other the larder, which opened into some dark<br>subterranean place where the tripe was stored. Partly blocking the door of<br>the larder there was a shapeless sofa upon which Mrs Brooker, our landlady,<br>lay permanently ill, festooned in grimy blankets. She had a big, pale<br>yellow, anxious face. No one knew for certain what was the matter with her;<br>I suspect that her only real trouble was over-eating. In front of the fire<br>there was almost always a line of damp washing, and in the middle of the<br>room was the big kitchen table at which the family and all the lodgers ate.<br>I never saw this table completely uncovered, but I saw its various<br>wrappings at different times. At the bottom there was a layer of old<br>newspaper stained by Worcester Sauce; above that a sheet of sticky white<br>oil-cloth; above that a green serge cloth; above that a coarse linen cloth,<br>never changed and seldom taken off. Generally the crumbs from breakfast<br>were still on the table at supper. I used to get to know individual crumbs<br>by sight and watch their progress up and down the table from day to day.<br><br>The shop was a narrow, cold sort of room. On the. outside of the<br>window a few white letters, relics of ancient chocolate advertisements,<br>were scattered like stars. Inside there was a slab upon which lay the great<br>white folds of tripe, and the grey flocculent stuff known as 'black tripe',<br>and the ghostly translucent feet of pigs, ready boiled. It was the ordinary<br>'tripe and pea' shop, and not much else was stocked except bread,<br>cigarettes, and tinned stuff. 'Teas' were advertised in the window, but if<br>a customer demanded a cup of tea he was usually put off with excuses. Mr<br>Brooker, though out of work for two years, was a miner by trade, but he and<br>his wife had been keeping shops of various kinds as a side-line all their<br>lives. At one time they had had a pub, but they had lost their licence for<br>allowing gambling on the premises. I doubt whether any of their businesses<br>had ever paid; they were the kind of people who run a business chiefly in<br>order to have something to grumble about. Mr Brooker was a dark, small-<br>boned, sour, Irish-looking man, and astonishingly dirty. I don't think I<br>ever once saw his hands clean. As Mrs Brooker was now an invalid he<br>prepared most of the food, and like all people with permanently dirty hands<br>he had a peculiarly intimate, lingering manner of handling things. If he<br>gave you a slice of bread-and-butter there was always a black thumb-print<br>on it. Even in the early morning when he descended into the mysterious den<br>behind Mrs Brooker's sofa and fished out the tripe, his hands were already<br>black. I heard dreadful stories from the other lodgers about the place<br>where the tripe was kept. Blackbeetles were said to swarm there. I do not<br>know how often fresh consignments of tripe were ordered, but it was at long<br>intervals, for Mrs Brooker used to date events by it. 'Let me see now, I've<br>had in three lots of froze (frozen tripe) since that happened,' etc. We<br>lodgers were never given tripe to eat. At the time I imagined that this<br>was because tripe was too expensive; I have since thought that it was<br>merely because we knew too much about it. The Brookers never ate tripe<br>themselves, I noticed.<br><br>The only permanent lodgers were the Scotch miner, Mr Reilly, two old-<br>age pensioners, and an unemployed man on the P.A.C. named Joe--he was the<br>kind of person who has no surname. The Scotch miner was a bore when you got<br>to know him. Like so many unemployed men he spent too much time reading<br>newspapers, and if you did not head him off he would discourse for hours<br>about such things as the Yellow Peril, trunk murders, astrology, and the<br>conflict between religion and science. The old-age pensioners had, as<br>usual, been driven from their homes by the Means Test. They handed their<br>weekly ten shillings over to the Brookers and in return got the kind of<br>accommodation you would expect for ten shillings; that is, a bed in the<br>attic and meals chiefly of bread-and-butter. One of them was of'superior'<br>type and was dying of some malignant disease--cancer, I believe. He only<br>got out of bed on the days when he went to draw his pension. The other,<br>called by everyone Old Jack, was an ex-miner aged seventy-eight who had<br>worked well over fifty years in the pits. He was alert and intelligent, but<br>curiously enough he seemed only to remember his boyhood experiences and to<br>have forgotten all about the modem mining machinery and improvements. He<br>used to tell me tales of fights with savage horses in the narrow galleries<br>underground. When he heard that I was arranging to go down several coal<br>mines he was contemptuous and declared that a man of my size (six feet two<br>and a half) would never manage the 'travelling'; it was no use telling him<br>that the 'travelling' was better than it used to be. But he was friendly to<br>everyone and used to give us all a fine shout of 'Good night, boys!' as he<br>crawled up the stairs to his bed somewhere under the rafters. What I most<br>admired about Old Jack was that he never cadged; he was generally out-of<br>tobacco towards the end of the week, but he always refused to smoke anyone<br>else's. The Brookers had insured the lives of both old-age pensioners with<br>one of the tanner-a-week companies. It was said that they were overheard<br>anxiously asking the insurance-tout 'how long people lives when they've got<br>cancer'.<br><br>Joe, like the Scotchman, was a great reader of newspapers and spent<br>almost his entire day in the public library. He was the typical unmarried<br>unemployed man, a derelict-looking, frankly ragged creature with a round,<br>almost childish face on which there was a naively naughty expression. He<br>looked more like a neglected little boy than a grown-up man. I suppose it<br>is the complete lack of responsibility that makes so many of these men look<br>younger than their ages. From Joe's appearance I took him to be about<br>twenty-eight, and was amazed to learn that he was forty-three. He had a<br>love of resounding phrases and was very proud of the astuteness with which<br>he had avoided getting married. He often said to me, 'Matrimonial chains is<br>a big item,' evidently feeling this to be a very subtle and portentous<br>remark. His total income was fifteen shillings a week, and he paid out six<br>or seven to the Brookers for his bed. I sometimes used to see him making<br>himself a cup of tea over the kitchen fire, but for the rest he got his<br>meals somewhere out of doors; it was mostly slices of bread-and-marg and<br>packets of fish and chips, I suppose.<br><br>Besides these there was a floating clientele of commercial travellers<br>of the poorer sort, travelling actors--always common in the North because<br>most of the larger pubs hire variety artists at the week-ends--and<br>newspaper-canvassers. The newspaper-canvassers were a type I had never met<br>before. Their job seemed to me so hopeless, so appalling that I wondered<br>how anyone could put up with such a thing when prison was a possible<br>alternative. They were employed mostly by weekly or Sunday papers, and they<br>were sent from town to town, provided with maps and given a list of streets<br>which they had to 'work' each day. If they failed to secure a minimum of<br>twenty orders a day, they got the sack. So long as they kept up their<br>twenty orders a day they received a small salary--two pounds a week, I<br>think; on any order over the twenty they drew a tiny commission. The thing<br>is not so impossible as it sounds, because in working-class districts every<br>family takes in a twopenny weekly paper and changes it every few weeks; but<br>I doubt whether anyone keeps a job of that kind long. The newspapers engage<br>poor desperate wretches, out-of-work clerks and commercial travellers and<br>the like, who for a while make frantic efforts and keep their sales up to<br>the minimum; then as the deadly work wears them down they are sacked and<br>fresh men are taken on. I got to know two who were employed by one of the<br>more notorious weeklies. Both of them were middle-aged men with families to<br>support, and one of them was a grandfather. They were on their feet ten<br>hours a day, 'working' their appointed streets, and then busy late into the<br>night filling in blank forms for some swindle their paper was running--<br>one of those schemes by which you are 'given' a set of crockery if you take<br>out a six weeks' subscription and send a two-shilling postal order as well.<br>The fat one, the grandfather, used to fall asleep with his head on a pile<br>of forms. Neither of them could afford the pound a week which the Brookers<br>charged for full board. They used to pay a small sum for their beds and<br>make shamefaced meals in a corner of the kitchen off bacon and bread-and-<br>margarine which they stored in their suit-cases.<br><br>The Brookers had large numbers of sons and daughters, most of whom had<br>long since fled from home. Some were in Canada 'at Canada', as Mrs Brooker<br>used to put it. There was only one son living near by, a large pig-like<br>young man employed in a garage, who frequently came to the house for his<br>meals. His wife was there all day with the two children, and most of the<br>cooking and laundering was done by her and by Emmie, the fiancee of another<br>son who was in London. Emmie was a fair-haired, sharp-nosed, unhappy-<br>looking girl who worked at one of the mills for some starvation wage, but<br>nevertheless spent all her evenings in bondage at the Brookers' house. I<br>gathered that the marriage was constantly being postponed and would<br>probably never take place, but Mrs Brooker had already appropriated Emmie<br>as a daughter-in-law, and nagged her in that peculiar watchful, loving way<br>that invalids have. The rest of the housework was done, or not done, by Mr<br>Brooker. Mrs Brooker seldom rose from her sofa in the kitchen (she spent<br>the night there as well as the day) and was too ill to do anything except<br>eat stupendous meals. It was Mr Brooker who attended to the shop, gave the<br>lodgers their food, and 'did out' the bedrooms. He was always moving with<br>incredible slowness from one hated job to another. Often the beds were<br>still unmade at six in the evening, and at any hour of the day you were<br>liable to meet Mr Brooker on the stairs, carrying a full chamber-pot which<br>he gripped with his thumb well over the rim. In the mornings he sat by the<br>fire with a tub of filthy water, peeling potatoes at the speed of a slow-<br>motion picture. I never saw anyone who could peel potatoes with quite such<br>an air of brooding resentment. You could see the hatred of this 'bloody<br>woman's work', as he called it, fermenting inside him, a kind of bitter<br>juice. He was one of those people who can chew their grievances like a cud.<br><br>Of course, as I was indoors a good deal, I heard all about the<br>Brookers' woes, and how everyone swindled them and was ungrateful to them,<br>and how the shop did not pay and the lodging-house hardly paid. By local<br>standards they were not so badly off, for, in some way I did not<br>understand, Mr Brooker was dodging the Means Test and drawing an allowance<br>from the P.A.C., but their chief pleasure was talking about their<br>grievances to anyone who would listen. Mrs Brooker used to lament by the<br>hour, lying on her sofa, a soft mound of fat and self-pity, saying the same<br>things over and over again.' We don't seem to get no customers nowadays. I<br>don't know 'ow it is. The tripe's just a-laying there day after day--such<br>beautiful tripe it is, too! It does seem 'ard, don't it now ?' etc., etc.,<br>etc. All Mrs Brookers' laments ended with' It does seem 'ard, don't it now?'<br>like the refrain of a ballade. Certainly it was true that the shop did<br>not pay. The whole place had the unmistakable dusty, flyblown air of a<br>business that is going down. But it would have been quite useless to<br>explain to them why nobody came to the shop, even if one had had the face<br>to do it; neither was capable of understanding that last year's dead<br>bluebottles supine in the shop window are not good for trade.<br><br>But the thing that really tormented them was the thought of those two<br>old-age pensioners living in their house, usurping floor-space, devouring<br>food, and paying only ten shillings a week. I doubt whether they were<br>really losing money over the old-age pensioners, though certainly the<br>profit on ten shillings a week must have been very small. But in their eyes<br>the two old men were a kind of dreadful parasite who had fastened on them<br>and were living on their charity. Old Jack they could just tolerate,<br>because he kept out-of-doors most of the day, but they really hated the<br>bedridden one, Hooker by name. Mr Brooker had a queer way of pronouncing<br>his name, without the H and with a long U--'Uker'. What tales I heard<br>about old Hooker and his fractiousness, the nuisance of making his bed, the<br>way he 'wouldn't eat' this and 'wouldn't eat' that, his endless ingratitude<br>and, above all, the selfish obstinacy with which he refused to die! The<br>Brookers were quite openly pining for him to die. When that happened they<br>could at least draw the insurance money. They seemed to feel him there,<br>eating their substance day after day, as though he had been a living worm<br>in their bowels. Sometimes Mr Brooker would look up from his potato-<br>peeling, catch my eye, and jerk his head with a look of inexpressible<br>bitterness towards the ceiling, towards old Hooker's room. 'It's a b-,<br>ain't it?' he would say. There was no need to say more; I had heard all<br>about old Hooker's ways already. But the Brookers had grievances of one<br>kind and another against all their lodgers, myself included, no doubt. Joe,<br>being on the P.A.C., was practically in the same category as the old-age<br>pensioners. The Scotchman paid a pound a week, but he was indoors most of<br>the day and they 'didn't like him always hanging round the place', as they<br>put it. The newspaper-canvassers were out all day, but the Brookers bore<br>them a grudge for bringing in their own food, and even Mr Reilly, their<br>best lodger, was in disgrace because Mrs Brooker said that he woke her up<br>when he came downstairs in the mornings. They couldn't, they complained<br>perpetually, get the kind of lodgers they wanted--good-class 'commercial<br>gentlemen' who paid full board and were out all day. Their ideal lodger<br>would have been somebody who paid thirty shillings a week and never came<br>indoors except to sleep. I have noticed that people who let lodgings nearly<br>always hate their lodgers. They want their money but they look on them as<br>intruders and have a curiously watchful, jealous attitude which at bottom<br>is a determination not to let the lodger make himself too much at home. It<br>is an inevitable result of the bad system by which the lodger has to live<br>in somebody else's house without being one of the family.<br><br>The meals at the Brookers' house were uniformly disgusting. For<br>breakfast you got two rashers of bacon and a pale fried egg, and bread-and-<br>butter which had often been cut overnight and always had thumb-marks on it.<br>However tactfully I tried, I could never induce Mr Brooker to let me cut my<br>own bread-and-butter; he would hand it to me slice by slice, each slice<br>gripped firmly under that broad black thumbs For dinner there were<br>generally those threepenny steak puddings which are sold ready-made in<br>tins--these were part of the stock of the shop, I think--and boiled<br>potatoes and rice pudding. For tea there was more bread-and-butter and<br>frayed-looking sweet cakes which were probably bought as 'stales' from the<br>baker. For supper there was the pale flabby Lancashire cheese and biscuits.<br>The Brookers never called these biscuits biscuits. They always referred to<br>them reverently as 'cream crackers'--'Have another cream cracker, Mr Reilly.<br>You'll like a cream cracker with your cheese'--thus glozing over the fact<br>that there was only cheese for supper. Several bottles of Worcester Sauce<br>and a half-full jar of marmalade lived permanently on the table. It was<br>usual to souse everything, even a piece of cheese, with Worcester Sauce,<br>but I never saw anyone brave the marmalade jar, which was an unspeakable<br>mass of stickiness and dust. Mrs Brooker had her meals separately but also<br>took snacks from any meal that happened to be going, and manoeuvred with<br>great skill for what she called 'the bottom of the pot', meaning the<br>strongest cup of tea. She had a habit of constantly wiping her mouth on one<br>of her blankets. Towards the end of my stay she took to tearing off strips<br>of newspaper for this purpose, and in the morning the floor was often<br>littered with crumpled-up balls of slimy paper which lay there for hours.<br>The smell of the kitchen was dreadful, but, as with that of the bedroom,<br>you ceased to notice it after a while.<br><br>It struck me that this place must be fairly normal as lodging-houses<br>in the industrial areas go, for on the whole the lodgers did not complain.<br>The only one who ever did so to my knowledge was a little black-haired,<br>sharp-nosed Cockney, a traveller for a cigarette firm. He had never been in<br>the North before, and I think that till recently he had been in better<br>employ and was used to staying in commercial hotels. This was his first<br>glimpse of really low-class lodgings, the kind of place in which the poor<br>tribe of touts and canvassers have to shelter upon their endless journeys.<br>In the morning as we were dressing (he had slept in the double bed, of<br>course) I saw him look round the desolate room with a sort of wondering<br>aversion. He caught my eye and suddenly divined that I was a fellow-<br>Southerner. 'The filthy bloody bastards!' he said feelingly. After that he<br>packed his suit-case, went downstairs and, with great strength of mind,<br>told the Brookers that this was not the kind of house he was accustomed to<br>and that he was leaving immediately. The Brookers could never understand<br>why. They were astonished and hurt. The ingratitude of it! Leaving them<br>like that for no reason after a single night! Afterwards they discussed it<br>over and over again, in all its bearings. It was added to their store of<br>grievances.<br><br>On the day when there was a full chamber-pot under the breakfast table<br>I decided to leave. The place was beginning to depress me. It was not only<br>the dirt, the smells, and the vile food, but the feeling of stagnant<br>meaningless decay, of having got down into some subterranean place where<br>people go creeping round and round, just like blackbeetles, in an endless<br>muddle of slovened jobs and mean grievances. The most dreadful thing about<br>people like the Brookers is the way they say the same things over and over<br>again. It gives you the feeling that they are not real people at all, but a<br>kind of ghost for ever rehearsing the same futile rigmarole. In the end Mrs<br>Brooker's self-pitying talk--always the same complaints, over and over,<br>and always ending with the tremulous whine of 'It does seem 'ard, don't it<br>now?'--revolted me even more than her habit of wiping her mouth with bits<br>of newspaper. But it is no use saying that people like the Brookers are<br>just disgusting and trying to put them out of mind. For they exist in tens<br>and hundreds of thousands; they are one of the characteristic by-products<br>of the modern world. You cannot disregard them if you accept the<br>civilization that produced them. For this is part at least of what<br>industrialism has done for us. Columbus sailed the Atlantic, the first<br>steam engines tottered into motion, the British squares stood firm under<br>the French guns at Waterloo, the one-eyed scoundrels of the nineteenth<br>century praised God and filled their pockets; and this is where it all led<br>--to labyrinthine slums and dark back kitchens with sickly, ageing people<br>creeping round and round them like blackbeetles. It is a kind of duty to<br>see and smell such places now and again, especially smell them, lest you<br>should forget that they exist; though perhaps it is better not to stay<br>there too long.<br><br>The train bore me away, through the monstrous scenery of slag-heaps,<br>chimneys, piled scrap-iron, foul canals, paths of cindery mud criss-crossed<br>by the prints of clogs. This was March, but the weather had been horribly<br>cold and everywhere there were mounds of blackened snow. As we moved slowly<br>through the outskirts of the town we passed row after row of little grey<br>slum houses running at right angles to the-embankment. At the back of one<br>of the houses a young woman was kneeling on the stones, poking a stick up<br>the leaden waste-pipe which ran from the sink inside and which I suppose<br>was blocked. I had time to see everything about her--her sacking apron,<br>her clumsy clogs, her arms reddened by the cold. She looked up as the train<br>passed, and I was almost near enough to catch her eye. She had a round pale<br>face, the usual exhausted face of the slum girl who is twenty-five and<br>looks forty, thanks to miscarriages and drudgery; and it wore, for the<br>second in which I saw it, the most desolate, hopeless expression I have<br>ever-seen. It struck me then that we are mistaken when we say that' It<br>isn't the same for them as it would be for us,' and that people bred in the<br>slums can imagine nothing but the slums. For what I saw in her face was not<br>the ignorant suffering of an animal. She knew well enough what was<br>happening to her--understood as well as I did how dreadful a destiny it<br>was to be kneeling there in the bitter cold, on the slimy stones of a slum<br>backyard, poking a stick up a foul drain-pipe.<br><br>But quite soon the train drew away into open country, and that seemed<br>strange, almost unnatural, as though the open country had been a kind of<br>park; for in the industrial areas one always feels that the smoke and filth<br>must go on for ever and that no part of the earth's surface can escape<br>them. In a crowded, dirty little country like ours one takes defilement<br>almost for granted. Slag-heaps and chimneys seem a more normal, probable<br>landscape than grass and trees, and even in the depths of the country when<br>you drive your fork into the ground you half expect to lever up a broken<br>bottle or a rusty can. But out here the snow was untrodden and lay so deep<br>that only the tops of the stone boundary-walls were showing, winding over<br>the hills like black paths. I remembered that D. H. Lawrence, writing of<br>this same landscape or another near by, said that the snow-covered hills<br>rippled away into the distance 'like muscle'. It was not the simile that<br>would have occurred to me. To my eye the snow and the black walls were more<br>like a white dress with black piping running across it.<br><br>Although the snow was hardly broken the sun was shining brightly, and<br>behind the shut windows of the carriage it seemed warm. According to the<br>almanac this was spring, and a few of the birds seemed to believe it. For<br>the first time in my life, in a bare patch beside the line, I saw rooks<br>treading. They did it on the ground and not, as I should have expected, in<br>a tree. The manner of courtship was curious. The female stood with her beak<br>open and the male walked round her and appeared to be feeding her. I had<br>hardly been in the train half an hour, but it seemed a very long way from<br>the Brookers' back-kitchen to the empty slopes of snow, the bright<br>sunshine, and the big gleaming birds.<br><br>The whole of the industrial districts are really one enormous town, of<br>about the same population as Greater London but, fortunately, of much<br>larger area; so that even in the middle of them there is still room for<br>patches of cleanness and decency. That is an encouraging thought. In spite<br>of hard trying, man has not yet succeeded in doing his dirt everywhere. The<br>earth is so vast and still so empty that even in the filthy heart of<br>civilization you find fields where the grass is green instead of grey;<br>perhaps if you looked for them you might even find streams with live fish<br>in them instead of salmon tins. For quite a long time, perhaps another<br>twenty minutes, the train was rolling through open country before the<br>villa-civilization began to close in upon us again, and then the outer<br>slums, and then the slag-heaps, belching chimneys, blast-furnaces, canals,<br>and gaso-meters of another industrial town. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/1.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
