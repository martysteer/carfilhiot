<h2>Chapter 6</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">When I was a small boy at school a lecturer used to come once a term and<br>deliver excellent lectures on famous battles of the past, such as Blenheim,<br>Austerlitz, etc. He was fond of quoting Napoleon's maxim 'An army marches<br>on its stomach', and at the end of his lecture he would suddenly turn to us<br>and demand, 'What's the most important thing in the world?' We were<br>expected to shout 'Food!' and if we did not do so he was disappointed.<br><br>Obviously he was right in a way. A human being is primarily a bag for<br>putting food into; the other functions and faculties may be more godlike,<br>but in point of time they come afterwards. A man dies and is buried, and<br>all his words and actions are forgotten, but the food he has eaten lives<br>after him in the sound or rotten bones of his children. I think it could be<br>plausibly argued that changes of diet are more important than changes of<br>dynasty or even of religion. The Great War, for instance, could never have<br>happened if tinned food had not been invented. And the history of the past<br>four hundred years in England would have been immensely different if it had<br>not been for the introduction of root-crops and various other vegetables at<br>the end of the Middle Ages, and a little later the introduction of non-<br>alcoholic drinks (tea, coffee, cocoa) and also of distilled liquors to<br>which the beer-drinking English were not accustomed. Yet it is curious how<br>seldom the all-importance of food is recognized. You see statues everywhere<br>to politicians, poets, bishops, but none to cooks or bacon-curers or<br>market-gardeners. The Emperor Charles V is said to have erected a statue to<br>the inventor of bloaters, but that is the only case I can think of at the<br>moment.<br><br>So perhaps the really important thing about the unemployed, the really<br>basic thing if you look to the future, is the diet they are living on. As I<br>said earlier, the average unemployed family lives on an income of round<br>about thirty shillings a week, of which at least a quarter goes in rent. It<br>is worth considering in some detail how the remaining money is spent. I<br>have here a budget which was made out for me by an unemployed miner and his<br>wife. I asked them to make a list which represented as exactly as possible<br>their expenditure in a typical week. This man's allowance was thirty-two<br>shillings a week, and besides his wife he had two children, one aged two<br>years and five months and the other ten months. Here is the list:<br><br><br>s. d.<br><br>Rent 9 0 1/2<br>Clothing Club 3 0<br>Coal 2 0<br>Gas 1 3<br>Milk 0 10 1/2<br>Union Fees 0 3<br>Insurance (on the children) 0 2<br>Meat 2 6<br>Flour (2 stone) 3 4<br>Yeast 0 4<br>Potatoes 1 0<br>Dripping 0 10<br>Margarine 0 10<br>Bacon 1 2<br>Sugar 1 9<br>Tea 1 0<br>Jam 0 7 1/2<br>Peas and cabbage 0 6<br>Carrots and onions 0 4<br>Quaker oats 0 4 1/2<br>Soap, powders, blue, etc. 0 10<br>--------<br>Total L1 12 0<br>-------<br><br><br>In addition to this, three packets of dried milk were sup-plied weekly<br>for the baby by the Infants' Welfare Clinic. One or two comments are needed<br>here. To begin with the list leaves out a great deal--blacking, pepper,<br>salt, vinegar, matches, kindling-wood, raeor blades, replacements of<br>utensils, and wear and tear of furniture and bedding, to name the first few<br>that come to mind. Any money spent on these would mean reduction on some<br>other item. A more serious charge is tobacco. This man happened to be a<br>small smoker, but even so his tobacco would hardly cost less than a<br>shilling a week, meaning a further reduction on food. The 'clothing clubs'<br>into which unemployed people pay so much a week are run by big drapers in<br>all the industrial towns. Without them it would be impossible for<br>unemployed people to buy new clothes at all. I don't know whether or not<br>they buy bedding through these clubs. This particular family, as I happen<br>to know, possessed next to no bedding.<br><br>In the above list, if you allow a shilling for tobacco and deduct this<br>and the other non-food items, you are left with sixteen and fivepence<br>halfpenny. Call it sixteen shillings and leave the baby out of account--<br>for the baby was getting its weekly packets of milk from the Welfare<br>Clinic. This sixteen shillings has got to provide the entire nourishment,<br>including fuel, of three persons, two of them adult. The first question is<br>whether it is even theoretically possible for three persons to be properly<br>nourished on sixteen shillings a week. When the dispute over the Means Test<br>was in progress there was a disgusting public wrangle about the minimum<br>weekly sum on which a human being could keep alive. So far as I remember,<br>one school of dietitians worked it out at five and ninepence, while another<br>school, more generous, put it at five and ninepence halfpenny. After this<br>there were letters to the papers from a number of people who claimed to be<br>feeding themselves on four shillings a week. Here is a weekly budget (it<br>was printed in the New Statesman and also in the News of the World) which I<br>picked out from among a number of others:<br><br><br>s. d.<br><br>3 wholemeal loaves 1 0<br>1/2 lb. margarine 0 2 1/2<br>1/2 lb. dripping 0 3<br>1 lb. cheese 0 7<br>1 lb. onions 0 1 1/2<br>1 lb. carrots 0 1 1/2<br>1 lb. broken biscuits 0 4<br>2 lb. dates 0 6<br>1 tin evaporated milk 0 5<br>10 oranges 0 5<br>----<br>Total 3 11 1/2<br>----<br><br><br>Please notice that this budget contains nothing for fuel. In fact, the<br>writer explicitly stated that he could not afford to buy fuel and ate all<br>his food raw. Whether the letter was genuine or a hoax does not matter at<br>the moment. What I think will be admitted is that this list represents<br>about as wise an expenditure as could be contrived; if you had to live on<br>three and elevenpence halfpenny a week, you could hardly extract more food-<br>value from it than that. So perhaps it is possible to feed yourself<br>adequately on the P.A.C. allowance if you concentrate on essential<br>foodstuffs; but not otherwise.<br><br>Now compare this list with the unemployed miner's budget that I gave<br>earlier. The miner's family spend only tenpence a week on green vegetables<br>and tenpence half-penny on milk (remember that one of them is a child less<br>than three years old), and nothing on fruit; but they spend one and nine on<br>sugar (about eight pounds of sugar, that is) and a shilling on tea. The<br>half-crown spent on meat might represent a small joint and the materials<br>for a stew; probably as often as not it would represent four or five tins<br>of bully beef. The basis of their diet, therefore, is white bread and<br>margarine, corned beef, sugared tea, and potatoes--an appalling diet.<br>Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like<br>oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even, like the writer of the letter<br>to the New Statesman, saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it<br>would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do<br>such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on<br>brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less<br>money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A<br>millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an<br>unemployed man doesn't. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of<br>the last chapter comes into play. When you are unemployed, which is to say<br>when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don't want to<br>eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit 'tasty'. There is<br>always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you. Let's have three pennorth<br>of chips! Run out and buy us a twopenny ice-cream! Put the kettle on and<br>we'll all have a nice cup of tea! That is how your mind works when you are<br>at the P.A.C. level. White bread-and-marg and sugared tea don't nourish you<br>to any extent, but they are nicer (at least most people think so) than<br>brown bread-and-dripping and cold water. Unemployment is an endless misery<br>that has got to be constantly palliated, and especially with tea, the<br>English-man's opium. A cup of tea or even an aspirin is much better as a<br>temporary stimulant than a crust of brown bread.<br><br>The results of all this are visible in a physical degeneracy which you<br>can study directly, by using your eyes, or inferentially, by having a look<br>at the vital statistics. The physical average in the industrial towns is<br>terribly low, lower even than in London. In Sheffield you have the feeling<br>of walking among a population of troglodytes. The miners are splendid men,<br>but they are usually small, and the mere fact that their muscles are<br>toughened by constant work does not mean that their children start life<br>with a better physique. In any case the miners are physically the pick of<br>the population. The most obvious sign of under-nourishment is the badness<br>of everybody's teeth. In Lancashire you would have to look for a long time<br>before you saw a working-class person with good natural teeth. Indeed, you<br>see very few people with natural teeth at all, apart from the children; and<br>even the children's teeth have a frail bluish appearance which means, I<br>suppose, calcium deficiency. Several dentists have told me that in<br>industrial districts a person over thirty with any of his or her own teeth<br>is coming to be an abnormality. In Wigan various people gave me their<br>opinion that it is best to get shut of your teeth as early in life as<br>possible. 'Teeth is just a misery,' one woman said to me. In one house<br>where I stayed there were, apart from myself, five people, the oldest being<br>forty-three and the youngest a boy of fifteen. Of these the boy was the<br>only one who possessed a single tooth of his own, and his teeth were<br>obviously not going to last long. As for the vital statistics, the fact<br>that in any large industrial town the death rate and infant mortality of<br>the poorest quarters are always about double those of the well-to-do<br>residential quarters--a good deal more than double in some cases--<br>hardly needs commenting on.<br><br>Of course one ought not to imagine that the prevailing bad physique is<br>due solely to unemployment, for it is probable that the physical average<br>has been declining all over England for a long time past, and not merely<br>among the unemployed in the industrial areas. This cannot be proved<br>statistically, but it is a conclusion that is forced upon you if you use<br>your eyes, even in rural places and even in a prosperous town like London.<br>On the day when King George V's body passed through London on its way to<br>Westminster, I happened to be caught for an hour or two in the crowd in<br>Trafalgar Square. It was impossible, looking about one then, not to be<br>struck by the physical degeneracy of modern England. The people surrounding<br>me were not working-class people for the most part; they were the<br>shopkeeper--commercial-traveller type, with a sprinkling of the well-to-<br>do. But what a set they looked! Puny limbs, sickly faces, under the weeping<br>London sky! Hardly a well-built man or a decent-looking woman, and not a<br>fresh complexion anywhere. As the King's coffin went by, the men took off<br>their hats, and a friend who was in the crowd at the other side of the<br>Strand said to me afterwards, 'The only touch of colour anywhere was the<br>bald heads.' Even the Guards, it seemed to me--there was a squad of<br>guardsmen marching beside the coffin--were not what they used to be.<br>Where are the monstrous men with chests like barrels and moustaches like<br>the wings of eagles who strode across my child-hood's gaze twenty or thirty<br>years ago? Buried, I suppose, in the Flanders mud. In their place there are<br>these pale-faced boys who have been picked for their height and<br>consequently look like hop-poles in overcoats--the truth being that in<br>modern England a man over six feet high is usually skin and bone and not<br>much else. If the English physique has declined, this is no doubt partly<br>due to the fact that the Great War carefully selected the million best men<br>in England and slaughtered them, largely before they had had time to breed.<br>But the process must have begun earlier than that, and it must be due<br>ultimately to un-healthy ways of living, i.e. to industrialism. I don't<br>mean 'the habit of living in towns--probably the town is healthier than<br>the country, in many ways--but the modern industrial technique which<br>provides you with cheap substitutes for everything. We may find in the long<br>run that tinned food is a deadlier weapon than the machine gun.<br><br>It is unfortunate that the English working class--the English nation<br>generally, for that matter--are exception-ally ignorant about and<br>wasteful of food. I have pointed out elsewhere how civilized is a French<br>navvy's idea of a meal compared with an Englishman's, and I cannot believe<br>that you would ever see such wastage in a French house as you habitually<br>see in English ones. Of course, in the very poorest homes, where everybody<br>is unemployed, you don't see much actual waste, but those who can afford to<br>waste food often do so. I could give startling instances of this. Even the<br>Northern habit of baking one's own bread is slightly wasteful in itself,<br>because an overworked woman cannot bake more than once or, at most, twice a<br>week and it is impossible to tell beforehand how much bread will be wasted,<br>so that a certain amount generally has to be thrown away. The usual thing<br>is to bake six large loaves and twelve small ones at a time. All this is<br>part of the old, generous English attitude to life, and it is an amiable<br>quality, but a disastrous one at the present moment.<br><br>English working people everywhere, so far as I know, refuse brown<br>bread; it is usually impossible to buy whole-meal bread in a working-class<br>district. They sometimes give the reason that brown bread is 'dirty'. I<br>suspect the real reason is that in the past brown bread has been confused<br>with black bread, which is traditionally associated with Popery and wooden<br>shoes. (They have plenty of Popery and wooden shoes in Lancashire. A pity<br>they haven't the black bread as well!) But the English palate, especially<br>the working-class palate, now rejects good food almost automatically. The<br>number of people who prefer tinned peas and tinned fish to real peas and<br>real fish must be increasing every year, and plenty of people who could<br>afford real milk in their tea would much sooner have tinned milk--even<br>that dreadful tinned milk which is made of sugar and corn-flour and has<br>UNFIT FOR BABIES on the tin in huge letters. In some districts efforts are<br>now being made to teach the unemployed more about food-values and more<br>about the intelligent spending of money. When you hear of a thing like this<br>you feel yourself torn both ways. I have heard a Communist speaker on the<br>platform grow very angry about it. In London, he said, parties of Society<br>dames now have the cheek to walk into East End houses and give shopping-<br>lessons to the wives of the unemployed. He gave this as an instance of the<br>mentality of the English governing class. First you condemn a family to<br>live on thirty shillings a week, and then you have the damned impertinence<br>to tell them how they are to spend their money. He was quite right--I<br>agree heartily. Yet all the same it is a pity that, merely for the lack of<br>a proper tradition, people should pour muck like tinned milk down their<br>throats and not even know that it is inferior to the product of the cow.<br><br>I doubt, however, whether the unemployed would ultimately benefit if<br>they learned to spend their money more economically. For it is only the<br>fact that they are not economical that keeps their allowances so high. An<br>English-man on the P.A.C. gets fifteen shillings a week because fifteen<br>shillings is the smallest sum on which he can conceivably keep alive. If he<br>were, say, an Indian or Japanese coolie, who can live on rice and onions,<br>he wouldn't get fifteen shillings a week--he would be lucky if he got<br>fifteen shillings a month. Our unemployment allowances, miser-able though<br>they are, are framed to suit a population with very high standards and not<br>much notion of economy. If the unemployed learned to be better managers<br>they would be visibly better off, and I fancy it would not be long before<br>the dole was docked correspondingly.<br><br>There is one great mitigation of unemployment in the North, and that<br>is the cheapness of fuel. Anywhere in the coal areas the retail price of<br>coal is about one and sixpence a hundredweight; in the South of England it<br>is about half a crown. Moreover, miners in work can usually buy coal direct<br>from the pit at eight or nine shillings a ton, and those who have a cellar<br>in their homes sometimes store a ton and sell it (illicitly, I suppose) to<br>those who are out of work. But apart from this there is immense and<br>systematic thieving of coal by the unemployed. I call it thieving because<br>technically it is that, though it does no harm to anybody. In the 'dirt'<br>that is sent up from the pits there is a certain amount of broken coal, and<br>unemployed people spend a lot of time in picking it out of the slag-heaps.<br>All day long over those strange grey mountains you see people wandering to<br>and fro with sacks and baskets across the sulphurous smoke (many slag-heaps<br>are on fire under the surface), prising out the tiny nuggets of coal which<br>are buried here and there. You meet men coming away, wheeling strange and<br>wonderful home-made bicycles--bicycles made of rusty parts picked off<br>refuse-tips, without saddles, without chains and almost always without<br>tyres--across which are slung bags containing perhaps half a<br>hundredweight of coal, fruit of half a day's searching. In times of<br>strikes, when everybody is short of fuel, the miners turn out with pick and<br>shovel and burrow into the slag-heaps, whence the hummocky appearance which<br>most slag-heaps have. During long strikes, in places where there are<br>outcrops of coal, they have sunk surface mines and carried them scores of<br>yards into the earth.<br><br>In Wigan the competition among unemployed people for the waste coal<br>has become so fierce that it has led to an extraordinary custom called'<br>scrambling for the coal', which is well worth seeing. Indeed I rather<br>wonder that it has never been filmed. An unemployed miner took me to see it<br>one afternoon. We got to the place, a mountain range of ancient slag-heaps<br>with a railway running through the valley below. A couple of hundred ragged<br>men, each with a sack and coal-hammer strapped under his coat-tails, were<br>waiting on the 'broo'. When the dirt comes up-from the pit it is loaded on<br>to trucks and an engine runs these to the top of another slag-heap a<br>quarter of a mile away and there leaves them. The process of 'scrambling<br>for the coal' consists in getting on to the train while it is moving; any<br>truck which you have succeeded in boarding while it is in motion counts as<br>'your' truck. Presently the train hove in sight. With a wild yell a hundred<br>men dashed down the slope to catch her as she rounded the bend. Even at the<br>bend the train was making twenty miles an hour. The men hurled themselves<br>upon it, caught hold of the rings at the rear of the trucks and hoisted<br>themselves up by way of the bumpers, five or ten of them on each truck. The<br>driver took no notice, He drove up to the top of the slag-heap, uncoupled<br>the trucks, and ran the engine back to the pit, presently returning with a<br>fresh string of trucks. There was the same wild rush of ragged figures as<br>before. In the end only about fifty men had failed to get on to either<br>train.<br><br>We walked up to the top of the slag-heap. The men were shovelling the<br>dirt out of the trucks, while down below their wives and children were<br>kneeling, swiftly scrabbling with their hands in the damp dirt and picking<br>out lumps of coal the size of an egg or smaller. You would see a woman<br>pounce on a tiny fragment of stuff, wipe it on her apron, scrutinize it to<br>make sure it was coal, and pop it jealously into her sack. Of course, when<br>you are boarding a truck you don't know beforehand what is in it; it may be<br>actual 'dirt' from the roads or it may merely be shale from the roofing. If<br>it is a shale truck there will be no coal in it, but there occurs among the<br>shale another inflammable rock called cannel, which looks very like<br>ordinary shale but is slightly darker and is known by splitting in parallel<br>lines, like slate. It makes tolerable fuel, not good enough to be<br>commercially valuable, but good enough to be eagerly sought after by the<br>unemployed. The miners on the shale trucks were picking out the cannel and<br>splitting it up with their hammers. Down at the bottom of the 'broo' the<br>people who had failed to get on to either train were gleaning the tiny<br>chips of coal that came rolling down from above--fragments no bigger than<br>a hazel-nut, these, but the people were glad enough to get them.<br><br>We stayed there till the train was empty. In a couple of hours the<br>people had picked the dirt over to the last grain. They slung their sacks<br>over shoulder or bicycle, and started on the two-mile trudge back to Wigan.<br>Most of the families had gathered about half a hundredweight of coal or<br>carmel, so that between them they must have stolen five or ten tons of<br>fuel. This business of robbing the dirt trains takes place every day in<br>Wigan, at any rate in winter, and at more collieries than one. It is of<br>course extremely dangerous. No one was hurt the afternoon I was there, but<br>a man had had both his legs cut off a few weeks earlier, and another man<br>lost several fingers a week later. Technically it is stealing but, as<br>everybody knows, if the coal were not stolen it would simply be wasted. Now<br>and again, for form's sake, the colliery companies prosecute somebody for<br>coal-picking, and in that morning's issue of the local paper there was a<br>paragraph saying that two men had been fined ten shillings. But no notice<br>is taken of the prosecutions--in fact, one of the men named in the paper<br>was there that afternoon--and the coal-pickers subscribe among themselves<br>to pay the fines. The thing is taken for granted. Everyone knows that the<br>unemployed have got to get fuel somehow. So every afternoon several hundred<br>men risk their necks and several hundred women scrabble in the mud for<br>hours--and all for half a hundredweight of inferior fuel, value ninepence.<br><br>That scene stays in my mind as one of my pictures of Lancashire: the<br>dumpy, shawled women, with their sacking aprons and their heavy black<br>clogs, kneeling in the cindery mud and the bitter wind, searching eagerly<br>for tiny chips of coal. They are glad enough to do it. In winter they are<br>desperate for fuel; it is more important almost than food. Meanwhile all<br>round, as far as the eye can see, are the slag-heaps and hoisting gear of<br>collieries, and not one of those collieries can sell all the coal it is<br>capable of producing. This ought to appeal to Major Douglas. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/4.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/6.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
