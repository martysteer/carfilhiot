<h2>Chapter 8</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The road from Mandalay to Wigan is a long one and the reasons for taking it<br>are not immediately clear.<br><br>In the earlier chapters of this book I have given a rather fragmentary<br>account of various things I saw in the coal areas of Lancashire and<br>Yorkshire. I went there partly because I wanted to see what mass-<br>unemployment is like at its worst, partly in order to see the most typical<br>section of the English working class at close quarters. This was necessary<br>to me as part of my approach to Socialism, for before you can be sure<br>whether you are genuinely in favour of Socialism, you have got to decide<br>whether things at present are tolerable or not tolerable, and you have got<br>to take up a definite attitude on the terribly difficult issue of class.<br>Here I shall have to digress and explain how my own attitude towards the<br>class question was developed. Obviously this involves writing a certain<br>amount of autobiography, and I would not do it if I did not think that I am<br>sufficiently typical of my class, or rather sub-caste, to have a certain<br>symptomatic importance.<br><br>I was born into what you might describe as the lower-upper-middle<br>class. The upper-middle class, which had its heyday in the eighties and<br>nineties, with Kipling as its poet laureate, was a sort of mound of<br>wreckage left behind when the tide of Victorian prosperity receded. Or<br>perhaps it would be better to change the metaphor and describe it not as a<br>mound but as a layer--the layer of society lying between L2000 and L300 a<br>year: my own family was not far from the bottom. You notice that I define<br>it in terms of money, because that is always the quickest way of making<br>yourself understood. Nevertheless, the essential point about the English<br>class-system is that it is not entirely explicable in terms of money.<br>Roughly speaking it is a money-stratification, but it is also<br>interpenetrated by a sort of shadowy caste-system; rather like a jerrybuilt<br>modem bungalow haunted by medieval ghosts. Hence the fact that the upper-<br>middle class extends or extended to incomes as low as L300 a year--to<br>incomes, that is, much lower than those of merely middle-class people with<br>no social pretensions. Probably there are countries where you can predict a<br>man's opinions from his income, but it is never quite safe to do so in<br>England; you have always got to take his traditions into consideration as<br>well. A naval officer and his grocer very likely have the same income, but<br>they are not equivalent persons and they would only be on the same side in<br>very large issues such as a war or a general strike--possibly not even<br>then.<br><br>Of course it is obvious now that the upper-middle class is done for.<br>In every country town in Southern England, not to mention the dreary wastes<br>of Kensington and Earl's Court, those who knew it in the days of its glory<br>are dying, vaguely embittered by a world which has not behaved as it ought.<br>I never open one of Kipling's books or go into one of the huge dull shops<br>which were once the favourite haunt of the upper-middle class, without<br>thinking 'Change and decay in all around I see'. But before the war the<br>upper-middle class, though already none too prosperous, still felt sure of<br>itself. Before the war you were either a gentleman or not a gentleman, and<br>if you were a gentleman you struggled to behave as such, whatever your<br>income might be. Between those with L400 a year and those with L2000 or<br>even L1000 a year there was a great gulf fixed, but it was a gulf which<br>those with L400 a year did their best to ignore. Probably the<br>distinguishing mark of the upper-middle class was that its traditions were<br>not to any extent commercial, but mainly military, official, and<br>professional.<br><br>People in this class owned no land, but they felt that they were<br>landowners in the sight of God and kept up a semi-aristocratic outlook by<br>going into the professions and the fighting services rather than into<br>trade. Small boys used to count the plum stones on their plates and<br>foretell their destiny by chanting, 'Army, Navy, Church, Medicine, Law';<br>and even of these 'Medicine' was faintly inferior to the others and only<br>put in for the sake of symmetry. To belong to this class when you were at<br>the L400 a year level was a queer business, for it meant that your<br>gentility was almost purely theoretical. You lived, so to speak, at two<br>levels simultaneously. Theoretically you knew all about servants and how to<br>tip them, although in practice you had one, at most, two resident servants.<br>Theoretically you knew how to wear your clothes and how to order a dinner,<br>although in practice you could never afford to go to a decent tailor or a<br>decent restaurant. Theoretically you knew how to shoot and ride, although<br>in practice you had no horses to ride and not an inch of ground to shoot<br>over. It was this that explained the attraction of India (more recently<br>Kenya, Nigeria, etc.) for the lower-upper-middle class. The people who went<br>there as soldiers and officials did not go there to make money, for a<br>soldier or an official does not want money; they went there because in<br>India, with cheap horses, free shooting, and hordes of black servants, it<br>was so easy to play at being a gentleman.<br><br>In the kind of shabby-genteel family that I am talking about there is<br>far more consciousness of poverty than in any working-class family above<br>the level of the dole. Rent and clothes and school-bills are an unending<br>nightmare, and every luxury, even a glass of beer, is an unwarrantable<br>extravagance. Practically the whole family income goes in keeping up<br>appearances. It is obvious that people of this kind are in an anomalous<br>position, and one might 'be tempted to write them off as mere exceptions<br>and therefore unimportant. Actually, however, they are or were fairly<br>numerous. Most clergymen and schoolmasters, for instance, nearly all Anglo-<br>Indian officials, a sprinkling of soldiers and sailors, and a fair number<br>of professional men and artists, fall into this category. But the real<br>importance of this class is that they are the shock-absorbers of the<br>bourgeoisie. The real bourgeoisie, those in the L2000 a year class and<br>over, have their money as a thick layer of padding between themselves and<br>the class they plunder; in so far as they are aware of the Lower Orders at<br>all they are aware of them as employees, servants, and tradesmen. But it is<br>quite different for the poor devils lower down who are struggling to live<br>genteel lives on what are virtually working-class incomes. These last are<br>forced into close and, in a sense, intimate contact with the working class,<br>and I suspect it is from them that the traditional upper-class attitude<br>towards 'common' people is derived.<br><br>And what is this attitude? An attitude of sniggering superiority<br>punctuated by bursts of vicious hatred. Look at any number of Punch during<br>the. past thirty years. You will find it everywhere taken for granted that<br>a working-class person, as such, is a figure of fun, except at odd moments<br>when he shows signs of being too prosperous, whereupon he ceases to be a<br>figure of fun and becomes a demon. It is no use wasting breath in<br>denouncing this attitude. It is better to consider how it has arisen, and<br>to do that one has got to realize what the working classes look like to<br>those who live among them but have different habits and traditions.<br><br>A shabby genteel family is in much the same position as a family of<br>'poor whites' living in a street where everyone else is a Negro. In such<br>circumstances you have got to cling to your gentility because it is the<br>only thing you have; and meanwhile you are hated for your stuck-up-ness and<br>for the accent and manners which stamp you as one of the boss class. I was<br>very young, not much more than six, when I first became aware of class-<br>distinctions. Before that age my chief heroes had generally been working-<br>class people, because they always seemed to do such interesting things,<br>such as being fishermen and blacksmiths and bricklayers. I remember the<br>farm hands on a farm in Cornwall who used to let me ride on the drill when<br>they were sowing turnips and would sometimes catch the ewes and milk them<br>to give me a drink; and the workmen building the new house next door, who<br>let me play with the wet mortar and from whom I first learned the word<br>'b----'; and the plumber up the road with whose children I used to go out<br>bird-nesting. But it was not long before I was forbidden to play with the<br>plumber's children; they were 'common' and I was told to keep away from<br>them. This was snobbish, if you like, but it was also necessary, for<br>middle-class people can-not afford to let their children grow up with<br>vulgar accents. So, very early, the working class ceased to be a race of<br>friendly and wonderful beings and became a race of enemies. We realized<br>that they hated us, but we could never understand why, and naturally we set<br>it down to pure, vicious malignity. To me in my early boyhood, to nearly<br>all children of families like mine, 'common' people seemed almost sub-<br>human. They had coarse faces, hideous accents, and gross manners, they<br>hated everyone who was not like themselves, and if they got half a chance<br>they would insult you in brutal ways. That was our view of them, and though<br>it was false it was understandable. For one must remember that before the<br>war there was much more overt class-hatred in England than there is now. In<br>those days you were quite likely to be insulted simply for looking like a<br>member of the upper classes; nowadays, on the other hand, you are more<br>likely to be fawned upon. Anyone over thirty can remember the time when it<br>was impossible for a well-dressed person to walk through a slum street<br>without being hooted at. Whole quarters of big towns were considered unsafe<br>because of' hooligans' (now almost an extinct type), and the London gutter-<br>boy everywhere, with his loud voice and lack of intellectual scruples,<br>could make life a misery for people who considered it beneath their dignity<br>to answer back. A recurrent terror of my holidays, when I was a small boy,<br>was the gangs of' cads' who were liable to set upon you five or ten to one.<br>In term time, on the other hand, it was we who were in the majority and the<br>'cads' who were oppressed; I remember a couple of savage mass-battles in<br>the cold winter of 1916-17. And this tradition of open hostility between<br>upper and lower class had apparently been the same for at least a century<br>past. A typical joke in Punch in the sixties is a picture of a small,<br>nervous-looking gentleman riding through a slum street and a crowd of<br>street-boys closing in on him with shouts ''Ere comes a swell! Let's<br>frighten 'is 'oss!' Just fancy the street boys trying to frighten his horse<br>now! They would be much likelier to hang round him in vague hopes of a tip.<br>During the past dozen years the English working class have grown servile<br>with a rather horrifying rapidity. It was bound to happen, for the<br>frightful weapon of unemployment has cowed them. Before the war their<br>economic position was comparatively strong, for though there was no dole to<br>fall back upon, there was not much unemployment, and the power of the boss<br>class was not so obvious as it is now. A man did not see ruin staring him<br>in the face every time he cheeked a 'toff', and naturally he did cheek a<br>'toff' whenever it seemed safe to do so. G. J. Renier, in his book on Oscar<br>Wilde, points out that the strange, obscene burst of popular fury which<br>followed the Wilde trial was essentially social in character. The 'London<br>mob had caught a member of the upper classes on the hop, and they took care<br>to keep him hopping. All this was natural and even proper. If you treat<br>people as the English working class have been treated during the past two<br>centuries, you must expect them to resent it. On the other hand the<br>children of shabby-genteel families could not be blamed if they grew up<br>with a hatred of the working class, typified for them by prowling gangs of<br>'cads'.<br><br>But there was another and more serious difficulty. Here you come to<br>the real secret of class distinctions in the West--the real reason why a<br>European of bourgeois upbringing, even when he calls himself a Communist,<br>cannot without a hard effort think of a working man as his equal. It is<br>summed up in four frightful words which people nowadays are chary of<br>uttering, but which were bandied about quite freely in my childhood. The<br>words were: The lower classes smell.<br><br>That was what we were taught--the lower classes smell. And here,<br>obviously, you are at an impassable barrier. For no feeling of like or<br>dislike is quite so fundamental as a physical feeling. Race-hatred,<br>religious hatred, differences of education, of temperament, of intellect,<br>even differences of moral code, can be got over; but physical repulsion<br>can-not. You can have an affection for a murderer or a sodomite, but you<br>cannot have an affection for a man whose breath stinks--habitually<br>stinks, I mean. However well you may wish him, however much you may admire<br>his mind and character, if his breath stinks he is horrible and in your<br>heart of hearts you will hate him. It may not greatly matter if the average<br>middle-class person is brought up to believe that the working classes are<br>ignorant, lazy, drunken, boorish, and dishonest; it is when he is brought<br>up to believe that they are dirty that the harm is done. And in my<br>childhood we were brought up to believe that they were dirty. Very early in<br>life you acquired the idea that there was something subtly repulsive about<br>a working-class body; you would not get nearer to it than you could help.<br>You watched a great sweaty navvy walking down the road with his pick over<br>his shoulder; you looked at his discoloured shirt and his corduroy trousers<br>stiff with the dirt of a decade; you thought of those nests and layers of<br>greasy rags below, and, under all, the unwashed body, brown all over (that<br>was how I used to imagine it), with its strong, bacon-like reek. You<br>watched a tramp taking off his boots in a ditch--ugh! It did not<br>seriously occur to you that the tramp might not enjoy having black feet.<br>And even 'lower-class' people whom you knew to be quite clean--servants,<br>for instance--were faintly unappetizing. The smell of their sweat, the<br>very texture of their skins, were mysteriously different from yours.<br><br>Everyone who has grown up pronouncing his aitches and in a house with<br>a bathroom and one servant is likely to have grown up with these feelings;<br>hence the chasmic, impassable quality of class-distinctions in the West. It<br>is queer how seldom this is admitted. At the moment I can think of only one<br>book where it is set forth without humbug, and that is Mr Somerset<br>Maugham's On a Chinese Screen. Mr Maugham describes a high Chinese official<br>arriving at a wayside inn and blustering and calling everybody names in<br>order to impress upon them that he is a supreme dignitary and they are only<br>worms. Five minutes later, having asserted his dignity in the way he thinks<br>proper, he is eating his dinner in perfect amity with the baggage coolies.<br>As an official he feels that he has got to make his presence felt, but he<br>has no feeling that the coolies are of different clay from himself. I have<br>observed countless similar scenes in Burma. Among Mongolians--among all<br>Asiatics, for all I know--there is a sort of natural equality, an easy<br>intimacy between man and man, which is simply unthinkable in the West. Mr<br>Maugham adds:<br><br><br>In the West we are divided from our fellows by our sense of smell.<br>The working man is our master, inclined to rule us with an iron hand, but<br>it cannot be denied that he stinks: none can wonder at it, for a bath in<br>the dawn when you have to hurry to your work before the factory bell rings<br>is no pleasant thing, nor 'does heavy labour tend to sweetness; and you do<br>not change your linen more than you can help when the week's washing must<br>be done by a sharp-tongued wife. I do not blame the working man because he<br>stinks, but stink he does. It makes social intercourse difficult to persons<br>of sensitive nostril. The matutinal tub divides the classes more<br>effectually than birth, wealth, or education.<br><br><br>Meanwhile, do the 'lower classes' smell? Of course, as a whole, they<br>are dirtier than the upper classes. They are bound to be, considering the<br>circumstances in which they live, for even at this late date less than half<br>the houses in England have bathrooms. Besides, the habit of washing<br>yourself all over every day is a very recent one in Europe, and the working<br>classes are generally more conservative than the bourgeoisie. But the<br>English are growing visibly cleaner, and we may hope that in a hundred<br>years they will be almost as clean as the Japanese. It is a pity that those<br>who idealize the working class so often think it necessary to praise every<br>working-class characteristic and therefore to pretend that dirtiness is<br>somehow meritorious in itself. Here, curiously enough, the Socialist and<br>the sentimental democratic Catholic of the type of Chesterton sometimes<br>join hands; both will tell you that dirtiness is healthy and 'natural' and<br>cleanliness is a mere fad or at best a luxury.[According to Chesterton,<br>dirtiness is merely a kind of 'discomfort' and therefore ranks as<br>self-mortification. Unfortunately, the discomfort of dirtiness is chiefly<br>suffered by other people. It is not really very uncomfortable to be<br>dirty--not nearly so uncomfortable as having a cold bath on a winter<br>morning.] They seem not to see that they are merely giving colour<br>to the notion that working-class people are dirty from choice and<br>not from necessity. Actually, people who have access to a bath will<br>generally use it. But the essential thing is that middle-class people<br>believe that the working class are dirty--you see from the passage<br>quoted above that Mr Maugham himself believes it--and, what is<br>worse, that they are some-how inherently dirty. As a child, one of the most<br>dreadful things I could imagine was to drink out of a bottle after a navvy.<br>Once when I was thirteen, I was in a train coming from a market town, and<br>the third-class carriage was packed full of shepherds and pig-men who had<br>been selling their beasts. Somebody produced a quart bottle of beer and<br>passed it round; it travelled from mouth to mouth to mouth, everyone taking<br>a swig. I cannot describe the horror I felt as that bottle worked its way<br>towards me. If I drank from it after all those lower-class male mouths I<br>felt certain I should vomit; on the other hand, if they offered it to me I<br>dared not refuse for fear of offending them--you see here how the middle-<br>class squeamishness works both ways. Nowadays, thank God, I have no<br>feelings of that kind. A working man's body, as such, is no more repulsive<br>to me than a millionaire's. I still don't like drinking out of a cup or<br>bottle after another person--another man, I mean; with women I don't mind<br>--but at. least the question of class does not enter. It was rubbing<br>shoulders with the tramps that cured me of it. Tramps are not really very<br>dirty as English people go, but they have the name for being dirty, and<br>when you have shared a bed with a tramp and drunk tea out of the same<br>snufftin, you feel that you have seen the worst and the worst has no<br>terrors for you.<br><br>I have dwelt on these subjects because they are vitally important. To<br>get rid of class-distinctions you have got to start by understanding how<br>one class appears when seen through the eyes of another. It is useless to<br>say that the middle classes are 'snobbish' and leave it at that. You get no<br>further if you do not realize that snobbishness is bound up with a species<br>of idealism. It derives from the early training in which a middle-class<br>child is taught almost simultaneously to wash his neck, to be ready to die<br>for his country, and to despise the 'lower classes'.<br><br>Here I shall be accused of being behind the times, for I was a child<br>before and during the war and it may be claimed that children nowadays are<br>brought up with more enlightened notions. It is probably true that class-<br>feeling is for the moment a very little less bitter than it was. The<br>working class are submissive where they used to be openly hostile, and the<br>post-war manufacture of cheap clothes and the general softening of manners<br>have toned down the surface differences between class and class. But<br>undoubtedly the essential feeling is still there. Every middle-class person<br>has a dormant class-prejudice which needs only a small thing to arouse it;<br>and if he is over forty he probably has a firm conviction that his own<br>class has been sacrificed to the class below. Suggest to the average<br>unthinking person of gentle birth who is struggling to keep up appearances<br>on four or five hundred a year that he is a member of an exploiting<br>parasite class, and he will think you are mad. In perfect sincerity he will<br>point out to you a dozen ways in which he is worse-off than a working man.<br>In his eyes the workers are not a submerged race of slaves, they are a<br>sinister flood creeping upwards to engulf himself and his friends and his<br>family and to sweep all culture and all decency out of existence. Hence<br>that queer watchful anxiety lest the working class shall grow too<br>prosperous. In a number of Punch soon after the war, when coal was still<br>fetching high prices, there is a picture of four or five miners with grim,<br>sinister faces riding in a cheap motor-car. A friend they are passing calls<br>out and asks them where they have borrowed it. They answer, 'We've bought<br>the thing!' This, you see, is 'good enough for Punch'; for miners to buy a<br>motor-car, even one car between four or five of them, is a monstrosity, a<br>sort of crime against nature. That was the attitude of a dozen years ago,<br>and I see no evidence of any fundamental change. The notion that the<br>working class have been absurdly pampered, hopelessly demoralized by doles,<br>old age pensions, free education, etc., is still widely held; it has merely<br>been a little shaken, perhaps, by the recent recognition that unemployment<br>does exist. For quantities of middle-class people, probably for a large<br>majority of those over fifty, the typical working man still rides to the<br>Labour Exchange on a motor-bike and keeps coal in his bath-tub: 'And, if<br>you'll believe it, my dear, they actually get married on. the dole!'<br><br>The reason why class-hatred seems to be diminishing is that nowadays<br>it tends not to get into print, partly owing to the mealy-mouthed habits of<br>our time, partly because newspapers and even books now have to appeal to a<br>working-class public. As a rule you can best study it in private<br>conversations. But if you want some printed examples, it is worth having a<br>look at the obiter dicta of the late Professor Saintsbury. Saintsbury was a<br>very learned man and along certain lines a judicious literary critic, but<br>when he talked of political or economic matters he only differed from the<br>rest of his class by the fact that he was too thick-skinned and had been<br>born too early to see any reason for pretending to common decency.<br>According to Saintsbury, unemployment insurance was simply 'contributing to<br>the support of lazy ne'er-do-weels', and the whole trade union movement was<br>no more than a kind of organized mendicancy:<br><br><br>'Pauper' is almost actionable now, is it not, when used as a word?<br>though to be paupers, in the sense of being wholly or partly supported at<br>the expense of other people, is the ardent, and to a considerable extent<br>achieved, aspiration of a large proportion of our population, and of an<br>entire political party.<br><br><br><br>(Second Scrap Book)<br><br><br>It is to be noticed, however, that Saintsbury recognizes that<br>unemployment is bound to exist, and, in fact, thinks that it ought<br>to-.exist, so long as the unemployed are made to suffer as much as<br>possible:<br><br><br>Is not 'casual' labour the very secret and safety-valve of a safe<br>and sound labour-system generally?<br><br>... In a complicated industrial and commercial state constant<br>employment at regular wages is impossible; while dole-supported<br>unemployment, at anything like the wages of employment, is demoralizing to<br>begin with and ruinous at its more or less quickly arriving end.<br><br><br>(Last Scrap Book)<br><br><br>What exactly is to happen to the 'casual labourers' when no casual<br>labour happens to be available is not made clear. Presumably (Saintsbury<br>speaks approvingly of 'good Poor Laws') they are to go into the work-house<br>or sleep in the streets. As to the notion that every human being ought as a<br>matter of course to have the chance of earning at least a tolerable<br>livelihood, Saintsbury dismisses it with contempt:<br><br><br>Even the 'right to live' ... extends no further than the right to<br>protection against murder. Charity certainly will, morality possibly may,<br>and public utility perhaps ought to add to this protection supererogatory<br>provision for continuance of life; but it is questionable whether strict<br>justice demands it.<br><br>As for the insane doctrine that being born in a country gives some<br>right to the possession of the soil of that country, it hardly requires<br>notice.<br><br><br>(Last Scrap Book)<br><br><br>It is worth reflecting for a moment upon the beautiful implications of<br>this last passage. The interest of passages like these (and they are<br>scattered all through Saintsbury's work) lies in their having been printed<br>at all. Most people are a little shy of putting that kind of thing on<br>paper. But what Saintsbury is saying here is what any little worm with a<br>fairly safe five hundred a year thinks, and therefore in a way one must<br>admire him for saying it. It takes a lot of guts to be openly such a skunk<br>as that.<br><br>This is the outlook of a confessed reactionary. But how about the<br>middle-class person whose views are not reactionary but 'advanced'? Beneath<br>his revolutionary mask, is he really so different from the other?<br><br>A middle-class person embraces Socialism and perhaps even joins the<br>Communist Party. How much real difference does it make? Obviously, living<br>within the framework of capitalist society, he has got to go on earning his<br>living, and one cannot blame him if he clings to his bourgeois economic<br>status. But is there any change in his tastes, his habits, his manners, his<br>imaginative background--his 'ideology', in Communist jargon? Is there any<br>change in him except that he now votes Labour, or, when possible, Communist<br>at the elections? It is noticeable that he still habitually associates with<br>his own class; he is vastly more at home with a member of his own class,<br>who thinks him a dangerous Bolshie, than with a member of the working class<br>who supposedly agrees with him; his tastes in food, wine, clothes, books,<br>pictures, music, ballet, are still recognizably bourgeois tastes; most<br>significant of all, he invariably marries into his own class. Look at any<br>bourgeois Socialist. Look at Comrade X, member of the C.P.G.B. and author<br>of Marxism for Infants. Comrade X, it so happens, is an old Etonian. He<br>would be ready to die on the barricades, in theory anyway, but you notice<br>that he still leaves his bottom waistcoat button undone. He idealizes the<br>proletariat, but it is remarkable how little his habits resemble theirs.<br>Perhaps once, out of sheer bravado, he has smoked a cigar with the band on,<br>but it would be almost physically impossible for him to put pieces of<br>cheese into his mouth on the point of his knife, or to sit indoors with his<br>cap on, or even to drink his tea out of the saucer. I have known numbers of<br>bourgeois Socialists, I have listened by the hour to their tirades against<br>their own class, and yet never, not even once, have I met one who had<br>picked up proletarian table-manners. Yet, after all, why not? Why should a<br>man who thinks all virtue resides in the proletariat still take such pains<br>to drink his soup silently? It can only be because in his heart he feels<br>that proletarian manners are disgusting. So you see he is still responding<br>to the training of his childhood, when he was taught to hate, fear, and<br>despise the working class. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/6.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/8.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
