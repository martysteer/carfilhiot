<h2>Chapter 11</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Meanwhile what about Socialism?<br><br>It hardly needs pointing out that at this moment we are in a very<br>serious mess, so serious that even the dullest-witted people find it<br>difficult to remain unaware of it. We are living in a world in which nobody<br>is free, in which hardly anybody is secure, in which it is almost<br>impossible to be honest and to remain alive. For enormous blocks of the<br>working class the conditions of life are such as I have described in the<br>opening chapters of this book, and there is no chance of those conditions<br>showing any fundamental improvement. The very best the English-working<br>class can hope for is an occasional temporary decrease in unemployment when<br>this or that industry is artificially stimulated by, for instance,<br>rearmament. Even the middle classes, for the first time in their history,<br>are feeling the pinch. They have not known actual hunger yet, but more and<br>more of them find themselves floundering in a sort of deadly net of<br>frustration in which it is harder and harder to persuade yourself that you<br>are either happy, active, or useful. Even the lucky ones at the top, the<br>real bourgeoisie, are haunted periodically by a consciousness of the<br>miseries below, and still more by fears of the menacing future. And this is<br>merely a preliminary stage, in a country still rich with the loot of a<br>hundred years. Presently there may be coining God knows what horrors--<br>horrors of which, in this sheltered island, we have not even a traditional<br>knowledge.<br><br>And all the while everyone who uses his brain knows that Socialism, as<br>a world-system and wholeheartedly applied, is a way out. It would at least<br>ensure our getting enough to eat even if it deprived us of everything else.<br>Indeed, from one point of view, Socialism is such elementary common sense<br>that I am sometimes amazed that it has not established itself already. The<br>world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of<br>provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all cooperate and see to it<br>that every-one does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of<br>the provisions seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one<br>could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for<br>clinging to the present system. Yet the fact that we have got to face is<br>that Socialism is not establishing itself. Instead of going forward, the<br>cause of Socialism is visibly going back. At this moment Socialists almost<br>everywhere are in retreat before the onslaught of Fascism, and events are<br>moving at terrible speed. As I write this the Spanish Fascist forces are<br>bombarding Madrid, and it is quite likely that before the book is printed<br>we shall have another Fascist country to add to the list, not to mention a<br>Fascist control of the Mediterranean which may have the effect of<br>delivering British foreign policy into the hands of Mussolini. I do not,<br>however, want here to discuss the wider political issues. What I am<br>concerned with is the fact that Socialism is losing ground exactly where it<br>ought to be gaining it. With so much in its favour--for every empty belly<br>is an argument for Socialism--the idea of Socialism is less widely<br>accepted than it was ten years ago. The average thinking person nowadays is<br>not merely not a Socialist, he is actively hostile to Socialism. This must<br>be due chiefly to mistaken methods of propaganda. It means that Socialism,<br>in the form of which it is now presented to us, has about it something<br>inherently distasteful--something that drives away the very people who<br>ought to be nocking to its support.<br><br>A few years ago this might have seemed unimportant. It seems only<br>yesterday that Socialists, especially orthodox Marxists, were telling me<br>with superior smiles that Socialism was going to arrive of its own accord<br>by some mysterious process called 'historic necessity'. Possibly that<br>belief still lingers, but it has been shaken, to say the least of it. Hence<br>the sudden attempts of Communists in various countries to ally themselves<br>with democratic forces which they have been sabotaging for years past. At a<br>moment like this it is desperately necessary to discover just why Socialism<br>has failed in its appeal. And it is no use writing off the current distaste<br>for Socialism as the product of stupidity or corrupt motives. If you want<br>to remove that distaste you have got to understand it, which means getting<br>inside the mind of the ordinary objector to Socialism, or at least<br>regarding his viewpoint sympathetically. No case is really answered until<br>it has had a fair hearing. Therefore, rather paradoxically, in order to<br>defend Socialism it is necessary to start by attacking it.<br><br>In the last three chapters I tried to analyse the difficulties that<br>are raised by our anachronistic class-system; I shall have to touch on that<br>subject again, because I believe that the present intensely stupid handling<br>of the class-issue may stampede quantities of potential Socialists into<br>Fascism. In the chapter following this one I want to discuss certain<br>underlying assumptions that alienate sensitive minds from Socialism. But in<br>the present chapter I am merely dealing with the obvious, preliminary<br>objections--the kind of thing that the person who is not a Socialist (I<br>don't mean the 'Where's the money to come from?' type) always starts by<br>saying when you tax him on the subject. Some of these objections may appear<br>frivolous or self-contradictory, but that is beside the point; I am merely<br>discussing symptoms. Anything is relevant which helps to make clear why<br>Socialism is not accepted. And please notice that I am arguing for<br>Socialism, not against it. But for the moment I am advocatus diaboli. I am<br>making out a case for the sort of person who is in sympathy with the<br>fundamental aims of Socialism, who has the brains to see that Socialism<br>would 'work', but who in practice always takes to flight when Socialism is<br>mentioned.<br><br>Question a person of this type, and you will often get the semi-<br>frivolous answer: 'I don't object to Socialism, but I do object to<br>Socialists.' Logically it is a poor argument, but it carries weight with<br>many people. As with the Christian religion, the worst advertisement for<br>Socialism is its adherents.<br><br>The first thing that must strike any outside observer is that<br>Socialism, in its developed form is a theory confined entirely to the<br>middle classes. The typical Socialist is not, as tremulous old ladies<br>imagine, a ferocious-looking working man with greasy overalls and a raucous<br>voice. He is either a youthful snob-Bolshevik who in five years' time will<br>quite probably have made a wealthy marriage and been converted to Roman<br>Catholicism; or, still more typically, a prim little man with a white-<br>collar job, usually a secret teetotaller and often with vegetarian<br>leanings, with a history of Nonconformity behind him, and, above all, with<br>a social position which he has no intention of forfeiting. This last type<br>is surprisingly common in Socialist parties of every shade; it has perhaps<br>been taken over en bloc from. the old Liberal Party. In addition to this<br>there is the horrible--the really disquieting--prevalence of cranks<br>wherever Socialists are gathered together. One sometimes gets the<br>impression that the mere words 'Socialism' and 'Communism' draw towards<br>them with magnetic force every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer,<br>sex-maniac, Quaker, 'Nature Cure' quack, pacifist, and feminist in England.<br>One day this summer I was riding through Letchworth when the bus stopped<br>and two dreadful-looking old men got on to it. They were both about sixty,<br>both very short, pink, and chubby, and both hatless. One of them was<br>obscenely bald, the other had long grey hair bobbed in the Lloyd George<br>style. They were dressed in pistachio-coloured shirts and khaki shorts into<br>which their huge bottoms were crammed so tightly that you could study every<br>dimple. Their appearance created a mild stir of horror on top of the bus.<br>The man next to me, a commercial traveller I should say, glanced at me, at<br>them, and back again at me, and murmured 'Socialists', as who should say,<br>'Red Indians'. He was probably right--the I.L.P. were holding their<br>summer school at Letchworth. But the point is that to him, as an ordinary<br>man, a crank meant a Socialist and a Socialist meant a crank. Any<br>Socialist, he probably felt, could be counted on to have something<br>eccentric about him. And some such notion seems to exist even among<br>Socialists themselves. For instance, I have here a prospectus from another<br>summer school which states its terms per week and then asks me to say<br>'whether my diet is ordinary or vegetarian'. They take it for granted, you<br>see, that it is necessary to ask this question. This kind of thing is by<br>itself sufficient to alienate plenty of decent people. And their instinct<br>is perfectly sound, for the food-crank is by definition a person willing to<br>cut himself off from human society in hopes of adding five years on to the<br>life of his carcase; that is, a person but of touch with common humanity.<br><br>To this you have got to add the ugly fact that most middle-class<br>Socialists, while theoretically pining for a class-less society, cling like<br>glue to their miserable fragments of social prestige. I remember my<br>sensations of horror on first attending an I.L.P. branch meeting in London.<br>(It might have been rather different in the North, where the bourgeoisie<br>are less thickly scattered.) Are these mingy little beasts, I thought, the<br>champions of the working class? For every person there, male and female,<br>bore the worst stigmata of sniffish middle-class superiority. If a real<br>working man, a miner dirty from the pit, for instance, had suddenly walked<br>into their midst, they would have been embarrassed, angry, and disgusted;<br>some, I should think, would have fled holding their noses. You can see the<br>same tendency in Socialist literature, which, even when it is not openly<br>written de haut en bos, is always completely removed from the working class<br>in idiom and manner of thought. The Coles, Webbs, Stracheys, etc., are not<br>exactly proletarian writers. It is doubtful whether anything describable as<br>proletarian literature now exists--even the Daily Worker is written in<br>standard South English--but a good music-hall comedian comes nearer to<br>producing it than any Socialist writer I can think of. As for the technical<br>jargon of the Communists, it is as far removed from the common speech as<br>the language of a mathematical textbook. I remember hearing a professional<br>Communist speaker address a working-class audience. His speech was the<br>usual bookish stuff, full of long sentences and parentheses and<br>'Notwithstanding' and 'Be that as it may', besides the usual jargon of<br>'ideology' and 'class-consciousness' and 'proletarian solidarity' and all<br>the rest of it. After him a Lancashire working man got up and spoke to the<br>crowd in their own broad lingo. There was not much doubt which of the two<br>was nearer to his audience, but I do not suppose for a moment that the<br>Lancashire working man was an orthodox Communist.<br><br>For it must be remembered that a working man, so long as he remains a<br>genuine working man, is seldom or never a Socialist in the complete,<br>logically consistent sense. Very likely he votes Labour, or even Communist<br>if he gets the chance, but his conception of Socialism is quite different<br>from that of the, book-trained Socialist higher up. To the ordinary working<br>man, the sort you would meet in any pub on Saturday night, Socialism does<br>not mean much more than better wages and shorter' hours and nobody bossing<br>you about. To the more revolutionary type, the type who is a hunger-marcher<br>and is blacklisted by employers, the word is a sort of rallying-cry against<br>the forces of oppression, a vague threat of future violence. But, so far as<br>my experience goes, no genuine working man grasps the deeper implications<br>of Socialism. Often, in my opinion, he is a truer Socialist than the<br>orthodox Marxist, because he does remember, what the other so often<br>forgets, that Socialism means justice and common decency. But what he does<br>not grasp is that Socialism cannot be narrowed down to mere economic<br>justice' and that a reform of that magnitude is bound to work immense<br>changes in our civilization and his own way of life. His vision of the<br>Socialist future is a vision of present society with the worst abuses left<br>out, and with interest centring round the same things as at present--<br>family life, the pub, football, and local politics. As for the philosophic<br>side of Marxism, the pea-and-thimble trick with those three mysterious<br>entities, thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, I have never met a working man<br>who had the faintest interest in it. It is of course true that plenty of<br>people of working-class origin are Socialists of the theoretical bookish<br>type. But they are never people who have remained working men; they don't<br>work with their hands, that is. They belong either to the type I mentioned<br>in the last chapter, the type who squirms into the middle class via the<br>literary intelligentsia, or the type who becomes a Labour M.P. or a high-up<br>trade union official. This last type is one of the most desolating<br>spectacles the world contains. He has been picked out to fight for his<br>mates, and all it means to him is a soft job and the chance of 'bettering'<br>himself. Not merely while but by fighting the bourgeoisie he becomes a<br>bourgeois himself. And meanwhile it is quite possible that he has remained<br>an orthodox Marxist. But I have yet to meet a working miner, steel-worker,<br>cotton-weaver, docker, navvy, or whatnot who was 'ideologically' sound.<br><br>One of the analogies between Communism and Roman Catholicism is that<br>only the 'educated' are completely orthodox. The most immediately striking<br>thing about the English Roman Catholics--I don't mean the real Catholics,<br>I mean the converts: Ronald Knox, Arnold Lunn et hoc genus--is their<br>intense self-consciousness. Apparently they never think, certainly they<br>never write, about anything but the fact that they are Roman Catholics;<br>this single fact and the self-praise resulting from it form the entire<br>stock-in-trade of the Catholic literary man. But the really interesting<br>thing about these people is the way in which they have worked out the<br>supposed implications of orthodoxy until the tiniest details of life are<br>involved. Even the liquids you drink, apparently, can be orthodox or<br>heretical; hence the campaigns of Chesterton, 'Beachcomber', etc., against<br>tea and in favour of beer. According to Chesterton, tea-drinking' is<br>'pagan', while beer-drinking is 'Christian', and coffee is 'the puritan's<br>opium'. It is unfortunate for this theory that Catholics abound in the<br>'Temperance' movement and the greatest tea-boozers in the world are the<br>Catholic Irish; but what I am interested in here is the attitude of mind<br>that can make even food and drink an occasion for religious intolerance. A<br>working-class Catholic would never be so absurdly consistent as that. He<br>does not spend his time in brooding on the fact that he is a Roman<br>Catholic, and he is not particularly conscious of being different from his<br>non-Catholic neighbours. Tell an Irish dock-labourer in the slums of<br>Liverpool that his cup of tea is 'pagan', and he will call you a fool. And<br>even in more serious matters he I does not always grasp the implications of<br>his faith. In the I Roman Catholic homes of Lancashire you see the crucifix<br>I on the wall and the Daily Worker on the table. It is only the 'educated'<br>man, especially the literary man, who knows how to be a bigot. And, mutatis<br>mutandis, it is the same with Communism. The creed is never found in its<br>pure form in a genuine proletarian.<br><br>It may be said, however, that even if the theoretical book-trained<br>Socialist is not a working man himself, at least he is actuated by a love<br>of the working class. He is endeavouring to shed his bourgeois status and<br>fight on the side of the proletariat--that, obviously, must be his<br>motive.<br><br>But is it? Sometimes I look at a Socialist--the intellectual, tract-<br>writing type of Socialist, with his pullover, his fuzzy hair, and his<br>Marxian quotation--and wonder what the devil his motive really is. It is<br>often difficult to believe that it is a love of anybody, especially of the<br>working class, from whom he is of all people the furthest removed. The<br>underlying motive of many Socialists, I believe, is simply a hypertrophied<br>sense of order. The present state of affairs offends them not because it<br>causes misery, still less because it makes freedom impossible, but because<br>it is untidy; what they desire, basically, is to reduce the world to<br>something resembling a chessboard. Take the plays of a lifelong Socialist<br>like Shaw. How much understanding or even awareness of working-class life<br>do they display? Shaw himself declares that you can only bring a working<br>man on the stage 'as an object of compassion'; in practice he doesn't bring<br>him on even as that, but merely as a sort of W. W. Jacobs figure of fun--<br>the ready-made comic East Ender, like those in Major Barbara and Captain<br>Brassbound's Conversion. At best his attitude to the working class is the<br>sniggering Punch attitude, in more serious moments (consider, for instance,<br>the young man who symbolizes the dispossessed classes in Misalliance) he<br>finds them merely contemptible and disgusting. Poverty and, what is more,<br>the habits of mind created by poverty, are something to be abolished from<br>above, by violence if necessary; perhaps even preferably by violence. Hence<br>his worship of 'great' men and appetite for dictatorships, Fascist or<br>Communist; for to him, apparently (vide his remarks apropos of the Italo-<br>Abyssinian war and the Stalin-Wells conversations), Stalin and Mussolini<br>are almost equivalent persons. You get the same thing in a more mealy-<br>mouthed form in Mrs Sidney Webb's autobiography, which gives,<br>unconsciously, a most revealing picture of the high-minded Socialist slum-<br>visitor. The truth is that, to many people calling themselves Socialists,<br>revolution does not mean a movement of the masses with which they hope to<br>associate themselves; it means a set of reforms which 'we', the clever<br>ones, are going to impose upon 'them', the Lower Orders. On the other hand,<br>it would be a mistake to regard the book-trained Socialist as a bloodless<br>creature entirely incapable of emotion. Though seldom giving much evidence<br>of affection for the exploited, he is perfectly capable of displaying<br>hatred--a sort of queer, theoretical, in vacua hatred--against the<br>exploiters. Hence the grand old Socialist sport of denouncing the<br>bourgeoisie. It is strange how easily almost any Socialist writer can lash<br>himself into frenzies of rage against the class to which, by birth or by<br>adoption, he himself invariably belongs. Sometimes the hatred of bourgeois<br>habits and 'ideology' is so far-reaching that it extends even to bourgeois<br>characters in books. According to Henri Barbusse, the characters in the<br>novels of Proust, Gide, etc., are 'characters whom one would dearly love to<br>have at the other side of a barricade'. 'A barricade', you observe. Judging<br>from Le Feu, I should have thought Barbusse's experience of barricades had<br>left him with a distaste for them. But the imaginary bayoneting of<br>'bourgeois', who presumably don't hit back, is a bit different from the<br>real article.<br><br>The best example of bourgeois-baiting literature that I have yet come<br>across is Mirsky's Intelligentsia of Great Britain. This is a very<br>interesting and ably-written book, and it should be read by everyone who<br>wants to understand the rise of Fascism. Mirsky (formerly Prince Mirsky)<br>was a White Russian emigre who came to England and was for some years a<br>lecturer in Russian literature at London University. Later he was converted<br>to Communism, returned to Russia, and produced his book as a sort of 'show-<br>up' of the British intelligentsia from a Marxist standpoint. It is a<br>viciously malignant book, with an unmistakable note of 'Now I'm out of your<br>reach I can say what I like about you' running all through it, and apart<br>from a general distortion it contains some quite definite and probably<br>intentional misrepresentation: as, for instance, when Conrad is declared to<br>be 'no less imperialist than Kipling', and D. H. Lawrence is described as<br>writing 'bare-bodied pornography' and as having 'succeeded in erasing all<br>clues to his proletarian origin'--as though Lawrence had been a pork-<br>butcher climbing into the House of Lords! This kind of thing is very<br>disquieting when one remembers that it is addressed to a Russian audience<br>who have no means of checking its accuracy. But what I am thinking of at<br>the moment is the effect of such a book on the English public. Here you<br>have a literary man of aristocratic extraction, a man who had probably<br>never in his life spoken to a working man on any-thing approaching equal<br>terms, uttering venomous screams of libel against his 'bourgeois'<br>colleagues. Why? So far as appearances go, from pure malignity. He is<br>battling against the British intelligentsia, but what is he battling for?<br>Within the book itself there is no indication. Hence the net effect of<br>books like this is to give outsiders the impression that there is nothing<br>in Communism except hatred. And here once again you come upon that queer<br>resemblance between Communism and (convert) Roman Catholicism. If you want<br>to find a book as evil-spirited as The Intelligentsia of Great Britain, the<br>likeliest place to look is among the popular Roman Catholic apologists. You<br>will find there the same venom and the same dishonesty, though, to do the<br>Catholic justice, you will not usually find the same bad manners. Queer<br>that Comrade Mirsky's spiritual brother should be Father---! The<br>Communist and the Catholic are not saying the same thing, in a sense they<br>are even saying opposite things, and each would gladly boil the other in<br>oil if circumstances permitted; but from the point of view of an outsider<br>they are very much alike.<br><br>The fact is that Socialism, in the form in which it is now presented,<br>appeals chiefly to unsatisfactory or even inhuman types. On the one hand<br>you have the warm-hearted un-thinking Socialist, the typical working-class<br>Socialist, who only wants to abolish poverty and does not always grasp what<br>this implies. On the other hand, you have the intellectual, book-trained<br>Socialist, who understands that it is necessary to throw our present<br>civilization down the sink and is quite willing to do so. And this type is<br>drawn, to begin with, entirely from the middle class, and from a rootless<br>town-bred section of the middle class at that. Still more unfortunately, it<br>includes--so much so that to an outsider it even appears to be composed<br>of--the kind of people I have been discussing; the foaming denouncers of<br>the bourgeoisie, and the more-water-iri-your-beer reformers of whom Shaw is<br>the prototype, and the astute young social-literary climbers who are<br>Communists now, as they will be Fascists five years hence, because it is<br>all the go, and all that dreary tribe of high-minded' women and sandal-<br>wearers and bearded fruit-juice drinkers who come nocking towards the smell<br>of 'progress' like bluebottles to a dead cat. The ordinary decent person,<br>who is in sympathy with the essential aims of Socialism, is given the<br>impression that there is no room for his kind in any Socialist party that<br>means business. Worse, he is driven to the cynical conclusion that<br>Socialism is a kind of doom which is probably coming but must be staved off<br>as long as possible. Of course, as I have suggested already, it is not<br>strictly fair to judge a movement by its adherents; but the point is that<br>people invariably do so, and that the popular conception of Socialism is<br>coloured by the conception of a Socialist as a dull or disagreeable person.<br>'Socialism' is pictured as a state of affairs in which our more vocal<br>Socialists would feel thoroughly at home. This does great harm to the<br>cause. The ordinary man may not flinch from a dictatorship of the<br>proletariat, if you offer it tactfully; offer him a dictatorship of the<br>prigs, and he gets ready to fight.<br><br>There is a widespread feeling that any civilization in which Socialism<br>was a reality would bear the same relation to our own as a brand-new bottle<br>of colonial burgundy, bears to a few spoonfuls of first-class Beaujolais.<br>We live, admittedly, amid the wreck of a civilization, but it has been a<br>great civilization in its day, and in patches it still flourishes almost<br>undisturbed. It still has its bouquet, so to speak; whereas the imagined<br>Socialist future, like the colonial burgundy, tastes only of iron and<br>water. Hence the fact, which is really a disastrous one, that artists of<br>any consequence can never be persuaded into the Socialist fold. This is<br>particularly the case with the writer whose political opinions are more<br>directly and obviously connected with his work than those of, say, a<br>painter. If one faces facts one must admit that nearly everything<br>describable as Socialist literature is dull, tasteless, and bad. Consider<br>the situation in England at the present moment. A whole generation has<br>grown up more or less in familiarity with the idea of Socialism; and yet<br>the higher-water mark, so to speak, of Socialist literature is W. H. Auden,<br>a sort of gutless Kipling,[Orwell somewhat retracted this remark later.<br>See 'Inside the Whale', England Your England, p. 120 (Seeker & Warburg<br>Collected Edition).] and the even feebler poets who are associated<br>with him. Every writer of consequence and every book worth reading is on<br>the other side. I am willing to believe that it is otherwise in Russia--<br>about which I know nothing, however--for presumably in post-revolutionary<br>Russia the mere violence of events would tend to throw up a vigorous<br>literature of sorts. But it is certain that in Western Europe Socialism has<br>produced no literature worth having. A little while ago, when the issues<br>were less clear, there were writers of some vitality who called themselves<br>Socialists, but they were using the word as a vague label. Thus, if Ibsen<br>and Zola described themselves as Socialists, it did not mean much more than<br>that they were 'progressives', while in the case of Anatole France it meant<br>merely that he was an anticlerical. The real Socialist writers, the<br>propagandist writers, have always been dull, empty windbags--Shaw,<br>Barbusse, Upton Sinclair, William Morris, Waldo Frank, etc., etc. I am not,<br>of course, suggesting that Socialism is to be condemned because literary<br>gents don't like it; I am not even suggesting that it ought necessarily to<br>produce literature on its own account, though I do think it a bad sign that<br>it has produced no songs worth singing. I am. merely pointing to the fact<br>that writers of genuine talent are usually indifferent to Socialism, and<br>sometimes actively and mischievously hostile. And this is a disaster, not<br>only for the writers themselves, but for the cause of Socialism, which has<br>great need of them.<br><br>This, then, is the superficial aspect of the ordinary man's recoil<br>from Socialism. I know the whole dreary argument very thoroughly, because I<br>know it from both sides. Every-thing that I say here I have both said to<br>ardent Socialists who were trying to convert me, and had said to me by<br>bored non-Socialists whom I was trying to convert. The whole thing amounts<br>to a kind of malaise produced by dislike of individual Socialists,<br>especially of the cocksure Marx-quoting type. Is it childish to be<br>influenced by that kind of thing? Is it silly? Is it even contemptible? It<br>is all that, but the point is that it happens, and therefore it is<br>important to keep it in mind. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/9.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/11.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
