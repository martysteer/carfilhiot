<h2>Chapter 10</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">But unfortunately you do not solve the class problem by making friends with<br>tramps. At most you get rid of some of your own class-prejudice by doing<br>so.<br><br>Tramps, beggars, criminals, and social outcasts generally are very<br>exceptional beings and no more typical of the working class as a whole<br>than, say, the literary intelligentsia are typical of the bourgeoisie. It<br>is quite easy to be on terms of intimacy with a foreign 'intellectual', but<br>it is not at all easy to be on terms of intimacy with an ordinary<br>respectable foreigner of the middle class. How many Englishmen have seen<br>the inside of an ordinary French bourgeois family, for instance? Probably<br>it would be quite impossible to do so, short of marrying into it. And it is<br>rather similar with the English working class. Nothing is easier than to be<br>bosom pals with a pickpocket, if you know where to look for him; but it is<br>very difficult to be bosom pals with a bricklayer.<br><br>But why is it so easy to be on equal terms with social outcasts?<br>People have often said to me, 'Surely when you are with the tramps they<br>don't really accept you as one of themselves? Surely they notice that you<br>are different--notice the difference of accent?' etc., etc. As a matter<br>of fact, a fair proportion of tramps, well over a quarter I should say,<br>notice nothing of the kind. To begin with, many people have no ear for<br>accent and judge you entirely by your clothes. I was often struck by this<br>fact when I was begging at back doors. Some people were obviously surprised<br>by my 'educated' accent, others completely failed to notice it; I was dirty<br>and ragged and that was all they saw. Again, tramps come from all parts of<br>the British Isles and the variation in English accents is enormous. A tramp<br>is used to hearing all kinds of accents among his mates, some of them so<br>strange to him that he can hardly understand them, and a man from, say,<br>Cardiff or Durham or Dublin does not necessarily know which of the south<br>English accents is an 'educated' one. In any case men with 'educated'<br>accents, though rare among tramps, are not unknown. But even when tramps<br>are aware that you are of different origin from themselves, it does not<br>necessarily alter their attitude. From their point of view all that matters<br>is that you, like themselves, are 'on the bum'. And in that world it is not<br>done to ask too many questions. You can tell people the history of your<br>life if you choose, and most tramps do so on the smallest provocation, but<br>you are under no compulsion to tell it and whatever story you tell will be<br>accepted without question. Even a bishop could be at home among tramps if<br>he wore the right clothes; and even if they knew he was a bishop it might<br>not make any difference, provided that they also knew or believed that he<br>was genuinely destitute. Once you are in that world and seemingly of it, it<br>hardly matters what you have been in the past. It is a sort of world-<br>within-a-world where everyone is equal, a small squalid democracy--<br>perhaps the nearest thing to a democracy that exists in England.<br><br>But when you come to the normal working class the position is totally<br>different. To begin with, there is no short cut into their midst. You can<br>become a tramp simply by putting on the right clothes and going to the<br>nearest casual ward, but you can't become a navvy or a coal-miner. You<br>couldn't get a job as a navvy or a coal-miner even if you were equal to the<br>work. Via Socialist politics you can get in touch with the working-class<br>intelligentsia, but they are hardly more typical than tramps or burglars.<br>For the rest you can only mingle with the working class by staying in their<br>houses as a lodger, which always has a dangerous resemblance to 'slumming'.<br>For some months I lived entirely in coal-miners' houses. I ate my meals<br>with the family, I washed at the kitchen sink, I shared bedrooms with<br>miners, drank beer with them, played darts with them, talked to them by the<br>hour together. But though I was among them, and I hope and trust they did<br>not find me a nuisance, I was not one of them, and they knew it even better<br>than I did. However much you like them, however interesting you find their<br>conversation, there is always that accursed itch of class-difference, like<br>the pea under the princess's mattress. It is not a question of dislike or<br>distaste, only of difference, but it is enough to make real intimacy<br>impossible. Even with miners who described themselves as Communists I found<br>that it needed tactful manoeuvrings to prevent them from calling me 'sir';<br>and all of them, except in moments of great animation, softened their<br>northern accents for my benefit. I liked them and hoped they liked me; but<br>I went among them as a foreigner, and both of us were aware of it.<br>Whichever way you turn this curse of class-difference confronts you like a<br>wall of stone. Or rather it is not so much like a stone wall as the plate-<br>glass pane of an aquarium; it is so easy to pretend that it isn't there,<br>and so impossible to get through it.<br><br>Unfortunately it is nowadays the fashion to pretend that the glass is<br>penetrable. Of course everyone knows that class-prejudice exists, but at<br>the same time everyone claims that he, in some mysterious way, is exempt<br>from it. Snob-bishness is one of those vices which we can discern in every-<br>one else but' never in ourselves. Not only the croyant et pratiquant<br>Socialist, but every 'intellectual' takes it as a matter of course that he<br>at least is outside the class-racket; he, unlike his neighbours, can see<br>through the absurdity of wealth, ranks, titles, etc., etc. 'I'm not a snob'<br>is nowadays a kind of universal credo. Who is there who has not jeered at<br>the House of Lords, the military caste, the Royal Family, the public<br>schools, the huntin' and shootin' people, the old ladies in Cheltenham<br>boarding-houses, the horrors of 'county' society, and the social hierarchy<br>generally? To do so has become an automatic gesture. You notice this<br>particularly in novels. Every novelist of serious pretensions adopts an<br>ironic attitude towards his upper-class characters. Indeed when a novelist<br>has to put a definitely upper-class person--a duke or a baronet or<br>whatnot--into one of his stories he guys him more or less instinctively.<br>There is an important subsidiary cause of this in the poverty of the modern<br>upper-class dialect. The speech of 'educated' people is now so lifeless and<br>characterless that a novelist can do nothing with it. By far the easiest<br>way of making it amusing is to burlesque it, which means pretending that<br>every upper-class person is an ineffectual ass. The trick is imitated from<br>novelist to novelist, and in the end becomes almost a reflex action.<br><br>And yet all the while, at the bottom of his heart, every-one knows<br>that this is humbug. We all rail against class-distinctions, but very few<br>people seriously want to abolish them. Here you come upon the important<br>fact that every revolutionary opinion draws part of its strength from a<br>secret conviction that nothing can be changed.<br><br>If you want a good illustration of this, it is worth studying the<br>novels and plays of John Galsworthy, keeping one eye on their chronology.<br>Galsworthy is a very fine specimen of the thin-skinned, tear-in-the-eye,<br>pre-war humanitarian. He starts out with a morbid pity-complex which<br>extends even to thinking that every married woman is an angel chained to a<br>satyr. He is in a perpetual quiver of indignation over the sufferings of<br>overworked clerks, of under-paid farm hands, of fallen women, of criminals,<br>of prostitutes, of animals. The world, as he sees it in his earlier books<br>(The Man of Property, Justice, etc.), is divided into oppressors and<br>oppressed, with the oppressors sitting on top like some monstrous stone<br>idol which all the dynamite in the world cannot overthrow. But is it so<br>certain that he really wants it overthrown? On the contrary, in his fight<br>against an immovable tyranny he is upheld by the consciousness that it is<br>immovable. When things happen unexpectedly and the world-order which he has<br>known begins to crumble, he feels somewhat differently about it. So, having<br>set out to be the champion of the underdog against tyranny and injustice,<br>he ends by advocating (vide The Silver Spoon) that the English working<br>class, to cure their economic ills, shall be deported to the colonies like<br>batches of cattle. If he had lived ten years longer he would quite probably<br>have arrived at some genteel version of Fascism. This is the inevitable<br>fate of the sentimentalist. All his opinions change into their opposites at<br>the first brush of reality.<br><br>The same streak of soggy half-baked insincerity runs through all<br>'advanced' opinion. Take the question of imperialism, for instance. Every<br>left-wing 'intellectual' is, as a matter of course, an anti-imperialist. He<br>claims to be outside the empire-racket as automatically and self-right-<br>eously as he claims to be outside the class-racket. Even the right-wing<br>'intellectual', who is not definitely in revolt against British<br>imperialism, pretends to regard it with a sort of amused detachment. It is<br>so easy to be witty about the British Empire. The White Man's Burden and<br>'Rule, Britannia' and Kipling's novels and Anglo-Indian bores--who could<br>even mention such things without a snigger? And is there any cultured<br>person who has not at least once in his life made a joke about that old<br>Indian havildar who said that if the British left India there would not be<br>a rupee or a virgin left between Peshawar and Delhi (or wherever it was)?<br>That is the attitude of the typical left-winger towards imperialism, and a<br>thoroughly flabby, boneless attitude it is. For in the last resort, the<br>only important question is. Do you want the British Empire to hold together<br>or do you want it to disintegrate? And at the bottom of his heart no<br>Englishman, least of all the kind of person who is witty about Anglo-Indian<br>colonels, does want it to disintegrate. For, apart from any other<br>consideration, the high standard of life we enjoy in England depends upon<br>our keeping a tight hold on the Empire, particularly the tropical portions<br>of it such as India and Africa. Under the capitalist system, in order that<br>England may live in comparative comfort, a hundred million Indians must<br>live on the verge of starvation--an evil state of affairs, but you<br>acquiesce in it every time you step into a taxi or eat a plate of<br>strawberries and cream. The alternative is to throw the Empire overboard<br>and reduce England to a cold and unimportant little island where we should<br>all have to work very hard and live mainly on herrings and potatoes. That<br>is the very last thing that any left-winger wants. Yet the left-winger<br>continues to feel that he has no moral responsibility for imperialism. He<br>is perfectly ready to accept the products of Empire and to save his soul by<br>sneering at the people who hold the Empire together.<br><br>It is at this point that one begins to grasp the unreality of most<br>people's attitude towards the class question. So long as it is merely a<br>question of ameliorating the worker's lot, every decent person is agreed.<br>Take a coal-miner, for example. Everyone, barring fools and scoundrels,<br>would like to see the miner better off. If, for instance, the miner could<br>ride to the coal face in a comfortable trolley instead of crawling on his<br>hands and knees, if he could work a three-hour shift instead of seven and a<br>half hours, if he could live in a decent house with five bedrooms and a<br>bath-room and have ten pounds a week wages--splendid! Moreover, anyone<br>who uses his brain knows perfectly well that this is within the range of<br>possibility. The world, potentially at least, is immensely rich; develop it<br>as it might be developed, and we could all live like princes, supposing<br>that we wanted to. And to a very superficial glance the social side of the<br>question looks equally simple. In a sense it is true that almost everyone<br>would like to see class-distinctions abolished. Obviously this perpetual<br>uneasiness between man and man, from which we suffer in modern England, is<br>a curse and a nuisance. Hence the temptation few scoutmasterish bellows of<br>good-will. Stop calling me 'sir', you chaps! Surely we're all men? Let's<br>pal up and get our shoulders to the wheel and remember that we're all<br>equal, and what the devil does it matter if I know what kind of ties to<br>wear and you don't, and I drink my soup comparatively quietly and you drink<br>yours with the noise of water going down a waste-pipe--and so on and so<br>on and so on; all of it the most pernicious rubbish, but quite alluring<br>when it is suitably expressed.<br><br>But unfortunately you get no further by merely wishing class-<br>distinctions away. More exactly, it is necessary to wish them away, but<br>your wish has no efficacy unless you grasp what it involves. The fact that<br>has got to be faced is that to abolish class-distinctions means abolishing<br>a part of yourself. Here am I, a typical member of the middle class. It is<br>easy for me to say that I want to get rid of class-distinctions, but nearly<br>everything I think and do is a result of class-distinctions. All my notions<br>--notions of good and evil, of pleasant and unpleasant, of funny and<br>serious, of ugly and beautiful--are essentially middle-class notions; my<br>taste in books and food and clothes, my sense of honour, my table manners,<br>my turns of speech, my accent, even the characteristic movements of my<br>body, are the products of a special kind of upbringing and a special niche<br>about half-way up the social hierarchy. When I grasp this I grasp that it<br>is no use clapping a proletarian on the back and telling him that he is as<br>good a man as I am; if I want real contact with him, I have got to make an<br>effort for which very likely I am unprepared. For to get outside the class-<br>racket I have got to suppress not merely my private snobbishness, but most<br>of my other tastes and prejudices as well. I have got to alter myself so<br>completely that at the end I should hardly be recognizable as the same<br>person. What is involved is not merely the amelioration of working-class<br>conditions, nor an avoidance of the more stupid forms of snobbery, but a<br>complete abandonment of the upper-class and middle-class attitude to life.<br>And whether I say Yes or No probably depends upon the extent to which I<br>grasp what is demanded of me.<br><br>Many people, however, imagine that they can abolish class-distinctions<br>without making any uncomfortable change in their own habits and 'ideology'.<br>Hence the eager class-breaking activities which one can see in progress on<br>all sides. Everywhere there are people of goodwill who quite honestly<br>believe that they are working for the overthrow of class-distinctions. The<br>middle-class Socialist enthuses over the proletariat and runs 'summer<br>schools' where the proletarian and the repentant bourgeois are supposed to<br>fall upon one another's necks and be brothers for ever; and the bourgeois<br>visitors come away saying how wonderful and inspiring it has all been (the<br>proletarian ones come away saying something different). And then there is<br>the outer-suburban creeping Jesus, a hangover from the William Morris<br>period, but still surprisingly common, who goes about saying 'Why must we<br>level down? Why not level up?' and proposes to level the working class 'up'<br>(up to his own standard) by means of hygiene, fruit-juice, birth-control,<br>poetry, etc. Even the Duke of York (now King George VI) runs a yearly camp<br>where public-school boys and boys from the slums are supposed to mix on<br>exactly equal terms, and do mix for the time being, rather like the animals<br>in one of those 'Happy Family' cages where a dog, a cat, two ferrets, a<br>rabbit, and three canaries preserve an armed truce while the showman's eye<br>is on them.<br><br>All such deliberate, conscious efforts at class-breaking are, I am<br>convinced, a very serious mistake. Sometimes they are merely futile, but<br>where they do show a definite result it is usually to intensify class-<br>prejudice. This, if you come to think of it, is only what might be<br>expected. You have forced the pace and set up an uneasy, unnatural equality<br>between class and class; the resultant friction brings to the surface all<br>kinds of feelings that might other-wise have remained buried, perhaps for<br>ever. As I said apropos of Galsworthy, the opinions of the sentimentalist<br>change into their opposites at the first touch of reality. Scratch the<br>average pacifist and you find a jingo. The middle-class I.L.P.'er and the<br>bearded fruit-juice drinker are all for a classless society so long as they<br>see the proletariat through the wrong end of the telescope; force them into<br>any real contact with a proletarian--let them get into a fight with a<br>drunken fish-porter on Saturday night, for instance--and they are capable<br>of swinging back to the most ordinary middle-class snobbishness. Most<br>middle-class Socialists, however, are very unlikely to get into fights with<br>drunken fish-porters; when they do make a genuine contact with the working<br>class, it is usually with the working-class intelligentsia. But the<br>working-class intelligentsia is sharply divisible into two different types.<br>There is the type who remains working-class--who goes on working as a<br>mechanic or a dock-labourer or whatever it may be and does not bother to<br>change his working-class accent and habits, but who 'improves his mind' in<br>his spare time and works for the I.L.P. or the Communist Party; and there<br>is the type who does alter his way of life, at least externally, and who by<br>means of State scholarships succeeds in climbing into the middle class. The<br>first is one of the finest types of man we have. I can think of some I have<br>met whom not even the most hidebound Tory could help liking and admiring.<br>The other type, with exceptions--D. H. Lawrence, for example--is less<br>admirable.<br><br>To begin with, it is a pity, though it is a natural result of the<br>scholarship system, that the proletariat should tend to interpenetrate the<br>middle class via the literary intelligentsia. For it is not easy to crash<br>your way into the literary intelligentsia if you happen to be a decent<br>human being. The modem English literary world, at any rate the high-brow<br>section of it, is a sort of poisonous jungle where only weeds can flourish.<br>It is just possible to be a literary gent and to keep your decency if you<br>are a definitely popular writer--a writer of detective stories, for<br>instance; but to be a highbrow, with a footing in the snootier magazines,<br>means delivering yourself over to horrible campaigns of wire-pulling and<br>backstairs-crawling. In the highbrow world you 'get on', if you 'get on' at<br>all, not so much by your literary ability as by being the life and soul of<br>cocktail parties and kissing the bums of verminous little lions. This,<br>then, is the world that most readily opens its doors to the proletarian who<br>is climbing out of his own class. The 'clever' boy of a working-class<br>family, the sort of boy who wins scholarships and is obviously not fitted<br>for a life of manual labour, may find other ways of rising into the class<br>above--a slightly different type, for instance, rises via Labour Party<br>politics--but the literary way is by far the most usual. Literary London<br>now teems with young men who are of proletarian origin and have been<br>educated by means of scholarships. Many of them are very disagreeable<br>people, quite unrepresentative of their class, and it is most unfortunate<br>that when a person of bourgeois origin does succeed in meeting a<br>proletarian face to face on equal terms, this is the type he most commonly<br>meets. For the result is to drive the bourgeois, who has idealized the<br>proletariat so long as he knew nothing about them, back into frenzies of<br>snobbishness. The process is sometimes very comic to watch, if you happen<br>to be watching it from the outside. The poor well-meaning bourgeois, eager<br>to embrace his proletarian brother, leaps forward with open arms; and only<br>a little while later he is in retreat, minus a borrowed five pounds and<br>exclaiming dolefully, 'But, dash it, the fellow's not a gentleman!'<br><br>The thing that disconcerts the bourgeois in a contact of this kind is<br>to find certain of his own professions being taken seriously. I have<br>pointed out that the left-wing opinions of the average 'intellectual' are<br>mainly spurious. From pure imitativeness he jeers at things which in fact<br>he believes in. As one example out of many, take the public-school code of<br>honour, with its 'team spirit' and 'Don't hit a man when he's down', and<br>all the rest of that familiar bunkum. Who has not laughed at it? Who,<br>calling himself an 'intellectual', would dare not to laugh at it? But it is<br>a bit different when you meet somebody who laughs at it from the outside;<br>just as we spend our lives in abusing England but grow very angry when we<br>hear a foreigner saying exactly the same things. No one has been more<br>amusing about the public schools than 'Beachcomber' of the Express. He<br>laughs, quite rightly, at the ridiculous code which makes cheating at cards<br>the worst of all sins. But would 'Beachcomber' like it if one of his own<br>friends was caught cheating at cards? I doubt it. It is only when you meet<br>someone of a different culture from yourself that you begin to realize what<br>your own beliefs really are. If you are a bourgeois 'intellectual' you too<br>readily imagine that you have somehow become unbourgeois because you find<br>it easy to laugh at patriotism and the G. of E. and the Old School Tie and<br>Colonel Blimp and all the rest of it. But from the point of view of the<br>proletarian 'intellectual', who at least by origin is genuinely outside the<br>bourgeois culture, your resemblances to Colonel Blimp may be more important<br>than your differences. Very likely he looks upon you and Colonel Blimp as<br>practically equivalent persons; and in a way he is right, though neither<br>you nor Colonel Blimp would admit it. So that the meeting of proletarian<br>and bourgeois, when they do succeed in meeting, is not always the embrace<br>of long-lost brothers; too often it is the clash of alien cultures which<br>can only meet in war.<br><br>I have been looking at this from the point of view of the bourgeois<br>who finds his secret beliefs challenged and is driven back to a frightened<br>conservatism. But one has also got to consider the antagonism that is<br>aroused in the proletarian 'intellectual'. By his own efforts and sometimes<br>with frightful agonies he has struggled out of his own class into another<br>where he expects to find a wider freedom and a greater intellectual<br>refinement; and all he finds, very often, is a sort of hollowness, a<br>deadness, a lack of any warm human feeling--of any real life whatever.<br>Sometimes the bourgeoisie seem to him just dummies with money and water in<br>their veins instead of blood. This at any rate is what he says, and almost<br>any young highbrow of proletarian origin will spin you this line of talk.<br>Hence the 'proletarian' cant from which we now suffer. Everyone knows, or<br>ought to know by this time, how it runs: the bourgeoisie are 'dead' (a<br>favourite word of abuse nowadays and very effective be-cause meaningless),<br>bourgeois culture is bankrupt, bourgeois 'values' are despicable, and so on<br>and so forth; if you want examples, see any number of the Left Review or<br>any of the younger Communist writers such as Alee Brown, Philip Henderson,<br>etc. The sincerity of much of this is suspect, but D. H. Lawrence, who was<br>sincere, whatever else he may not have been, expresses the same thought<br>over and over again. It is curious how he harps upon that idea that the<br>English bourgeoisie are all dead, or at least gelded. Mellors, the<br>gamekeeper in Lady Chatterley's Lover (really Lawrence himself), has had<br>the opportunity to get out of his own class and does not particularly want<br>to return to it, because English working people have various 'disagree-able<br>habits'; on the other hand the bourgeoisie, with whom he has also mixed to<br>some extent, seem to him half dead, a race of eunuchs. Lady Chatterley's<br>husband, symbolically, is impotent in the actual physical sense. And then<br>there is the poem about the young man (once again Lawrence himself) who<br>'got up to the top of the tree' but came down saying:<br><br><br>Oh you've got to be like a monkey<br>if you climb up the tree!<br>You've no more use for the solid earth<br>and the lad you used to be.<br>You sit in the boughs and gibber<br>with superiority.<br>They all gibber and gibber and chatter,<br>and never a word they say<br>comes really out of their guts, lad,<br>they make it up half-way. ...<br>I tell you something's been done to 'em,<br>to the pullets up above;<br>there's not a cock bird among 'em, etc., etc.<br><br><br>You could hardly have it in plainer terms than that. Possibly by the<br>people at 'the top of the tree' Lawrence only means the real bourgeoisie,<br>those in the L2000 a year class and over, but I doubt it. More probably he<br>means everyone who is more or less within the bourgeois culture--everyone<br>who was brought up with a mincing accent and in a house where there were<br>one or two servants. And at this point you realize the danger of the<br>'proletarian' cant--realize, I mean, the terrible antagonism that it is<br>capable of arousing. For when you come to such an accusation as this, you<br>are up against a blank wall. Lawrence tells me that because I have been to<br>a public school I am a eunuch. Well, what about it? I can produce medical<br>evidence to the contrary, but what good will that do? Lawrence's<br>condemnation remains. If you tell me I am a scoundrel I may mend my ways,<br>but if you tell me I am a eunuch you are tempting me to hit back in any way<br>that seems feasible. If you want to make an enemy of a man, tell him that<br>his ills are incurable.<br><br>This then is the net result of most meetings between proletarian and<br>bourgeois: they lay bare a real antagonism which is intensified by the<br>'proletarian' cant, itself the product of forced contacts between class and<br>class. The only sensible procedure is to go slow and not force the pace. If<br>you secretly think of yourself as a gentleman and as such the superior of<br>the greengrocer's errand boy, it is far better to say so than to tell lies<br>about it. Ultimately you have got to drop your snobbishness, but it is<br>fatal to pretend to drop it before you are really ready to do so.<br><br>Meanwhile one can observe on every side that dreary phenomenon, the<br>middle-class person who is an ardent Socialist at twenty-five and a<br>sniffish Conservative at thirty-five. In a way his recoil is natural enough<br>--at any rate, one can see how his thoughts run. Perhaps a classless<br>society doesn't mean a beatific state of affairs in which we shall all go<br>on behaving exactly as before except that there will be no class-hatred and<br>no snobbishness; perhaps it means a bleak world in which all our ideals,<br>our codes, our tastes--our 'ideology', in fact--will have no meaning.<br>Perhaps this class-breaking business isn't so simple as it looked! On the<br>contrary, it is a wild ride into the darkness, and it may be that at the<br>end of it the smile will be on the face of the tiger. With loving though<br>slightly patronizing smiles we set out to greet our proletarian brothers,<br>and behold! our proletarian brothers--in so far as we understand them--<br>are not asking for our greetings, they are asking us to commit suicide.<br>When the bourgeois sees it in that form he takes to flight, and if his<br>flight is rapid enough it may carry him to Fascism. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/8.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/10.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
