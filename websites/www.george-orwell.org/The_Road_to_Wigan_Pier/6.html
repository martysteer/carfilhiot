<h2>Chapter 7</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">As you travel northward your eye, accustomed to the South or East, does not<br>notice much difference until you are beyond Birmingham. In Coventry you<br>might as well be in Finsbury Park, and the Bull Ring in Birmingham is not<br>unlike Norwich Market, and between all the towns of the Midlands there<br>stretches a villa-civilization indistinguishable from that of the South. It<br>is only when you get a little further north, to the pottery towns and<br>beyond, that you begin to encounter the real ugliness of industrialism--<br>an ugliness so frightful and so arresting that you are obliged, as it were,<br>to come to terms with it.<br><br>A slag-heap is at best a hideous thing, because it is so planless and<br>functionless. It is something just dumped on the earth, like the emptying<br>of a giant's dust-bin. On the outskirts of the mining towns there are<br>frightful landscapes where your horizon is ringed completely round by<br>jagged grey mountains, and underfoot is mud and ashes and over-head the<br>steel cables where tubs of dirt travel slowly across miles of country.<br>Often the slag-heaps are on fire, and at night you can see the red rivulets<br>of fire winding this way and that, and also the slow-moving blue flames of<br>sulphur, which always seem on the point of expiring and always spring out<br>again. Even when a slag-heap sinks, as it does ultimately, only an evil<br>brown grass grows on it, and it retains its hummocky surface. One in the<br>slums of Wigan, used as a playground, looks like a choppy sea suddenly<br>frozen; 'the flock mattress', it is called locally. Even centuries hence<br>when the plough drives over the places where coal was once mined, the sites<br>of ancient slag-heaps will still be distinguishable from an aeroplane.<br><br>I remember a winter afternoon in the dreadful environs of Wigan. All<br>round was the lunar landscape of slag-heaps, and to the north, through the<br>passes, as it were, between the mountains of slag, you could see the<br>factory chimneys sending out their plumes of smoke. The canal path was a<br>mixture of cinders and frozen mud, criss-crossed by the imprints of<br>innumerable clogs, and all round, as far as the slag-heaps in the distance,<br>stretched the 'flashes'--pools of stagnant water that had seeped into the<br>hollows caused by the subsidence of ancient pits. It was horribly cold. The<br>'flashes' were covered with ice the colour of raw umber, the bargemen were<br>muffled to the eyes in sacks, the lock gates wore beards of ice. It seemed<br>a world from which vegetation had been banished; nothing existed except<br>smoke, shale, ice, mud, ashes, and foul water. But even Wigan is beautiful<br>compared with Sheffield. Sheffield, I suppose, could justly claim to be<br>called the ugliest town in the Old World: its inhabitants, who want it to<br>be pre-eminent in everything, very likely do make that claim for it. It has<br>a population of half a million and it contains fewer decent buildings than<br>the average East Anglian village of five hundred. And the stench! If at<br>rare moments you stop smelling sulphur it is because you have begun<br>smelling gas. Even the shallow river that runs through the town is-usually<br>bright yellow with some chemical or other. Once I halted in the street and<br>counted the factory chimneys I could see; there were thirty-three of them,<br>but there would have been far more if the air had not been obscured by<br>smoke. One scene especially lingers in my mind. A frightful patch of waste<br>ground (somehow, up there, a patch of waste ground attains a squalor that<br>would be impossible even in London) trampled bare of grass and littered<br>with newspapers and old saucepans. To the right an isolated row of gaunt<br>four-roomed houses, dark red, blackened by smoke. To the left an<br>interminable vista of factory chimneys, chimney beyond chimney, fading away<br>into a dim blackish haze. Behind me a railway embankment made of the slag<br>from furnaces. In front, across the patch of waste ground, a cubical<br>building of red and yellow brick, with the sign 'Thomas Grocock, Haulage<br>Contractor'.<br><br>At night, when you cannot see the hideous shapes of the houses and the<br>blackness of everything, a town like Sheffield assumes a kind of sinister<br>magnificence. Sometimes the drifts of smoke are rosy with sulphur, and<br>serrated flames, like circular saws, squeeze themselves out from beneath<br>the cowls of the foundry chimneys. Through the open doors of foundries you<br>see fiery serpents of iron being hauled to and fro by redlit boys, and you<br>hear the whizz and thump of steam hammers and the scream of the iron under<br>the blow. The pottery towns are almost equally ugly in a pettier way. Right<br>in among the rows of tiny blackened houses, part of the street as it were,<br>are the 'pot banks'--conical brick chimneys like gigantic burgundy<br>bottles buried in the soil and belching their smoke almost in your face.<br>You come upon monstrous clay chasms hundreds of feet across and almost as<br>deep, with little rusty tubs creeping on chain railways up one side, and on<br>the other workmen clinging like samphire-gatherers and cutting into the<br>face of the cliff with their picks. I passed that way in snowy weather, and<br>even the snow was black. The best thing one can say for the pottery towns<br>is that they are fairly small and stop abruptly. Less than ten miles away<br>you can stand in un-defiled country, on the almost naked hills, and the<br>pottery towns are only a smudge in the distance.<br><br>When you contemplate such ugliness as this, there are two questions<br>that strike you. First, is it inevitable? Secondly, does it matter?<br><br>I do not believe that there is anything inherently and unavoidably<br>ugly about industrialism. A factory or even a gasworks is not obliged of<br>its own nature to be ugly, any more than a palace or a dog-kennel or a<br>cathedral. It all depends on the architectural tradition of the period. The<br>industrial towns of the North are ugly because they happen to have been<br>built at a time when modem methods of steel-construction and smoke-<br>abatement were unknown, and when everyone was too busy making money to<br>think about anything else. They go on being ugly largely because the<br>Northerners have got used to that kind of thing and do not notice it. Many<br>of the people in Sheffield or Manchester, if they smelled the air along the<br>Cornish cliffs, would probably declare that it had no taste in it. But<br>since the war, industry has tended to shift southward and in doing so has<br>grown almost comely. The typical post-war factory is not a gaunt barrack or<br>an awful chaos of blackness and belching chimneys; it is a glittering white<br>structure of concrete, glass, and steel, surrounded by green lawns and beds<br>of tulips. Look at the factories you pass as you travel out of London on<br>the G.W.R.; they may not be aesthetic triumphs but certainly they are not<br>ugly in the same way as the Sheffield gasworks. But in any case, though the<br>ugliness of industrialism is the most obvious thing about it and the thing<br>every newcomer exclaims against, I doubt whether it is centrally important.<br>And perhaps it is not even desirable, industrialism being what it is, that<br>it should leam to disguise itself as something else. As Mr Aldous Huxley<br>has truly remarked, a dark Satanic mill ought to look like a dark Satanic<br>mill and not like the temple of mysterious and splendid gods. Moreover,<br>even in the worst of the industrial towns one sees a great deal that is not<br>ugly in the narrow aesthetic sense. A belching chimney or a stinking slum<br>is repulsive chiefly because it implies warped lives and ailing children.<br>Look at it from a purely aesthetic standpoint and it may, have a certain<br>macabre appeal. I find that anything outrageously strange generally ends by<br>fascinating me even when I abominate it. The landscapes of Burma, which,<br>when I was among them, so appalled me as to assume the qualities of<br>nightmare, afterwards stayed so hauntingly in my mind that I was obliged to<br>write a novel about them to get rid of them. (In all novels about the East<br>the scenery is the real subject-matter.) It would probably be quite easy to<br>extract a sort of beauty, as Arnold Bennett did, from the blackness of the<br>industrial towns; one can easily imagine Baudelaire, for instance, writing<br>a poem about a slag-heap. But the beauty or ugliness of industrialism<br>hardly matters. Its real evil lies far deeper and is quite uneradicable. It<br>is important to remember this, because there is always a temptation to<br>think that industrialism is harmless so long as it is clean and orderly.<br><br>But when you go to the industrial North you are conscious, quite apart<br>from the unfamiliar scenery, of entering a strange country. This is partly<br>because of certain real differences which do exist, but still more because<br>of the North-South antithesis which has been rubbed into us for such a long<br>time past. There exists in England a curious cult of Northemness, sort of<br>Northern snobbishness. A Yorkshireman in the South will always take care to<br>let you know that he regards you as an inferior. If you ask him why, he<br>will explain that it is only in the North that life is 'real' life, that<br>the industrial work done in the North is the only 'real' work, that the<br>North is inhabited by 'real' people, the South merely by rentiers and their<br>parasites. The Northerner has 'grit', he is grim, 'dour', plucky, warm-<br>hearted, and democratic; the Southerner is snobbish, effeminate, and lazy<br>--that at any rate is the theory. Hence the Southerner goes north, at any<br>rate for the first time, with the vague inferiority-complex of a civilized<br>man venturing among savages, while the Yorkshireman, like the Scotchman,<br>comes to London in the spirit of a barbarian out for loot. And feelings of<br>this kind, which are the result of tradition, are not affected by visible<br>facts. Just as an Englishman five feet four inches high and twenty-nine<br>inches round the chest feels that as an Englishman he is the physical<br>superior of Camera (Camera being a Dago), so also with the Northerner and<br>the Southerner. I remember a weedy little Yorkshireman, who would almost<br>certainly have run away if a fox-terrier had snapped at him, telling me<br>that in the South of England he felt 'like a wild invader'. But the cult is<br>often adopted by people who are not by birth Northerners themselves. A year<br>or two ago a friend of mine, brought up in the South but now living in the<br>North, was driving me through Suffolk in a car. We passed through a rather<br>beautiful village. He glanced disapprovingly at the cottages and said:<br><br><br>'Of course most of the villages in Yorkshire are hideous; but the<br>Yorkshiremen are splendid chaps. Down here it's just the other way about--<br>beautiful villages and rotten people. All the people in those cottages<br>there are worthless, absolutely worthless.'<br><br><br>I could not help inquiring whether he happened to know anybody in that<br>village. No, he did not know them; but because this was East Anglia they<br>were obviously worthless. Another friend of mine, again a Southerner by<br>birth, loses no opportunity of praising the North to the detriment of the<br>South. Here is an extract from one of his letters to me:<br><br><br>I am in Clitheroe, Lanes. ... I think running water is much more<br>attractive in moor and mountain country than in the fat and sluggish South.<br>'The smug and silver Trent,' Shakespeare says; and the South-er the<br>smugger, I say.<br><br><br>Here you have an interesting example of the Northern cult. Not only<br>are you and I and everyone else in the South of England written off as 'fat<br>and sluggish', but even water when it gets north of a certain latitude,<br>ceases to be H2O and becomes something mystically superior. But the<br>interest of this passage is that its writer is an extremely intelligent man<br>of 'advanced' opinions who would have nothing but con-tempt for nationalism<br>in its ordinary form. Put to him some such proposition as 'One Britisher is<br>worth three foreigners', and he would repudiate it with horror. But when it<br>is a question of North versus South, he is quite ready to generalize. All<br>nationalistic distinctions--all claims to be better than somebody else<br>because you have a different-shaped skull or speak a different dialect--<br>are entirely spurious, but they are important so long as people believe in<br>them. There is no doubt about the Englishman's inbred conviction that those<br>who live to the south of him are his inferiors; even our foreign policy is<br>governed by it to some extent. I think, therefore, that it is worth<br>pointing out when and why it came into being.<br><br>When nationalism first became a religion, the English looked at the<br>map, and, noticing that their island lay very high in the Northern<br>Hemisphere, evolved the pleasing theory that the further north you live the<br>more virtuous you become. The histories I was given when I was a little boy<br>generally started off by explaining in the naivest way that a cold climate<br>made people energetic while a hot one made them lazy, and hence the defeat<br>of the Spanish Armada. This nonsense about the superior energy of the<br>English (actually the laziest people in Europe) has been current for at<br>least a hundred years. 'Better is it for us', writes a Quarterly Reviewer<br>of 1827, 'to be condemned to labour for our country's good than to<br>luxuriate amid olives, vines, and vices.' 'Olives, vines, and vices' sums<br>up the normal English attitude towards the Latin races. In the mythology of<br>Garlyle, Creasey, etc., the Northerner ('Teutonic', later 'Nordic') is<br>pictured as a hefty, vigorous chap with blond moustaches and pure morals,<br>while the Southerner is sly, cowardly, and licentious. This theory was<br>never pushed to its logical end, which would have meant assuming that the<br>finest people in the world were the Eskimos, but it did involve admitting<br>that the people who lived to the north of us were superior to ourselves.<br>Hence, partly, the cult of Scotland and of Scotch things which has so<br>deeply marked English life during the past fifty years. But it was the<br>industrialization of the North that gave the North-South antithesis its<br>peculiar slant. Until comparatively recently the northern part of England<br>was the backward and feudal part, and such industry as existed was<br>concentrated in London and the South-East. In the Civil War for instance,<br>roughly speaking a war of money versus feudalism, the North and West were<br>for the King and the South and East for the Parliament. But with the<br>increasing use of coal industry passed to the North, and there grew up a<br>new type of man, the self-made Northern business man--the Mr Rouncewell<br>and Mr Bounderby of Dickens. The Northern business man, with his hateful<br>'get on or get out' philosophy, was the dominant figure of the nineteenth<br>century, and as a sort of tyrannical corpse he rules us still. This is the<br>type edified by Arnold Bennett--the type who starts off with half a crown<br>and ends up with fifty thousand pounds, and whose chief pride is to be an<br>even greater boor after he has made his money than before. On analysis his<br>sole virtue turns out to be a talent for making money. We were bidden to<br>admire him because though he might be narrow-minded, sordid, ignorant,<br>grasping, and uncouth, he had 'grit', he 'got on'; in other words, he knew<br>how to make money.<br><br>This kind of cant is nowadays a pure anachronism, for the Northern<br>business man is no longer prosperous. But traditions are not killed by<br>facts, and the tradition of Northern' grit' lingers. It is still dimly felt<br>that a Northerner will 'get on', i.e. make money, where a Southerner will<br>fail. At the back of the mind of every Yorkshireman and every Scotchman who<br>comes to London is a sort of Dick Whittington picture of himself as the boy<br>who starts off by selling newspapers and ends up as Lord Mayor. And that,<br>really, is at the bottom of his bumptiousness. But where one can make a<br>great mistake is in imagining that this feeling extends to the genuine<br>working class. When I first went to Yorkshire, some years ago, I imagined<br>that I was going to a country of boors. I was used to the London<br>Yorkshireman with his interminable harangues and his pride in the sup-posed<br>raciness of his dialect (' "A stitch in time saves nine", as we say in the<br>West Riding'), and I expected to meet with a good deal of rudeness. But I<br>met with nothing of the kind, and least of all among the miners. Indeed the<br>Lancashire and Yorkshire miners treated me with a kindness and courtesy<br>that were even embarrassing; for if there is one type of man to whom I do<br>feel myself inferior, it is a coal-miner. Certainly no one showed any sign<br>of despising me for coming from a different part of the country. This has<br>its importance when one remembers that the English regional snobberies are<br>nationalism in miniature; for it suggests that place-snobbery is not a<br>working-class characteristic.<br><br>There is nevertheless a real difference between North and South, and<br>there is at least a tinge of truth in that picture of Southern England as<br>one enormous Brighton inhabited by lounge-lizards. For climatic reasons the<br>parasitic divi-dend-drawing class tend to settle in the South. In a<br>Lancashire cotton-town you could probably go for months on end without once<br>hearing an 'educated' accent, whereas there can hardly be a town in the<br>South of England where you could throw a brick without hitting the niece of<br>a bishop. Consequently, with no petty gentry to set the pace, the<br>bourgeoisification of the working class, though it is taking place in the<br>North, is taking place more slowly. All the Northern accents, for instance,<br>persist strongly, while the Southern ones are collapsing before the movies<br>and the B.B.C. Hence your 'educated' accent stamps you rather as a<br>foreigner than as a chunk of the petty gentry; and this is an immense<br>advantage, for it makes it much easier to get into contact with the working<br>class.<br><br>But is it ever possible to be really intimate with the working class?<br>I shall have to discuss that later; I will only say here that I do not<br>think it is possible. But undoubtedly it is easier in the North than it<br>would be in the South to meet working-class people on approximately equal<br>terms. It is fairly easy to live in a miner's house and be accepted as one<br>of the family; with, say, a farm labourer in the Southern counties it<br>probably would be impossible. I have seen just enough of the working class<br>to avoid idealizing them, but I do know that you can leam a great deal in a<br>working-class home, if only you can get there. The essential point is that<br>your middle-class ideals and prejudices are tested by contact with others<br>which are not necessarily better but are certainly different.<br><br>Take for instance the different attitude towards the family. A<br>working-class family hangs together as a middle-class one does, but the<br>relationship is far less tyrannical. A working man has not that deadly<br>weight of family prestige hanging round his neck like a millstone. I have<br>pointed out earlier that a middle-class person goes utterly to pieces under<br>the influence of poverty; and this is generally due to the behaviour of his<br>family--to the fact that he has scores of relations nagging and badgering<br>him night and day for failing to 'get on'. The fact that the working class<br>know how to combine and the middle class don't is probably due to their<br>different conceptions of family loyalty. You cannot have an effective trade<br>union of middle-class workers, be-cause in times of strikes almost every<br>middle-class wife would be egging her husband on to blackleg and get the<br>other fellow's job. Another working-class characteristic, disconcerting at<br>first, is their plain-spokenness towards anyone they regard as an equal. If<br>you offer a working man something he doesn't want, he tells you that he<br>doesn't want it; a middle-class person would accept it to avoid giving<br>offence. And again, take the working-class attitude towards 'education'.<br>How different it is from ours, and how immensely sounder! Working people<br>often have a vague reverence for learning in others, but where 'education'<br>touches their own lives they see through it and reject it by a healthy<br>instinct. The time was when I used to lament over quite imaginary pictures<br>of lads of fourteen dragged protesting from their lessons and set to work<br>at dismal jobs. It seemed to me dreadful that the doom of a 'job' should<br>descend upon anyone at fourteen. Of course I know now that there is not one<br>working-class boy in a thousand who does not pine for the day when he will<br>leave school. He wants to be doing real work, not wasting his time on<br>ridiculous rubbish like history and geography. To the working class, the<br>notion of staying at school till you are nearly grown-up seems merely<br>contemptible and unmanly. The idea of a great big boy of eighteen, who<br>ought to be bringing a pound a week home to his parents, going to school in<br>a ridiculous uniform and even being caned for not doing his lessons! Just<br>fancy a working-class boy of eighteen allowing himself to be caned! He is a<br>man when the other is still a baby. Ernest Pontifex, in Samuel Butler's Way<br>of All Flesh, after he had had a few glimpses of real life, looked back on<br>his public school and university education and found it a 'sickly,<br>debilitating debauch'. There is much in middle-class life that looks sickly<br>and debilitating when you see it from a working-class angle.<br><br>In a working-class home--I am not thinking at the moment of the<br>unemployed, but of comparatively prosperous homes--you breathe a warm,<br>decent, deeply human atmosphere which it is not so easy to find elsewhere.<br>I should say that a manual worker, if he is in steady work and drawing good<br>wages--an 'if which gets bigger and bigger--has a better chance of<br>being happy than an 'educated' man. His home life seems to fall more<br>naturally into a sane and comely shape. I have often been struck by the<br>peculiar easy completeness, the perfect symmetry as it were, of a working-<br>class interior at its best. Especially on winter evenings after tea, when<br>the fire glows in the open range and dances mirrored in the steel fender,<br>when Father, in shirt-sleeves, sits in the rocking chair at one side of the<br>fire reading the racing finals, and Mother sits on the other with her<br>sewing, and the children are happy with a pennorth of mint humbugs, and the<br>dog lolls roasting himself on the rag mat--it is a good place to be in,<br>provided that you can be not only in it but sufficiently of it to be taken<br>for granted.<br><br>This scene is still reduplicated in a majority of English homes,<br>though not in so many as before the war. Its happiness depends mainly upon<br>one question--whether Father is in work. But notice that the picture I<br>have called up, of a working-class family sitting round the coal fire after<br>kippers and strong tea, belongs only to our own moment of time and could<br>not belong either to the future or the past. Skip forward two hundred years<br>into the Utopian future, and the scene is totally different. Hardly one of<br>the things I have imagined will still be there. In that age when there is<br>no manual labour and everyone is 'educated', it is hardly likely that<br>Father will still be a rough man with enlarged hands who likes to sit in<br>shirt-sleeves and says 'Ah wur coomin' oop street'. And there won't be a<br>coal fire in the grate, only some kind of invisible heater. The furniture<br>will be made of rubber, glass, and steel. If there are still such things as<br>evening papers there will certainly be no racing news in them, for gambling<br>will be meaningless in a world where there is no poverty and the horse will<br>have vanished from the face of the earth. Dogs, too, will have been sup-<br>pressed on grounds of hygiene. And there won't be so many children, either,<br>if the birth-controllers have their way. But move backwards into the Middle<br>Ages and you are in a world almost equally foreign. A windowless hut, a<br>wood fire which smokes in your face because there is no chimney, mouldy<br>bread, 'Poor John', lice, scurvy, a yearly child-birth and a yearly child-<br>death, and the priest terrifying you with tales of Hell.<br><br>Curiously enough it is not the triumphs of modem engineering, nor the<br>radio, nor the cinematograph, nor the five thousand novels which are<br>published yearly, nor the crowds at Ascot and the Eton and Harrow match,<br>but the memory of working-class interiors--especially as I sometimes saw<br>them in my childhood before the war, when England was still prosperous--<br>that reminds me that our age has not been altogether a bad one to live in.<br><br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/5.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/7.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
