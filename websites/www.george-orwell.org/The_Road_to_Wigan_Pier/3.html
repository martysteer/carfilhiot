<h2>Chapter 4</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">AS you walk through the industrial towns you lose yourself in labyrinths of<br>little brick houses blackened by smoke, festering in planless chaos round<br>miry alleys and little cindered yards where there are stinking dust-bins<br>and lines of grimy washing and half-ruinous w.c.s. The interiors of these<br>houses are always very much the same, though the number of rooms varies<br>between two or five. All have an almost exactly similar living-room, ten or<br>fifteen feet square, with an open kitchen range; in the larger ones there<br>is a scullery as well, in the smaller ones the sink and copper are in the<br>living-room. At the back there is the yard, or part of a yard shared by a<br>number of houses, just big enough for the dustbin and the w.c.s. Not a<br>single one has hot water laid on. You might walk, I suppose, through<br>literally hundreds of miles of streets inhabited by miners, every one of<br>whom, when he is in work, gets black from head to foot every day, without<br>ever passing a house in which one could have a bath. It would have been<br>very simple to install a hot-water system working from the kitchen range,<br>but the builder saved perhaps ten pounds on each house by not doing so, and<br>at the time when these houses were built no one imagined that miners wanted<br>baths.<br><br>For it is to be noted that the majority of these houses are old, fifty<br>or sixty years old at least, and great numbers of them are by any ordinary<br>standard not fit for human habitation. They go on being tenanted simply<br>because there are no others to be had. And that is the central fact about<br>housing in the industrial areas: not that the houses are poky and ugly, and<br>insanitary and comfortless, or that they are distributed in incredibly<br>filthy slums round belching foundries and stinking canals and slag-heaps<br>that deluge them with sulphurous smoke--though all this is perfectly true<br>--but simply that there are not enough houses to go round.<br><br>'Housing shortage' is a phrase that has been bandied about pretty<br>freely since the war, but it means very little to anyone with an income of<br>more than L10 a week, or even L5 a week for that matter. Where rents are<br>high the difficulty is not to find houses but to find tenants. Walk down<br>any street in Mayfair and you will see 'To Let' boards in half the windows.<br>But in the industrial areas the mere difficulty of getting hold of a house<br>is one of the worst aggravations of poverty. It means that people will put<br>up with anything--any hole and corner slum, any misery of bugs and<br>rotting floors and cracking walls, any extortion of skinflint landlords and<br>blackmailing agents--simply to get a roof over their heads. I have been<br>into appalling houses, houses in which I would not live a week if you paid<br>me, and found that the tenants had been there twenty and thirty years and<br>only hoped they might have the luck to die there. In general these<br>conditions are taken as a matter of course, though not always. Some people<br>hardly seem to realize that such things as decent houses exist and look on<br>bugs and leaking roofs as acts of God; others rail bitterly against their<br>landlords; but all cling desperately to their houses lest worse should<br>befall. So long as the housing shortage continues the local authorities<br>cannot do much to make existing houses more livable. They can 'condemn' a<br>house, but they cannot order it to be pulled down till the tenant has<br>another house to go to; and so the condemned houses remain standing and are<br>all the worse for being condemned, because naturally the landlord will not<br>spend more than he can help on a house which is going to be demolished<br>sooner or later. In a town like Wigan, for instance, there are over two<br>thousand houses standing which have been condemned for years, and whole<br>sections of the town would be condemned en bloc if there were any hope of<br>other houses being built to replace them. Towns like Leeds and Sheffield<br>have scores of thousands of 'back to back' houses which are all of a<br>condemned type but will remain standing for decades.<br><br>I have inspected great numbers of houses in various mining towns and<br>villages and made notes on their essential points. I think I can best give<br>an idea of what conditions are like by transcribing a few extracts from my<br>notebook, taken more or less at random. They are only brief notes and they<br>will need certain explanations which I will give afterwards. Here are a few<br>from Wigan:<br><br><br>1. House in Wallgate quarter. Blind back type. One up, one down.<br>Living-room measures 12 ft by 10 ft, room upstairs the same. Alcove under<br>stairs measuring 5 ft by 5 ft and serving as larder, scullery, and coal-<br>hole. Windows will open. Distance to lavatory 50 yards. Rent 4s. 9d., rates<br>2s. 6d., total 7s. 3d.<br><br>2. Another near by. Measurements as above, but no alcove under<br>stairs, merely a recess two feet deep containing the sink--no room for<br>larder, etc. Rent 3s. 2d., rates 2s., total 5s. 2d.<br><br>3. House in Scholes quarter. Condemned house. One up, one down.<br>Rooms 15 ft by 15 ft. Sink and copper in living-room, coal-hole under<br>stairs. Floor subsiding. No windows will open. House decently dry. Landlord<br>good. Rent 3s. 8d. rates 2s. 6d., total 6s. 2d.<br><br>4. Another near by. Two up, two down, and coal-hole. Walls falling<br>absolutely to pieces. Water comes into upstairs rooms in quantities. Floor<br>lopsided. Downstairs windows will not open. Landlord bad. Rent 6s., rates<br>3s. 6d., total 9s. 6d.<br><br>5. House in Greenough's Row. One up, two down. Living-room 13 ft by<br>8 ft. Walls coming apart and water comes in. Back windows will not open,<br>front ones will. Ten in family with eight children very near together in<br>age. Corporations are trying to evict them for overcrowding but cannot find<br>another house to send them to. Landlord bad. Rent 4s., rates 2s. 3d., total<br>6s. 3d.<br><br><br>So much for Wigan. I have pages more of the same type. Here is one<br>from Sheffield--a typical specimen of Sheffield's several score thousand<br>'back to back' houses:<br><br><br>House in Thomas Street. Back to back, two up, one down (i.e. a<br>three-storey house with one room on each storey). Cellar below. Living-room<br>14 ft by 10 ft, and rooms above corresponding. Sink in living-room. Top<br>floor has no door but gives on open stairs, Walls in living-room slightly<br>damp, walls in top rooms coming to pieces and oozing damp on all sides.<br>House is so dark that light has to be kept burning all day. Electricity<br>estimated at 6d. a day (probably an exaggeration). Six in family, parents<br>and foul children. Husband (on P.A.C.) is tuberculous. One child in<br>hospital, the others appear healthy. Tenants have been seven years in this<br>house. Would move, but no other house available. Rent 6s. 6d., rates<br>included.<br><br><br>Here are one or two from Barnslcy:<br><br><br>1. House in Wortley Street. Two up, one down. Living-room 12 ft by<br>10 ft. Sink and copper in living-room, coal-hole under stairs. Sink worn<br>almost flat and constantly overflowing. Walls not too sound. Penny in slot<br>gas-light. House very dark and gas-light estimated 4d. a day. Upstairs<br>rooms are really one large room partitioned into two. Walls very bad--<br>wall of back room cracked right through. Window-frames coming to pieces and<br>have to be stuffed with wood. Rain comes through in several places. Sewer<br>runs under house and stinks in summer but Corporation 'says they can't do<br>nowt'. Six people in house, two adults and four children, the eldest aged<br>fifteen. Youngest but one attending hospital--tuberculosis suspected.<br>House infested by bugs. Rent 5s. 3d., including rates.<br><br>2. House in Peel Street. Back to back, two up, two down and large<br>cellar. Living-room loft square with copper and sink. The other downstairs<br>room the same size, probably intended as par-lour but used as bedroom.<br>Upstairs rooms the same size as those below. Living-room very dark.<br>Gas-light estimated at 4 1/2d. a day. Distance to lavatory 70 yards. Four<br>beds in house for eight people--two old parents, two adult girls (the<br>eldest aged twenty-seven), one young man, and three children. Parents have<br>one bed, eldest son another, and remaining five people share the other two.<br>Bugs very bad--'You can't keep 'em down when it's 'ot.' Indescribable<br>squalor in downstairs room and smell upstairs almost unbearable. Rent 5s.<br>7 1/2d., including rates.<br><br>3. House in Mapplewell (small mining village near Barnsley). Two<br>up, one down. Living-room 14 ft by 13 ft. Sink in living-room. Plaster<br>cracking and coming off walls. No shelves in oven. Gas leaking slightly.<br>The upstairs rooms each 10 ft by 8 ft. Four beds (for six persons, all<br>adult), but 'one bed does nowt', presumably for lack of bedclothes. Room<br>nearest stairs has no door and stairs have no banister, so that when you<br>step out of bed your foot hangs in vacancy and you may fall ten feet on to<br>stones. Dry rot so bad that one can see through the floor into the room<br>below. Bugs, but 'I keeps 'em down with sheep dip'. Earth road past these<br>cottages is like a muck-heap and said to be almost impassable in winter.<br>Stone lavatories at ends of gardens in semi-ruinous condition. Tenants have<br>been twenty-two years in this house. Are L11 in arrears with rent, and have<br>been paying an extra 1s. a week to pay this off. Landlord now refuses this<br>and has served orders to quit. Rent 5s., including rates.<br><br><br>And so on and so on and so on. I could multiply examples by the score<br>--they could be multiplied by the hundred thousand if anyone chose to make<br>a house-to-house inspection throughout the industrial districts. Meanwhile<br>some of the expressions I have used need explaining. 'One up, one down'<br>means one room on each storey--i.e. a two-roomed house. 'Back to back'<br>houses are two houses built in one, each side of the house being somebody's<br>front door, so that if you walk down a row of what is apparently twelve<br>houses you are in reality seeing not twelve houses but twenty-four. The<br>front houses give on the street and the back ones on the yard, and there is<br>only one way out of each house. The effect of this is obvious. The<br>lavatories are in the yard at the back, so that if you live on the side<br>facing the street, to get to the lavatory or the dust-bin you have to go<br>out of the front door and walk round the end of the block--a distance<br>that may be as much as two hundred yards; if you live at the back, on the<br>other hand, your outlook is on to a row of lavatories. There are also<br>houses of what is called the 'blind back' type, which are single houses,<br>but in which the builder has omitted to put in a back door--from pure<br>spite, apparently. The windows which refuse to open are a peculiarity of<br>old mining towns. Some of these towns are so undermined by ancient workings<br>that the ground is constantly subsiding and the houses above slip sideways.<br>In Wigan you pass whole rows of houses which have slid to startling angles,<br>their windows being ten or twenty degrees out of the horizontal. Sometimes<br>the front wall bellies outward till it looks as though the house were seven<br>months gone in pregnancy. It can be refaced, but the new facing soon begins<br>to bulge again. When a house sinks at all suddenly its windows are jammed<br>for ever and the door has to be refitted. This excites no surprise locally.<br>The story of the miner who comes home from work and finds that he can only<br>get indoors by smashing down the front door with an axe is considered<br>humorous. In some cases I have noted 'Landlord good' or 'Landlord bad',<br>because there is great variation in what the slum-dwellers say about their<br>landlords. I found--one might expect it, perhaps--that the small<br>landlords are usually the worst. It goes against the grain to say this, but<br>one can see why it should be so. Ideally, the worst type of slum landlord<br>is a fat wicked man, preferably a bishop, who is drawing an immense income<br>from extortionate rents. Actually, it is a poor old woman who has invested<br>her life's savings in three slum houses, inhabits one of them, and tries to<br>live on the rent of the other two--never, in consequence, having any<br>money for repairs.<br><br>But mere notes like these are only valuable as reminders to myself. To<br>me as I read them they bring back what I have seen, but they cannot in<br>themselves give much idea of what conditions are like in those fearful<br>northern slums. Words are such feeble things. What is the use of a brief<br>phrase like 'roof leaks' or 'four beds for eight people'? It is the kind of<br>thing your eye slides over, registering nothing. And yet what a wealth of<br>misery it can cover! Take the question of overcrowding, for instance. Quite<br>often you have eight or even ten people living in a three-roomed house. One<br>of these rooms is a living-room, and as it probably measures about a dozen<br>feet square and contains, besides the kitchen range and the sink, a table,<br>some chairs, and a dresser, there is no room in it for a bed. So there are<br>eight or ten people sleeping in two small rooms, probably in at most four<br>beds. If some of these people are adults and have to go to work, so much<br>the worse. In one house, I remember, three grown-up girls shared the same<br>bed and all went to work at different hours, each disturbing the others<br>when she got up or came in; in another house a young miner working on the<br>night shift slept by day in a narrow bed in which another member of the<br>family slept by night. There is an added difficulty when there are grown-up<br>children, in that you cannot let adolescent youths and girls sleep in the<br>same bed. In one family I visited there were a father and mother and a son<br>and daughter aged round about seventeen, and only two beds for the lot of<br>them. The father slept with the son and the mother with the daughter; it<br>was the only arrangement that ruled out the danger of incest. Then there is<br>the misery of leaking roofs and oozing walls, which in winter makes some<br>rooms almost uninhabitable. Then there are bugs. Once bugs get into a house<br>they are in it till the crack of doom; there is no sure way of<br>exterminating them. Then there are the windows that will not open. I need<br>not point out what this must mean, in summer, in a tiny stuffy living-room<br>where the fire, on which all the cooking is done, has to be kept burning<br>more or less constantly. And there are the special miseries attendant upon<br>back to back houses. A fifty yards' walk to the lavatory or the dust-bin is<br>not exactly an inducement to be clean. In the front houses--at any rate<br>in a side-street where the Corporation don't interfere--the women get<br>into the habit of throwing their refuse out of the front door, so that the<br>gutter is always littered with tea-leaves and bread crusts. And it is worth<br>considering what it is like for a child to grow up in one of the back<br>alleys where its gaze is bounded by a row of lavatories and a wall.<br><br>In such places as these a woman is only a poor drudge muddling among<br>an infinity of jobs. She may keep up her spirits, but she cannot keep up<br>her standards of cleanliness and tidiness. There is always something to be<br>done, and no conveniences and almost literally not room to turn round. No<br>sooner have you washed one child's face than another's is dirty; before you<br>have washed the crocks from one meal the next is due to be cooked. I found<br>great variation in the houses I visited. Some were as decent as one could<br>possibly expect in the circumstances, some were so appalling that I have no<br>hope of describing them adequately. To begin with, the smell, the dominant<br>and essential thing, is indescribable. But the squalor and the confusion! A<br>tub full of filthy water here, a basin full of unwashed crocks there, more<br>crocks piled in any odd corner, torn newspaper littered everywhere, and in<br>the middle always the same dreadful table covered with sticky oilcloth and<br>crowded with cooking pots and irons and half-darned stockings and pieces of<br>stale bread and bits of cheese wrapped round with greasy newspaper! And the<br>congestion in a tiny room where getting from one side to the other is a<br>complicated voyage between pieces of furniture, with a line of damp washing<br>getting you in the face every time you move and the children as thick<br>underfoot as toadstools! There are scenes that stand out vividly in my<br>memory. The almost bare living-room of a cottage in a little mining<br>village, where the whole family was out of work and everyone seemed to be<br>underfed; and the big family of grown-up sons and daughters sprawling<br>aimlessly about, all strangely alike with red hair, splendid bones, and<br>pinched faces ruined by malnutrition and idleness; and one tall son sitting<br>by the fire-place, too listless even to notice the entry of a stranger, and<br>slowly peeling a sticky sock from a bare foot. A dreadful room in Wigan<br>where all the furniture seemed to be made of packing cases and barrel<br>staves and was coming to pieces at that; and an old woman with a blackened<br>neck and her hair coining down denouncing her landlord in a Lancashire-<br>Irish accent; and her mother, aged well over ninety, sitting in the<br>background on the barrel that served her as a commode and regarding us<br>blankly with a yellow, cretinous face. I could fill up pages with memories<br>of similar interiors.<br><br>Of course the squalor of these people's houses is some-times their own<br>fault. Even if you live in a back to back house and have four children and<br>a total income of thirty-two and sixpence a week from the P.A.C., there is<br>no need to have unemptied chamber-pots standing about in your living-room.<br>But it is equally certain that their circumstances do not encourage self-<br>respect. The determining factor is probably the number of children. The<br>best-kept interiors I saw were always childless houses or houses where<br>there were only one or two children; with, say, six children in a three-<br>roomed house it is quite impossible to keep anything decent. One thing that<br>is very noticeable is that the worst squalors are never downstairs. You<br>might visit quite a number of houses, even among the poorest of the<br>unemployed, and bring away a wrong impression. These people, you might<br>reflect, cannot be so badly off if they still have a fair amount of<br>furniture and crockery. But it is in the rooms upstairs that the gauntness<br>of poverty really discloses itself. Whether this is because pride makes<br>people cling to their living-room furniture to the last, or because bedding<br>is more pawnable, I do not know, but certainly many of the bedrooms I saw<br>were fearful places. Among people who have been unemployed for several<br>years continuously I should say it is the exception to have anything like a<br>full set of bedclothes. Often there is nothing that can be properly called<br>bedclothes at all--just a heap of old overcoats and miscellaneous rags on<br>a rusty iron bedstead. In this way overcrowding is aggravated. One family<br>of four persons that I knew, a father and mother and two children,<br>possessed two beds but could only use one of them because they had not<br>enough bedding for the other.<br><br>Anyone who wants to see the effects of the housing shortage at their<br>very worse should visit the dreadful caravan-dwellings that exist in<br>numbers in many of the northern towns. Ever since the war, in the complete<br>impossibility of getting houses, parts of the population have overflowed<br>into supposedly temporary quarters in fixed caravans. Wigan, for instance,<br>with a population of about 85,000, has round about 200 caravan-dwellings<br>with a family in each--perhaps somewhere near 1000 people in all. How<br>many of these caravan-colonies exist throughout the industrial areas it<br>would be difficult to discover with any accuracy. The local authorities are<br>reticent about them and the census report of 1931 seems to have decided to<br>ignore them. But so far as I can discover by inquiry they are to be found<br>in most of the larger towns in Lancashire and Yorkshire, and perhaps<br>further north as well. The probability is that throughout the north of<br>England there are some thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of families<br>(not individuals) who have no home except a fixed caravan.<br><br>But the word 'caravan' is very misleading. It calls up a picture of a<br>cosy gypsy-encampment (in fine weather, of course) with wood fires<br>crackling and children picking blackberries and many-coloured washing<br>fluttering on the lines. The caravan-colonies in Wigan and Sheffield are<br>not like that. I had a look at several of them, I inspected those in Wigan<br>with considerable care, and I have never seen comparable squalor except in<br>the Far East. Indeed when I saw them I was immediately reminded of the<br>filthy kennels in which I have seen Indian coolies living in Burma. But, as<br>a matter of fact, nothing in the East could ever be quite as bad, for in<br>the East you haven't our clammy, penetrating cold to contend with, and the<br>sun is a disinfectant.<br><br>Along the banks of Wigan's miry canal are patches of waste ground on<br>which the caravans have been dumped like rubbish shot out of a bucket. Some<br>of them are actually gypsy caravans, but very old ones and in bad repair.<br>The majority are old single-decker buses (the rather smaller buses of ten<br>years ago) which have been taken off their wheels and propped up with<br>struts of wood. Some are simply wagons with semi-circular slats on top,<br>over which canvas is stretched, so that the people inside have nothing but<br>canvas between them and the outer air. Inside, these places are usually<br>about five feet wide by six high (I could not stand quite upright in any of<br>them) and anything from six to fifteen feet long. Some, I suppose, are<br>inhabited by only one person, but I did not see any that held less than two<br>persons, and some of them contained large families. One, for instance,<br>measuring fourteen feet long, had seven people in it--seven people in<br>about 450 cubic feet of space; which is to say that each person had for his<br>entire dwelling a space a good deal smaller than one compartment of a<br>public lavatory. The dirt and congestion of these places is such that you<br>cannot well imagine it unless you have tested it with your own eyes and<br>more particularly your nose. Each contains a tiny cottage kitchener and<br>such furniture as can be crammed in--sometimes two beds, more usually<br>one, into which the whole family have to huddle as best they can. It is<br>almost impossible to sleep on the floor, because the damp soaks up from<br>below. I was shown mat-tresses which were still wringing wet at eleven in<br>the morning. In winter it is so cold that the kitcheners have to be kept<br>burning day and night, and the windows, need-less to say, are never opened.<br>Water is got from a hydrant common to the whole colony, some of the<br>caravan-dwellers having to walk 150 or 200 yards for every bucket of water.<br>There are no sanitary arrangements at all. Most of the people construct a<br>little hut to serve as a lavatory on the tiny patch of ground surrounding<br>their caravan, and once a week dig a deep hole in which to bury the refuse.<br>All the people I saw in these places, especially the children, were<br>unspeakably dirty, and I do not doubt that they were lousy as well. They<br>could not possibly be otherwise. The thought that haunted me as I went from<br>caravan to caravan was, What can happen in those cramped interiors when<br>anybody dies? But that, of course, is the kind of question you hardly care<br>to ask.<br><br>Some of the people have been in their caravans for many years.<br>Theoretically the Corporation are doing away with the caravan-colonies and<br>getting the inhabitants out into houses; but as the houses don't get built,<br>the caravans remain standing. Most of the people I talked to had given up<br>the idea of ever getting a decent habitation again. They were all out of<br>work, and a job and a house seemed to them about equally remote and<br>impossible. Some hardly seemed to care; others realized quite clearly in<br>what misery they were living. One woman's face stays by me, a worn skull-<br>like face on which was a look of intolerable misery and degradation. I<br>gathered that in that dreadful pigsty, struggling to keep her large brood<br>of children clean, she felt as I should feel if I were coated all over with<br>dung. One must remember that these people are not gypsies; they are decent<br>English people who have all, except the children born there, had homes of<br>their own in their day; besides, their caravans are greatly inferior to<br>those of gypsies and they have not the great advantage of being on the<br>move. No doubt there are still middle-class people who think that the Lower<br>Orders don't mind that kind of thing and who, if they happened to pass a<br>caravan-colony in the train, would immediately assume that the people lived<br>there from choice. I never argue nowadays with that kind of person. But it<br>is worth noticing that the caravan-dwellers don't even save money by living<br>there, for they are paying about the same rents as they would for houses. I<br>could not hear of any rent lower than five shillings a week (five shillings<br>for 200 cubic feet of space!) and there are even cases where the rent is as<br>high as ten shillings. Somebody must be making a good thing out of those<br>caravans! But dearly their continued existence is due to the housing<br>shortage and not directly to poverty.<br><br>Talking once with a miner I asked him. when the housing shortage first<br>became acute in his district; he answered, 'When we were told about it',<br>meaning that till recently people's standards were so low that they took<br>almost any degree of overcrowding for granted. He added that when he was a<br>child his family had slept eleven in a room and thought nothing of it, and<br>that later, when he was grown-up, he and his wife had lived in one of the<br>old-style back to back houses in which you not only had to walk a couple of<br>hundred yards to the lavatory but often had to wait in a queue when you got<br>there, the lavatory being shared by thirty-six people. And when his wife<br>was sick with the illness that killed her, she still had to make that two<br>hundred yards' journey to the lavatory. This, he said, was the kind of<br>thing people would put up with 'till they were told about it'.<br><br>I do not know whether that is true. What is certain is that nobody now<br>thinks it bearable to sleep eleven in a room, and that even people with<br>comfortable incomes are vaguely troubled by the thought of 'the slums'.<br>Hence the clatter about 'rehousing' and 'slum clearance' which we have had<br>at intervals ever since the war. Bishops, politicians, philanthropists, and<br>what not enjoy talking piously about 'slum clearance', because they can<br>thus divert attention from more serious evils and pretend that if you<br>abolish the slums you abolish poverty. But all this talk has led to<br>surprisingly small results. So far as one can discover, the congestion is<br>no better, perhaps slightly worse, than it was a dozen years ago. There is<br>certainly great variation in the speed at which the different towns are<br>attacking their housing problem. In some towns building seems to be almost<br>at a standstill, in others it is proceeding rapidly and the private<br>landlord is being driven out of business. Liver-pool, for instance, has<br>been very largely rebuilt, mainly by the efforts of the Corporation.<br>Sheffield, too, is being torn down and rebuilt pretty fast, though perhaps,<br>considering the unparalleled beastliness of its slums, not quite fast<br>enough.[The number of Corporation houses in process of construction in<br>Sheffield at the beginning of 1936 was 1398. To replace the slum areas<br>entirely Sheffield is said to need 100,000 houses.]<br><br>Why rehousing has on the whole moved so slowly, and why some towns can<br>borrow money for building purposes so much more easily than others, I do<br>not know. Those questions would have to be answered by someone who knows<br>more about the machinery of local government than I do. A Corporation house<br>costs normally somewhere between three and four hundred pounds; it costs<br>rather less when it is built by 'direct labour' than when built by<br>contract. The rent of these houses would average something over twenty<br>pounds a year not counting rates, so one would think that, even allowing<br>for overhead expenses and interest on loans, it would pay any Corporation<br>to build as many houses as could be tenanted. In many cases, of course, the<br>houses would have to be inhabited by people on the P.A.C., so that the<br>local bodies would merely be taking money out of one pocket and putting it<br>into another--i.e. paying out money in the form of relief and taking it<br>back in the form of rent. But they have got to pay the relief in any case,<br>and at present a proportion of what they pay is being swallowed up by<br>private landlords. The reasons given for the slow rate of building are lack<br>of money and the difficulty of getting hold of sites--for Corporation<br>houses are not erected piecemeal but in 'estates', sometimes of hundreds of<br>houses at a time. One thing that always strikes me as mysterious is that so<br>many of the northern towns see fit to build themselves immense and<br>luxurious public buildings at the same time as they are in crying need of<br>dwelling houses. The town of Barnsley, for instance, recently spent close<br>on L150,000 on a new town hall, although admittedly needing at least 2000<br>new working-class houses, not to mention public baths. (The public baths in<br>Barnsley contain nineteen men's slipper baths--this in a town of 70,000<br>inhabitants, largely miners, not one of whom has a bath in his house!) For<br>L150,000 it could have built 350 Corporation houses and still had L10,000<br>to spend on a town hall. However, as I say, I do not pretend to understand<br>the mysteries of local government. I merely record the fact that houses are<br>desperately needed and are being built, on the whole, with paralytic<br>slowness.<br><br>Still, houses are being built, and the Corporation building estates,<br>with their row upon row of little red houses, all much liker than two. peas<br>(where did that expression come from? Peas have great individuality) are a<br>regular feature of the outskirts of the industrial towns. As to what they<br>are like and how they compare with the slum houses, I can best give an idea<br>by transcribing two more extracts from my diary. The tenants' opinions of<br>their houses vary greatly, so I will give one favourable extract and one<br>unfavourable. Both of these are from Wigan and both are the cheaper 'non-<br>parlour type' houses:<br><br><br>1. House in Beech Hill Estate.<br><br>Downstairs. Large living-room with kitchener fireplace, cup-boards,<br>and fixed dresser, composition floor. Small hallway, largish kitchen. Up to<br>date electric cooker hired from Corporation at much the same rate as a gas<br>cooker.<br><br>Upstairs. Two largish bedrooms, one tiny one--suitable only for a<br>boxroom or temporary bedroom. Bathroom, w.c., with hot and cold water.<br><br>Smallish garden. These vary throughout the estate, but mostly<br>rather smaller than an allotment.<br><br>Four in family, parents and two children. Husband in good employ.<br>Houses appear well built and are quite agreeable to look at. Various<br>restrictions, e.g. it is forbidden to keep poultry or pigeons, take in<br>lodgers, sub-let, or start any kind of business with-out leave from the<br>Corporation. (This is easily granted in the case of taking in lodgers, but<br>not in any of the others.) Tenant' very well satisfied with house and proud<br>of it. Houses in this estate all well kept. Corporation are good about<br>repairs, but keep tenants up to the mark with regard to keeping the place<br>tidy, etc.<br><br>Rent 11s. 3d. including rates. Bus fare into town 2d.<br><br><br>2. House in Welly Estate.<br><br>Downstairs. Living-room 14 ft by 10 ft, kitchen a good deal<br>smaller, tiny larder under stairs, small but fairly good bathroom. Gas<br>cooker, electric lighting. Outdoor w.c.<br><br>Upstairs. One bedroom 12 ft by 10 ft with tiny fireplace, another<br>the same size without fireplace, another 7 ft by 6 ft. Best bedroom has<br>small wardrobe let into wall. 'Garden about 20 yards by 10.<br><br>Six in family, parents and four children, eldest son nineteen,<br>eldest daughter twenty-two. None in work except eldest son. Tenants very<br>discontented. Their complaints are: 'House is cold, draughty, and damp.<br>Fireplace in living-room gives out no heat and makes room very dusty--<br>attributed to its being set too low. Fireplace in best bedroom too small to<br>be of any use. Walls upstairs cracking. Owing to uselessness of tiny<br>bedroom, five are sleeping in one bedroom, one (the eldest son) in the<br>other.'<br><br>Gardens in this estate all neglected.<br><br>Rent 10s. 3d., inclusive. Distance to town a little over a mile--<br>there is no bus here.<br><br><br>I could multiply examples, but these two are enough, as the types of<br>Corporation houses being built do not vary greatly from place to place. Two<br>things are immediately obvious. The first is that at their very worst the<br>Corporation houses are better than the slums they replace. The mere<br>possession of a bathroom and a bit of garden would out-weigh almost any<br>disadvantage. The other is that they are much more expensive to live in. It<br>is common enough for a man to be turned out of a condemned house where he<br>is paying six or seven shillings a week and given a Corporation house where<br>he has to pay ten. This only affects those who are in work or have recently<br>been in work, because when a man is on the P.A.C. his rent is assessed at a<br>quarter of his dole, and if it is more than this he gets an extra<br>allowance; in any case, there are certain classes of Corporation houses to<br>which people on the dole are not admitted. But there are other ways in<br>which life in a Corporation estate is expensive, whether you are in work or<br>out of it. To begin with, owing to the higher rents, the shops in the<br>estate are much more expensive and there are not so many of them. Then<br>again, in a comparatively large, detached house, away from the frowsy<br>huddle of the slum, it is much colder and more fuel has to be burnt. And<br>again there is the expense, especially for a man in work, of getting to and<br>from town. This last is one of the more obvious problems of rehousing. Slum<br>clearance means diffusion of the population. When you rebuild on a large<br>scale, what you do in effect is to scoop out the centre of the town and<br>redistribute it on the outskirts. This is all very well in a way; you have<br>got the people out of fetid alleys into places where they have room to<br>breathe; but from the point of view of the people themselves, what you have<br>done is to pick them up and dump them down five miles from their work. The<br>simplest solution is flats. If people are going to live in large towns at<br>all they must learn to live on top of one another. But the northern working<br>people do not take kindly to flats; even where fiats exist they are<br>contemptuously named 'tenements'. Almost everyone will tell you that he<br>'wants a house of his own', and apparently a house in the middle of an<br>unbroken block of houses a hundred yards long seems to them more 'their<br>own' than a flat situated in mid-air.<br><br>To revert to the second of the two Corporation houses I have just<br>mentioned. The tenant complained that the house was cold, damp, and so<br>forth. Perhaps the house was jerry-built, but equally probably he was<br>exaggerating. He had come there from a filthy hovel in the middle of Wigan<br>which I happened to have inspected previously; while there he had made<br>every effort to get hold of a Corporation house, and he was no sooner in<br>the Corporation house than he wanted to be back in the slum. This looks<br>like mere captiousness but it covers a perfectly genuine grievance. In very<br>many cases, perhaps in half the cases, I found that the people in<br>Corporation houses don't really like them. They are glad to get out of the<br>stink of the slum, they know that it is better for their children to have<br>space to play about in, but they don't feel really at home. The exceptions<br>are usually people in good employ who can afford to spend a little extra on<br>fuel and furniture and journeys, and who in any case are of 'superior'<br>type. The others, the typical slum-dwellers, miss the frowsy warmth of the<br>slum. They complain that 'out in the country', i.e. on the edge of the<br>town, they are 'starving' (freezing). Certainly most Corporation estates<br>are pretty bleak in winter. Some I have been through, perched on treeless<br>clayey hillsides and swept by icy winds, would be horrible places to live<br>in. It is not that slum-dwellers want dirt and congestion for their own<br>sakes, as the fat-bellied bourgeoisie love to believe. (See for instance<br>the conversation about slum-clearance in Galsworthy's Swan Song, where the<br>rentier's cherished belief that the slum-dweller makes the slum, and not<br>vice versa, is put into the mouth of a philanthropic Jew.) Give people a<br>decent house and they will soon learn to keep it decent. Moreover, with a<br>smart-looking house to live up to they improve in self-respect and<br>cleanliness, and their children start life with better chances.<br>Nevertheless, in a Corporation estate there is an uncomfortable, almost<br>prison-like atmosphere, and the people who live there are perfectly well<br>aware of it.<br><br>And it is here that one comes on the central difficulty of the housing<br>problem. When you walk through the smoke-dim slums of Manchester you think<br>that nothing is needed except to tear down these abominations and build<br>decent houses in their place. But the trouble is that in destroying the<br>slum you destroy other things as well. Houses are I' desperately needed and<br>are not being built fast enough; but in so far as rehousing is being done,<br>it is being done--perhaps it is unavoidable--in a monstrously inhuman<br>'manner. I don't mean merely that the houses are new and ugly. All houses<br>have got to be new at some time, and as a matter of fact the type of<br>Corporation house now being built is not at all offensive to look at. On<br>the outskirts of Liverpool there are what amount to whole towns consisting<br>entirely of Corporation houses, and they are quite pleasing to the eye; the<br>blocks of workers' flats in the centre of the town modelled, I believe, on<br>the workers' flats in Vienna, are definitely fine buildings. But there is<br>something ruthless and soulless about the whole business. Take, for<br>instance, the restrictions with which you are burdened in a Corporation<br>house. You are not allowed to keep your house and garden as you want them<br>--in some estates there is even a regulation that every garden must have<br>the same kind of hedge. You are not allowed to keep poultry or pigeons. The<br>Yorkshire miners are fond of keeping homer pigeons; they keep them in the<br>back yard and take them out and race them on Sundays. But pigeons are messy<br>birds and the Corporation suppresses them as a matter of course. The<br>restrictions about shops are more serious. The number of shops in a<br>Corporation estate is rigidly limited, and it is said that preference is<br>given to the Co-op and the chain stores; this may not be strictly true, but<br>certainly those are the shops that one usually sees there. This is bad<br>enough for the general public, but from the point of view of the<br>independent shopkeeper it is a disaster. Many a small shopkeeper is utterly<br>ruined by some rehousing scheme which takes no notice of his existence. A<br>whole section of the town is condemned en bloc; presently the houses are<br>pulled down and the people are transferred to some housing estate miles<br>away. In this way all the small shopkeepers of the quarter have their whole<br>clientele taken away from them at a single swoop and receive not a penny of<br>compensation. They cannot transfer their business to the estate, because<br>even if they can afford the move and the much higher rents, they would<br>probably be refused a licence. As for pubs, they are banished from the<br>housing estates almost completely, and the few that remain are dismal sham-<br>Tudor places fitted out by the big brewery companies and very expensive.<br>For a middle-class population this would be a nuisance--it might mean<br>walking a mile to get a glass of beer; for a working-class population,<br>which uses the pub as a kind of club, it is a serious blow at communal<br>life. It is a great achievement to get slum-dwellers into decent houses,<br>but it is unfortunate that, owing to the peculiar temper of our time, it is<br>also considered necessary to rob them of the last vestiges of their<br>liberty. The people themselves feel this, and it is this feeling that they<br>are rationalizing when they complain that their new houses--so much better,<br>as houses, than those they have come out of--are cold and uncomfortable and<br>'unhomelike'.<br><br>I sometimes think that the price of liberty is not so much eternal<br>vigilance as eternal dirt. There are some Corporation estates in which new<br>tenants are systematically de-loused before being allowed into their<br>houses. All their possessions except what they stand up in are taken away<br>from them, fumigated, and sent on to the new house. This procedure has its<br>points, for it is a pity that people should take bugs into brand new houses<br>(a bug will follow you about in your luggage if he gets half a chance), but<br>it is the kind of thing that makes you wish that the word 'hygiene' could<br>be dropped out of the dictionary. Bugs are bad, but a state of affairs in<br>which men will allow themselves to be dipped like sheep is worse. 'Perhaps,<br>however, when it is a case of slum clearance, one must take for granted a<br>certain amount of restrictions and inhumanity. When all is said and done,<br>the most important thing is that people shall live in decent houses and not<br>in pigsties. I have seen too much of slums to go into Chestertonian<br>raptures about them. A place where the children can breathe clean air, and<br>women have a few conveniences to save them from drudgery, and a man has a<br>bit of garden to dig in, must be better than the stinking back-streets of<br>Leeds and Sheffield. On balance, the Corporation Estates are better than<br>the slums; but only by a small margin.<br><br>When I was looking into the housing question I visited and inspected<br>numbers of houses, perhaps a hundred or two hundred houses altogether, in<br>various mining towns and villages. I cannot end this chapter without<br>remarking on the extraordinary courtesy and good nature with which I was<br>received everywhere. I did not go alone--I always had some local friend<br>among the unemployed to show me round--but even so, it is an impertinence<br>to go poking into strangers' houses and asking to see the cracks in the<br>bedroom wall. Yet everyone was astonishingly patient and seemed to<br>understand almost without explanation why I was questioning them and what I<br>wanted to see. If any unauthorized person walked into my house and began<br>asking me whether the roof leaked and whether I was much troubled by bugs<br>and what I thought of my landlord, I should probably tell him to go to<br>hell. This only happened to me once, and in that case the woman was<br>slightly deaf and took me for a Means Test nark; but even she relented<br>after a while and gave me the information I wanted.<br><br>I am told that it is bad form for a writer to quote his own reviews,<br>but I want here to contradict a reviewer in the Manchester Guardian who<br>says apropos of one of my books:<br><br><br>Set down in Wigan or Whitechapel Mr Orwell would still exercise an<br>unerring power of closing his vision to all that is good in order to<br>proceed with his wholehearted vilification of humanity.<br><br><br>Wrong. Mr Orwell was 'set down' in Wigan for quite a while and it did<br>not inspire him with any wish to vilify humanity. He liked Wigan very much<br>--the people, not the scenery. Indeed, he has only one fault to find with<br>it, and that is in respect of the celebrated Wigan Pier, which he had set<br>his heart on seeing. Alas! Wigan Pier had been demolished, and even the<br>spot where it used to stand is no longer certain. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/2.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/4.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
