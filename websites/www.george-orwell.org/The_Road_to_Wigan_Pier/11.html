<h2>Chapter 12</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">However, there is a much more serious difficulty than the local and<br>temporary objections which I discussed in the last chapter.<br><br>Faced by the fact that intelligent people are so often on the other<br>side, the Socialist is apt to set it down to corrupt motives (conscious or<br>unconscious), or to an ignorant belief that Socialism would not 'work', or<br>to a mere dread of the horrors and discomforts of the revolutionary period<br>before Socialism is established. Undoubtedly all these are important, but<br>there are plenty of people who are influenced by none of them and are<br>nevertheless hostile to Socialism. Their reason for recoiling from<br>Socialism is spiritual, or 'ideological'. They object to it not on the<br>ground that it would not 'work', but precisely because it would 'work' too<br>well. What they are afraid of is not the things that are going to happen in<br>their own lifetime, but the things that are going to happen in a remote<br>future when Socialism is a reality.<br><br>I have very seldom met a convinced Socialist who could grasp that<br>thinking people may be repelled by the objective towards which Socialism<br>appears to be moving. The Marxist, especially, dismisses this kind of thing<br>as bourgeois sentimentality. Marxists as a rule are not very good at<br>reading the minds of their adversaries; if they were, the situation in<br>Europe might be less desperate than it is at present. Possessing a<br>technique which seems to explain everything, they do not often bother to<br>discover what is going on inside other people's heads. Here, for instance,<br>is an illustration of the kind of thing I mean. Discussing the widely held<br>theory--which in one sense is certainly true--that Fascism is a product<br>of Communism, Mr N. A. Holdaway, one of the ablest Marxist writers we<br>possess, writes as follows:<br><br><br>The hoary legend of Communism leading to Fascism. ... The element<br>of truth in it is this: that the appearance of Communist activity warns the<br>ruling class that democratic Labour Parties are no longer capable of<br>holding the working class in check, and that capitalist dictatorship must<br>assume another form if it is to survive.<br><br><br>You see here the defects of the method. Because he has detected the<br>underlying economic cause of Fascism, he tacitly assumes that the spiritual<br>side of it is of no importance. Fascism is written off as a manoeuvre of<br>the 'ruling class', which at bottom it is. But this in itself would only<br>explain why Fascism appeals to capitalists. What about the millions who are<br>not capitalists, who in a material sense have nothing to gain from Fascism<br>and are often aware of it, and who, nevertheless, are Fascists? Obviously<br>their approach has been purely along the ideological line. They could only<br>be stampeded into Fascism because Communism attacked or seemed to attack<br>certain things (patriotism, religion, etc.) which lay deeper than the<br>economic motive; and in that sense it is perfectly true that Communism<br>leads to Fascism. It is a pity that Marxists nearly always concentrate on<br>letting economic cats out of ideological bags; it does in one sense reveal<br>the truth, but with this penalty, that most of their propaganda misses its<br>mark. It is the spiritual recoil from Socialism, especially as it manifests<br>itself in sensitive people, that I want to discuss in this chapter. I shall<br>have to analyse it at some length, because it is very widespread, very<br>powerful, and, among Socialists, almost completely ignored.<br><br>The first thing to notice is that the idea of Socialism is bound up,<br>more or less inextricably, with the idea of machine-production. Socialism<br>is essentially an urban creed. It grew up more or less concurrently with<br>industrialism, it has always had its roots in the town proletariat and the<br>town intellectual, and it is doubtful whether it could ever have arisen in<br>any but an industrial society. Granted industrialism, the idea of Socialism<br>presents itself naturally, because private ownership is only tolerable when<br>every individual (or family or other unit) is at least moderately self-<br>supporting; but the effect of industrialism is to make it impossible for<br>anyone to be self-supporting even for a moment. Industrialism, once it<br>rises above a fairly low level, must lead to some form of collectivism. Not<br>necessarily to Socialism, of course; conceivably it might lead to the<br>Slave-State of which Fascism is a kind of prophecy. And the converse is<br>also true. Machine-production suggests Socialism, but Socialism as a world-<br>system implies machine-production, because it demands certain things not<br>compatible with a primitive way of life. It demands, for instance, constant<br>intercommunication and exchange of goods between all parts of the earth; it<br>demands some degree of centralized control; it demands an approximately<br>equal standard of life for all human beings and probably a certain<br>uniformity of education. We may take it, therefore, that any world in which<br>Socialism was a reality would be at least as highly mechanized as the<br>United States at this moment, probably much more so. In any case, no<br>Socialist would think of denying this. The Socialist world is always<br>pictured as a completely mechanized, immensely organized world, depending<br>on the machine as the civilizations of antiquity depend on the slave.<br><br>So far so good, or so bad. Many, perhaps a majority, of thinking<br>people are not in love with machine-civilization, but everyone who is not a<br>fool knows that it is nonsense to talk at this moment about scrapping the<br>machine. But the unfortunate thing is that Socialism, as usually presented,<br>is bound up with the idea of mechanical progress, not merely as a necessary<br>development but as an end in itself, almost as a kind of religion. This<br>idea is implicit in, for instance, most of the propagandist stuff that is<br>written about the rapid mechanical advance in Soviet Russia (the Dneiper<br>dam, tractors, etc., etc.). Karel Capek hits it off well enough in the<br>horrible ending of R.U.R., when the Robots, having slaughtered the last<br>human being, announce their intention to 'build many houses' (just for the<br>sake of building houses, you see). The kind of person who most readily<br>accepts Socialism is also the kind of person who views mechanical progress,<br>as such, with enthusiasm. And this is so much the case that Socialists are<br>often unable to grasp that the opposite opinion exists. As a rule the most<br>persuasive argument they can think of is to tell you that the present<br>mechanization of the world is as nothing to what we shall see when<br>Socialism is established. Where there is one aeroplane now, in those days<br>there will be fifty! All the work that is now done by hand will then be<br>done by machinery: everything that is now made of leather, wood, or stone<br>will be made of rubber, glass, or steel; there will be no disorder, no<br>loose ends, no wilder-nesses, no wild animals, no weeds, no disease, no<br>poverty, no pain--and so on and so forth. The Socialist world is to be<br>above all things an ordered world, an efficient world. But it is precisely<br>from that vision of the future as a sort of glittering Wells-world that<br>sensitive minds recoil. Please notice that this essentially fat-bellied<br>version of 'progress' is not an integral part of Socialist doctrine; but it<br>has come to be thought of as one, with the result that the temperamental<br>conservatism which is latent in all kinds of people is easily mobilized<br>against Socialism.<br><br>Every sensitive person has moments when he is suspicious of machinery<br>and to some extent of physical science. But it is important to sort out the<br>various motives, which have differed greatly at different times, for<br>hostility to science and machinery, and to disregard the jealousy of the<br>modem literary gent who hates science because science has stolen<br>literature's thunder. The earliest full-length attack on science and<br>machinery that I am acquainted with is in the third part of Gulliver's<br>Travels. But Swift's attack, though brilliant as a tour de force, is<br>irrelevant and even silly, because it is written from the standpoint--<br>perhaps this seems a queer thing to say of the author of Gulliver's Trawls<br>--of a man who lacked imagination. To Swift, science was merely a kind of<br>futile muckraking and the machines were non-sensical contraptions that<br>would never work. His standard was that of practical usefulness, and he<br>lacked the vision to see that an experiment which is not demonstrably<br>useful at the moment may yield results in the future. Elsewhere in the book<br>he names it as the best of all achievements 'to make two blades of grass<br>grow where one grew before'; not 'seeing, apparently, that this is just<br>what the machine can do. A little later the despised machines began<br>working, physical science increased its scope, and there came the<br>celebrated conflict between religion and science which agitated our<br>grandfathers. That conflict is over and both sides have retreated and<br>claimed a victory, but an anti-scientific bias still lingers in the minds<br>of most religious believers. All through the nineteenth century protesting<br>voices were raised against science and machinery (see Dickens's Hard Times,<br>for instance), but usually for the rather shallow reason that industrialism<br>in its first stages was cruel and ugly. Samuel Butler's attack on the<br>machine in the well-known chapter of Erewhon is a different matter. But<br>Butler himself lives in 'a less desperate age than our own, an age in which<br>it was still possible for a first-rate man to be a dilettante part of the<br>time, and therefore the whole thing appeared to him as a kind of<br>intellectual exercise. He saw clearly enough our abject dependence on the<br>machine, but instead of bothering to work out its consequences he preferred<br>to exaggerate it for the sake of what was not much more than a joke. It is<br>only in our own age, when mechanization has finally triumphed, that we can<br>actually feel the tendency of the machine to make a fully human life<br>impossible. There is probably no one capable of thinking and feeling who<br>has not occasionally looked at a gas-pipe chair and reflected that the<br>machine is the enemy of life. As a rule, however, this feeling is<br>instinctive rather than reasoned.<br><br>People know that in some way or another 'progress' is a swindle, but<br>they reach this conclusion by a kind of mental shorthand; my job here is to<br>supply the logical steps that are usually left out. But first one must ask,<br>what is the function of the machine? Obviously its primary function is to<br>save work, and the type of person to whom machine-civilization is entirely<br>acceptable seldom sees any reason for looking further. Here for instance is<br>a person who claims, or rather screams, that he is thoroughly at home in<br>the modem mechanized world. I am quoting from World Without Faith, by Mr<br>John Beevers. This is what he says:<br><br><br>It is plain lunacy to say that the average L2 10s. to L4 a week man<br>of today is a lower type than an eighteenth-century farm labourer. Or than<br>the labourer or peasant of any exclusively agricultural community now or in<br>the past. It just isn't true. It is so damn silly to cry out about the<br>civilizing effects of work in the fields and farmyards as against that done<br>in a big locomotive works or an automobile factory. Work is a nuisance. We<br>work because we have to and all work is done to provide us with leisure and<br>the means of spending that leisure as enjoyably as possible.<br><br><br>And again:<br><br><br>Man is going to have time enough and power enough to hunt for his<br>own heaven on earth without worrying about the super-natural one. The earth<br>will be so pleasant a place that the priest and the parson won't be left<br>with much of a tale to tell. Half the stuffing is knocked out of them by<br>one neat blow. Etc., etc., etc.<br><br><br>There is a whole chapter to this effect (Chapter 4 of Mr Beevers's<br>book), and it is of some interest as an exhibition of machine-worship in<br>its most completely vulgar, ignorant, and half-baked form. It is the<br>authentic voice of a large section of the modem world. Every aspirin-eater<br>in the outer suburbs would echo it fervently. Notice the shrill wail of<br>anger ('It just isn't troo-o-o!', etc.) with which Mr Beevers meets the<br>suggestion that his grandfather may have been a better man than himself;<br>and the still more horrible suggestion that if we returned to a simpler way<br>of life he might have to toughen his muscles with a job of work. Work, you<br>see, is done 'to provide us with leisure'. Leisure for what? Leisure to<br>become more like Mr Beevers, presumably. Though as a matter of fact, from<br>that line of talk about 'heaven on earth', you can make a fairly good guess<br>at what he would like civilization to be; a sort of Lyons Comer House<br>lasting in saecula saeculorum and getting bigger and noisier all the time.<br>And in any book by anyone who feels at home in the machine-world--in any<br>book by H. G. Wells, for instance--you will find passages of the same<br>kind. How often have we not heard it, that glutinously uplifting stuff<br>about 'the machines, our new race of slaves, which will set humanity free',<br>etc., etc., etc. To these people, apparently, the only danger of the<br>machine is its possible use for destructive purposes; as, for instance,<br>aero-planes are used in war. Barring wars and unforeseen disasters, the<br>future is envisaged as an ever more rapid march of mechanical progress;<br>machines to save work, machines to save thought, machines to save pain,<br>hygiene, efficiency, organization, more hygiene, more efficiency, more<br>organization, more machines--until finally you land up in the by now<br>familiar Wellsian Utopia, aptly caricatured by Huxley in Brave New World,<br>the paradise of little fat men. Of course in their day-dreams of the future<br>the little fat men are neither fat nor little; they are Men Like Gods. But<br>why should they be? All mechanical progress is towards greater and greater<br>efficiency; ultimately, therefore, towards a world in which nothing goes<br>wrong. But in a world in which nothing went wrong, many of the qualities<br>which Mr Wells regards as 'godlike' would be no more valuable than the<br>animal faculty of moving the ears. The beings in Men Like Gods and The<br>Dream are represented, for example, as brave, generous, and physically<br>strong. But in a world from which physical danger had been banished--and<br>obviously mechanical progress tends to eliminate danger--would physical<br>courage be likely to survive? Could it survive? And why should physical<br>strength survive in a world where there was never the need for physical<br>labour? As for such qualities as loyalty, generosity, etc., in a world<br>where nothing went wrong, they would be not only irrelevant but probably<br>unimaginable. The truth is that many of the qualities we admire in human<br>beings can only function in opposition to some kind of disaster, pain, or<br>difficulty; but the tendency of mechanical progress is to eliminate<br>disaster, pain, and difficulty. In books like The Dream and Men Like Gods<br>it is assumed that such qualities as strength, courage, generosity, etc.,<br>will be kept alive because they are comely qualities and necessary<br>attributes of a full human being. Presumably, for instance, the inhabitants<br>of Utopia would create artificial dangers in order to exercise their<br>courage, and do dumb-bell exercises to harden muscles which they would<br>never be obliged to use. And here you observe the huge contradiction which<br>is usually present in the idea of progress. The tendency of mechanical<br>progress is to make your environment safe and soft; and yet you are<br>striving to keep yourself brave and hard. You are at the same moment<br>furiously pressing forward and desperately holding back. It is as though a<br>London stockbroker should go to his office in a suit of chain mail and<br>insist on talking medieval Latin. So in the last analysis the champion of<br>progress is also the champion of anachronisms.<br><br>Meanwhile I am assuming that the tendency of mechanical progress is to<br>make life safe and soft. This may be disputed, because at any given moment<br>the effect of some recent mechanical invention may appear to be the<br>opposite. Take for instance the transition from horses to motor vehicles.<br>At a first glance one might say, considering the enormous toll of road<br>deaths, that the motor-car does not exactly tend to make life safer.<br>Moreover it probably needs as much toughness to be a first-rate dirt-track<br>rider as to be a broncho-buster or to ride in the Grand National.<br>Nevertheless the tendency of all machinery is to become safer and easier to<br>handle. The danger of accidents would disappear if we chose to tackle our<br>road-planning problem seriously, as we shall do sooner or later; and<br>meanwhile the motor-car has evolved to a point at which anyone who is not<br>blind or paralytic can drive it after a few lessons. Even now it needs far<br>less nerve and skill to drive a car ordinarily well than to ride a horse<br>ordinarily well; in twenty years' time it may need no nerve or skill at<br>all. Therefore, one must say that, taking society as a whole, the result of<br>the transition from horses to cars has been an increase in human softness.<br>Presently somebody comes along with another invention, the aeroplane for<br>instance, which does not at first sight appear to make life safer. The<br>first men who went up in aeroplanes were superlatively brave, and even<br>today it must need an exceptionally good nerve to be a pilot. But the same<br>tendency as before is at work. The aeroplane, like the motor-car, will be<br>made foolproof; a million engineers are working, almost unconsciously, in<br>that direction. Finally--this is the objective, though it may never quite<br>be reached--you will get an aeroplane whose pilot needs no more skill or<br>courage than a baby needs in its perambulator. And all mechanical progress<br>is and must be in this direction. A machine evolves by becoming more<br>efficient, that is, more foolproof; hence the objective of mechanical<br>progress is a foolproof world--which may or may not mean a world<br>inhabited by fools. Mr Wells would probably retort that the world can never<br>become fool-proof, because, however high a standard of efficiency you have<br>reached, there is always some greater difficulty ahead. For example (this<br>is Mr Wells's favourite idea--he has used it in goodness knows how many<br>perorations), when you have got this planet of ours perfectly into trim,<br>you start upon the enormous task of reaching and colonizing another. But<br>this is merely to push the objective further into the future; the objective<br>itself remains the same. Colonize another planet, and the game of<br>mechanical progress begins anew; for the foolproof world you have<br>substituted the foolproof solar system--the foolproof universe. In tying<br>yourself to the ideal of mechanical efficiency, you tie yourself to the<br>ideal of softness. But softness is repulsive; and thus all progress is seen<br>to be a frantic struggle towards an objective which you hope and pray will<br>never be reached. Now and again, but not often, you meet somebody who<br>grasps that what is usually called progress also entails what is usually<br>called degeneracy, and who is nevertheless in favour of progress. Hence the<br>fact that in Mr Shaw's Utopia a statue was erected to Falstaff, as the<br>first man who ever made a speech in favour of cowardice.<br><br>But the trouble goes immensely deeper than this. Hitherto I have only<br>pointed out the absurdity of aiming at mechanical progress and also at the<br>preservation of qualities which mechanical progress makes unnecessary. The<br>question one has got to consider is whether there is any human activity<br>which would not be maimed by the dominance of the machine.<br><br>The function of the machine is to save work. In a fully mechanized<br>world all the dull drudgery will be done by machinery, leaving us free for<br>more interesting pursuits. So expressed, this sounds splendid. It makes one<br>sick to see half a dozen men sweating their guts out to dig a trench for a<br>water-pipe, when some easily devised machine would scoop the earth out in a<br>couple of minutes. Why not let the machine do the work and the men go and<br>do something else. But presently the question arises, what else are they to<br>do? Supposedly they are set free from 'work' in order that they may do<br>something which is not 'work'. But what is work and what is not work? Is it<br>work to dig, to carpenter, to plant trees, to fell trees, to ride, to fish,<br>to hunt, to feed chickens, to play the piano, to take photographs, to build<br>a house, to cook, to sew, to trim hats, to mend motor bicycles? All of<br>these things are work to somebody, and all of them are play to somebody.<br>There are in fact very few activities which cannot be classed either as<br>work or play according as you choose to regard them. The labourer set free<br>from digging may want to spend his leisure, or part of it, in playing the<br>piano, while the professional pianist may be only too glad to get out and<br>dig at the potato patch. Hence the antithesis between work, as something<br>intolerably tedious, and not-work, as something desirable, is false. The<br>truth is that when a human being is riot eating, drinking, sleeping, making<br>love, talking, playing games, or merely lounging about--and these things<br>will not fill up a lifetime--he needs work and usually looks for it,<br>though he may not call it work. Above the level of a third- or fourth-grade<br>moron, life has got to be lived largely in terms of effort. For man is not,<br>as the vulgarer hedonists seem to suppose, a kind of walking stomach; he<br>has also got a hand, an eye, and a brain. Cease to use your hands, and you<br>have lopped off a huge chunk of your conscious-ness. And now consider again<br>those half-dozen men who were digging the trench for the water-pipe. A<br>machine has set them free from digging, and they are going to amuse<br>themselves with something else--carpentering, for instance. But whatever<br>they want to do, they will find that another machine has set them free from<br>that. For in a fully mechanized world there would be no more need to<br>carpenter, to cook, to mend motor bicycles, etc., than there would be to<br>dig. There is scarcely anything, from catching a whale to carving a cherry<br>stone, that could not conceivably be done by machinery. The machine would<br>even encroach upon the activities we now class as 'art'; it is doing so<br>already, via the camera and the radio. Mechanize the world as fully as it<br>might be mechanized, and whichever way you turn there will be some machine<br>cutting you off from the chance of working--that is, of living.<br><br>At a first glance this might not seem to matter. Why should you not<br>get on with your 'creative work' and disregard the machines that would do<br>it for you? But it is not so simple as it sounds. Here am I, working eight<br>hours a day in an insurance office; in my spare time I want to do something<br>'creative', so I choose to do a bit of carpentering--to make myself a<br>table, for instance. Notice that from the very start there is a touch of<br>artificiality about the whole business, for the factories can turn me out a<br>far better table than I can make for myself. But even when I get to work on<br>my table, it is not possible for me to feel towards it as the cabinet-maker<br>of a hundred years ago felt towards his table, still less as Robinson<br>Crusoe felt towards his. For before I start, most of the work has already<br>been done for me by machinery. The tools I use demand the minimum of skill.<br>I can get, for instance, planes which will cut out any moulding; the<br>cabinet-maker of a hundred years ago would have had to do the work with<br>chisel and gouge, which demanded real skill of eye and hand. The boards I<br>buy are ready planed and the legs are ready turned by the lathe. I can even<br>go to the wood-shop and buy all the parts of the table ready-made and only<br>needing to be fitted together; my work being reduced to driving in a few<br>pegs and using a piece of sandpaper. And if this is so at present, in the<br>mechanized future it will be enormously more so. With the tools and<br>materials available then, there will be no possibility of mistake, hence no<br>room for skill. Making a table will be easier and duller than peeling a<br>potato. In such circumstances it is nonsense to talk of 'creative work'. In<br>any case the arts of the hand (which have got to be transmitted by<br>apprenticeship) would long since have disappeared. Some of them have<br>disappeared already, under the competition of the machine. Look round any<br>country churchyard and see whether you can find a decently-cut tombstone<br>later than 1820. The art, or rather the craft, of stonework has died out so<br>completely that it would take centuries to revive it.<br><br>But it may be said, why not retain the machine and retain 'creative<br>work'? Why not cultivate anachronisms as a spare-time hobby? Many people<br>have played with this idea; it seems to solve with such beautiful ease the<br>problems set by the machine. The citizen of Utopia, we are told, coming<br>home from his daily two hours of turning a handle in the tomato-canning<br>factory, will deliberately revert to a more primitive way of life and<br>solace his creative instincts with a bit of fretwork, pottery-glazing, or<br>handloom-weaving. And why is this picture an absurdity--as it is, of<br>course? Because of a principle that is not always recognized, though always<br>acted upon: that so long as the machine is there, one is under an<br>obligation to use it. No one draws water from the well when he can turn on<br>the tap. One sees a good illustration of this in the matter of travel.<br>Everyone who has travelled by primitive methods in an undeveloped country<br>knows that the difference between that kind of travel and modern travel in<br>trains, cars, etc., is the difference between life and death. The nomad who<br>walks or rides, with his baggage stowed on a camel or an ox-cart, may<br>suffer every kind of discomfort, but at least he is living while he is<br>travelling; whereas for the passenger in an express train or a luxury liner<br>his journey is an interregnum, a kind of temporary death. And yet so long<br>as the railways exist, one has got to travel by train--or by car or<br>aeroplane. Here am I, forty miles from London. When I want to go up to<br>London why do I not pack my luggage on to a mule and set out on foot,<br>making a two days of it? Because, with the Green Line buses whizzing past<br>me every ten minutes, such a journey would be intolerably irksome. In order<br>that one may enjoy primitive methods of travel, it is necessary that no<br>other method should be available. No human being ever wants to do anything<br>in a more cumbrous way than is necessary. Hence the absurdity of that<br>picture of Utopians saving their souls with fretwork. In a world where<br>every-thing could be done by machinery, everything would be done by<br>machinery. Deliberately to revert to primitive methods to use archaic took,<br>to put silly little difficulties in your own way, would be a piece of<br>dilettantism, of pretty-pretty arty and craftiness. It would be like<br>solemnly sitting down to eat your dinner with stone implements. Revert to<br>handwork in a machine age, and you are back in Ye Olde Tea Shoppe or the<br>Tudor villa with the sham beams tacked to the wall.<br><br>The tendency of mechanical progress, then, is to frustrate the human<br>need for effort and creation. It makes unnecessary and even impossible the<br>activities of the eye and the hand. The apostle of 'progress' will<br>sometimes declare that this does not matter, but you can usually drive him<br>into a comer by pointing out the horrible lengths to which the process can<br>be carried. Why, for instance, use your hands at all--why use them even<br>for blowing your nose or sharpening a pencil? Surely you could fix some<br>kind of steel and rubber contraption to your shoulders and let your arms<br>wither into stumps of skin and bone? And so with every organ and every<br>faculty. There is really no reason why a human being should do more than<br>eat, drink, sleep, breathe, and procreate; everything else could be done<br>for him by machinery. Therefore the logical end of mechanical progress is<br>to reduce the human being to something resembling a brain in a bottle. That<br>is the goal towards which we are already moving, though, of course, we have<br>no intention of getting there; just as a man who drinks a bottle of whisky<br>a day does not actually intend to get cirrhosis of the liver. The implied<br>objective of 'progress' is--not exactly, perhaps, the brain in the<br>bottle, but at any rate some frightful subhuman depth of softness and<br>helplessness. And the unfortunate thing is that at present the word<br>'progress' and the word 'Socialism' are linked in-separably in almost<br>everyone's mind. The kind of person who hates machinery also takes it for<br>granted to hate Socialism; the Socialist is always in favour of<br>mechanization, rationalization, modernization--or at least thinks that he<br>ought to be in favour of them. Quite recently, for instance, a prominent<br>I.L.P.'er confessed to me with a sort of wistful shame--as though it were<br>something faintly improper--that he was 'fond of horses'. Horses, you<br>see, belong to the vanished agricultural past, and all sentiment for the<br>past carries with it a vague smell of heresy. I do not believe that this<br>need necessarily be so, but undoubtedly it is so. And in itself it is quite<br>enough to explain the alienation of decent minds from Socialism.<br><br>A generation ago every intelligent person was in some sense a<br>revolutionary; nowadays it would be nearer the mark to say that every<br>intelligent person is a reactionary. In this connexion it is worth<br>comparing H. G. Wells's The Sleeper Awakes with Aldous Huxley's Brave New<br>World, written thirty years later. Each is a pessimistic Utopia, a vision<br>of a sort of prig's paradise in which all the dreams of the 'progressive'<br>person come true. Considered merely as a piece of imaginative construction<br>The Sleeper Awakes is, I think, much superior, but it suffers from vast<br>contradictions because of the fact that Wells, as the arch-priest of<br>'progress', cannot write with any conviction against 'progress'. He draws a<br>picture of a glittering, strangely sinister world in which the privileged<br>classes live a life of shallow gutless hedonism, and the workers, reduced<br>to a state of utter slavery and sub-human ignorance, toil like troglodytes<br>in caverns underground. As soon as one examines this idea--it is further<br>developed in a splendid short story in Stories of Space and Time--one<br>sees its inconsistency. For in the immensely mechanized world that Wells is<br>imagining, why should the workers have to work harder than at present?<br>Obviously the tendency of the machine is to eliminate work, not to increase<br>it. In the machine-world the workers might be enslaved, ill-treated, and<br>even under-fed, but they certainly would not be condemned to ceaseless<br>manual toil; because in that case what would be the function of the<br>machine? You can have machines doing all the work or human beings doing all<br>the work, but you can't have both. Those armies of underground workers,<br>with their blue uniforms and their debased, half-human language, are only<br>put in 'to make your flesh creep'. Wells wants to suggest that 'progress'<br>might take a wrong turning; but the only evil he cares to imagine is<br>inequality--one class grabbing all the wealth and power and oppressing<br>the others, apparently out of pure spite. Give it quite a small twist, he<br>seems to suggest, overthrow the privileged class--change over from world-<br>capitalism to Socialism, in fact--and all will be well. The machine-<br>civilization is to continue, but its products are to be shared out equally.<br>The thought he dare not face is that the machine itself may be the enemy.<br>So in his more characteristic Utopias (The Dream, Men Like Gods, etc.), he<br>returns to optimism and to a vision of humanity, 'liberated' by the<br>machine, as a race of enlightened sunbathers whose sole topic of<br>conversation is their own superiority to their ancestors. Brave New World<br>belongs to a later time and to a generation which has seen through the<br>swindle of 'progress'. It contains its own contradictions (the most<br>important of them is pointed out in Mr John Strachey's The Coming Struggle<br>for Power), but it is at least a memorable assault on the more fat-bellied<br>type of perfectionism. Allowing for the exaggerations of caricature, it<br>probably expresses what a majority of thinking people feel about machine-<br>civilization.<br><br>The sensitive person's hostility to the machine is in one sense<br>unrealistic, because of the obvious fact that the machine has come to stay.<br>But as an attitude of mind there is a great deal to be said for it. The<br>machine has got to be accepted, but it is probably better to accept it<br>rather as one accepts a drug--that is, grudgingly and suspiciously. Like<br>a drug, the machine is useful, dangerous, and habit-forming. The oftener<br>one surrenders to it the tighter its grip becomes. You have only to look<br>about you at this moment to realize with what sinister speed the machine is<br>getting us into its power. To begin with, there is the frightful debauchery<br>of taste that has already been effected by a century of mechanization. This<br>is almost too obvious and too generally admitted to need pointing out. But<br>as a single instance, take taste in its narrowest sense--the taste for<br>decent food. In the highly mechanized countries, thanks to tinned food,<br>cold storage, synthetic flavouring matters, etc., the palate is almost a<br>dead organ. As you can see by looking at any greengrocer's shop, what the<br>majority of English people mean by an apple is a lump of highly-coloured<br>cotton wool from America or Australia; they will devour these things,<br>apparently with pleasure, and let the English apples rot under the trees.<br>It is the shiny, standardized, machine-made look of the American apple that<br>appeals to them; the superior taste of the English apple is something they<br>simply do not notice. Or look at the factory-made, foil-wrapped cheese and<br>'blended' butter in any grocer's; look at the hideous rows of tins which<br>usurp more and more of the space in any food-shop, even a dairy; look at a<br>sixpenny Swiss roll or a twopenny ice-cream; look at the filthy chemical<br>by-product that people will pour down their throats under the name of beer.<br>Wherever you look you will see some slick machine-made article triumphing<br>over the old-fashioned article that still tastes of something other than<br>sawdust. And what applies to food applies also to furniture, houses,<br>clothes, books, amusements, and everything else that makes up our<br>environment. There are now millions of people, and they are increasing<br>every year, to whom the blaring of a radio is not only a more accept-able<br>but a more normal background to their thoughts than the lowing of cattle or<br>the song of birds. The mechanization of the world could never proceed very<br>far while taste, even the taste-buds of the tongue, remained uncorrupted,<br>be-cause in that case most of the products of the machine would be simply<br>unwanted. In a healthy world there would be no demand for tinned foods,<br>aspirins, gramophones, gaspipe chairs, machine guns, daily newspapers,<br>telephones, motor-cars, etc., etc.; and on the other hand there would be a<br>constant demand for the things the machine cannot produce. But meanwhile<br>the machine is here, and its corrupting effects are almost irresistible.<br>One inveighs against it, but one goes on using it. Even a bare-arse savage,<br>given the chance, will learn the vices of civilization within a few months.<br>Mechanization leads to the decay of taste, the decay of taste leads to the<br>demand for machine-made articles and hence to more mechanization, and so a<br>vicious circle is established.<br><br>But in addition to this there is a tendency for the mechanization of<br>the world to proceed as it were automatically, whether we want it or not.<br>This is due to the fact that in modem Western man the faculty of mechanical<br>invention has been fed and stimulated till it has reached almost the status<br>of an instinct. People invent new machines and improve existing ones almost<br>unconsciously, rather as a somnambulist will go on working in his sleep. In<br>the past, when it was taken for granted that life on this planet is harsh<br>or at any rate laborious, it Seemed the natural fate to go on using the<br>clumsy implements of your forefathers, and only a few eccentric persons,<br>centuries apart, proposed innovations; hence throughout enormous ages such<br>things as the ox-cart, the plough, the sickle, etc., remained radically<br>unchanged. It is on record that screws have been in use since remote<br>antiquity and yet that it was not till the middle of the nineteenth century<br>that anyone thought of making screws with points on them, for several<br>thousand years they remained flat-ended and holes had to be drilled for<br>them before they could be inserted. In our own epoch such a thing would be<br>unthinkable. For almost every modem Western man has his inventive faculty<br>to some extent developed; the Western man invents machines as naturally as<br>the Polynesian islander swims. Give a Western man a job of work and he<br>immediately begins devising a machine that would do it for him; give him a<br>machine and he thinks of ways of improving it. I understand this tendency<br>well enough, for in an ineffectual sort of way I have that type of mind<br>myself. I have not either the patience or the mechanical skill to devise<br>any machine that would work, but I am perpetually seeing, as it were, the<br>ghosts of possible machines that might save me the trouble of using my<br>brain or muscles. A person with a more definite mechanical turn would<br>probably construct some of them and put them into operation. But under our<br>present economic system, whether he constructed them--or rather, whether<br>anyone else had the benefit of them--would depend upon whether they were<br>commercially valuable. The Socialists are right, therefore, when they claim<br>that the rate of mechanical progress will be much more rapid once Socialism<br>is established. Given a mechanical civilization the process of invention<br>and improvement will always continue, but the tendency of capitalism is to<br>slow it down, because under capitalism any invention which does not promise<br>fairly immediate profits is neglected; some, indeed, which threaten to<br>reduce profits are suppressed almost as ruthlessly as the flexible glass<br>mentioned by Petronius.[For example: Some years ago someone invented a<br>gramophone needle that would last for decades. One of the big gramophone<br>companies bought up the patent rights, and that was the last that was ever<br>beard of it.] Establish Socialism--remove the profit principle--and the<br>inventor will have a free hand. The mechanization of the world, already<br>rapid enough, would be or at any rate could be enormously accelerated.<br><br>And this prospect is a slightly sinister one, because it is obvious<br>even now that the process of mechanization is out of control. It is<br>happening merely because humanity has got the habit. A chemist perfects a<br>new method of synthesizing rubber, or a mechanic devises a new pattern of<br>gudgeon-pin. Why? Not for any clearly understood purpose, but simply from<br>the impulse to invent and improve, which has now become instinctive. Put a<br>pacifist to work in a bomb-factory and in two months he will be devising a<br>new type of bomb. Hence the appearance of such diabolical things as poison<br>gases, which are not expected even by their inventors to be beneficial to<br>humanity. Our attitude towards such things as poison gases ought to be the<br>attitude of the king of Brobdingnag towards gunpowder; but because we live<br>in a mechanical and scientific age we are infected with the notion that,<br>whatever else happens, 'progress' must continue and knowledge must never be<br>suppressed. Verbally, no doubt, we would agree that machinery is made for<br>man and not man for machinery; in practice any attempt to check the<br>development of the machine appears to us an attack on knowledge and<br>therefore a kind of blasphemy. And even if the whole of humanity suddenly<br>revolted against the machine and decided to escape to a simpler way of<br>life, the escape would still be immensely difficult. It would not do, as in<br>Butler's Erewhon, to smash every machine invented after a certain date; we<br>should also have to smash the habit of mind that would, almost<br>involuntarily, devise fresh machines as soon as the old ones were smashed.<br>And in all of us there is at least a tinge of that habit of mind. In every<br>country in the world the large army of scientists and technicians, with the<br>rest of us panting at their heels, are marching along the road of<br>'progress' with the blind persistence of a column of ants. Comparatively<br>few people want it to happen, plenty of people actively want it not to<br>happen, and yet it is happening. The process of mechanization has itself<br>become a machine, a huge glittering vehicle whirling us we are not certain<br>where, but probably towards the padded Wells-world and the brain in the<br>bottle.<br><br>This, then, is the case against the machine. Whether it is a sound or<br>unsound case hardly matters. The point is that these or very Similar<br>arguments would be echoed by every person who is hostile to<br>machine-civilization. And unfortunately, because of that nexus of thought,<br>'Socialism-progress-machinery-Russia-tractor-hygiene-machinery-progress',<br>which exists in almost everyone's mind, it is usually the same person who<br>is hostile to Socialism. The kind of person who hates central heating and<br>gaspipe chairs is also the kind of person who, when you mention Socialism,<br>murmurs something about' beehive state' and moves away with a pained<br>expression. So far as my observation goes, very few Socialists grasp why<br>this is so, or even that it is so. Get the more vocal type of Socialist<br>into a comer, repeat to him the substance of what I have said in this<br>chapter, and see what kind of answer you get. As a matter of fact you will<br>get several answers; I am so familiar with them that I know them almost by<br>heart.<br><br>In the first place he will tell you that it is impossible to 'go back'<br>(or to 'put back the hand of progress'--as though the hand of progress<br>hadn't been pretty violently put back several times in human history!), and<br>will then accuse you of being a medievalist and begin to descant upon the<br>horrors of the Middle Ages, leprosy, the Inquisition, etc. As a matter of<br>fact, most attacks upon the Middle Ages and the past generally by<br>apologists of modernity are beside the point, because their essential trick<br>is to project a modern man, with his squeamishness and his high standards<br>of comfort, into an age when such things were unheard of. But notice that<br>in any case this is not an answer. For a dislike of the mechanized future<br>does not imply the smallest reverence for any period of the past. D. H.<br>Lawrence, wiser than the medievalist, chose to idealize the Etruscans about<br>whom we know conveniently little. But there is no need to idealize even the<br>Etruscans or the Pelasgians, or the Aztecs, or the Sumerians, or any other<br>vanished and romantic people. When one pictures a desirable civilization,<br>one pictures it merely as an objective; there is no need to pretend that it<br>has ever existed in space and time. Press this point home, explain that you<br>wish to aim at making life simpler and harder instead of softer and more<br>complex, and the Socialist will usually assume that you want to revert to a<br>'state of nature'--meaning some stinking palaeolithic cave: as though<br>there were nothing between a flint scraper and the steel mills of<br>Sheffield, or between a skin coracle and the Queen Mary.<br><br>Finally, however, you will get an answer which is rather more to the<br>point and which runs roughly as follows: 'Yes, what you are saying is all<br>very well in its way. No doubt it would be very noble to harden ourselves<br>and do without aspirins and central heating and so forth. But the point is,<br>you see, that nobody seriously wants it. It would mean going back to an<br>agricultural way of life, which means beastly hard work and isn't at all<br>the same thing as playing at gardening. I don't want hard work, you don't<br>want hard work--nobody wants it who knows what it means. You only talk as<br>you do because you've never done a day's work in your life,' etc., etc.<br><br>Now this in a sense is true. It amounts to saying, 'We're soft--for<br>God's sake let's stay soft!' which at least is realistic. As I have pointed<br>out already, the machine has got us in its grip and to escape will be<br>immensely difficult. Nevertheless this answer is really an evasion, because<br>it fails to make dear what we mean when we say that we 'want' this or that.<br>I am a degenerate modem semi-intellectual who would die if I did not get my<br>early morning cup of tea and my New Statesman every Friday. Clearly I do<br>not, in a sense, 'want' to return to a simpler, harder, probably<br>agricultural way of life. In the same sense I don't 'want' to cut down my<br>drinking, to pay my debts, to take enough exercise, to be faithful to my<br>wife, etc., etc. But in another and more permanent sense I do want these<br>things, and perhaps in the same sense I want a civilization in which<br>'progress' is not definable as making the world safe for little fat men.<br>These that I have outlined are practically the only arguments that I have<br>been able to get from Socialists--thinking, book-trained Socialists--<br>when I have tried to explain to them just how they are driving away<br>possible adherents. Of course there is also the old argument that Socialism<br>is going to arrive anyway, whether people like it or not, because of that<br>trouble-saving thing, 'historic necessity'. But 'historic necessity', or<br>rather the belief in it, has failed to survive Hitler.<br><br>Meanwhile the thinking person, by intellect usually left-wing but by<br>temperament often right-wing, hovers at the gate of the Socialist fold. He<br>is no doubt aware that he ought to be a Socialist. But he observes first<br>the dullness of individual Socialists, then the apparent flabbiness of<br>Socialist ideals, and veers away. Till quite recently it was natural to<br>veer towards indinerentism. Ten years ago, even five years ago, the typical<br>literary gent wrote books on baroque architecture and had a soul above<br>politics. But that attitude is becoming difficult and even unfashionable.<br>The times are growing harsher, the issues are clearer, the belief that<br>nothing, will ever change (i.e. that your dividends will always be safe) is<br>less prevalent. The fence on which the literary gent sits, once as<br>comfortable as the plush cushion of a cathedral stall, is now pinching his<br>bottom intolerably; more and more he shows a disposition to drop off on one<br>side or the other. It is interesting to notice how many of our leading<br>writers, who a dozen years ago were art for art's saking for all they were<br>worth and would have considered it too vulgar for words even to vote at a<br>general election, are now taking a definite political standpoint; while<br>most of the younger writers, at least those of them who are not mere<br>footlers, have been 'political' from the start. I believe that when the<br>pinch comes there is a terrible danger that the main movement of the<br>intelligentsia will be towards Fascism. Just how soon the pinch will come<br>it is difficult to say; it depends, probably, upon events in Europe; but it<br>may be that within two years or even a year we shall have reached the<br>decisive moment. That will also be the moment when every person with any<br>brains or any decency will know in his bones that he ought to be on the<br>Socialist side. But he will not necessarily come there of his own accord;<br>there are too many ancient prejudices standing in the way. He will have to<br>be persuaded, and by methods that imply an understanding of his viewpoint.<br>Socialists cannot afford to waste any more time in preaching to the<br>converted. Their job now is to make Socialists as rapidly as possible;<br>instead of which, all too often, they are making Fascists.<br><br>When I speak of Fascism in England, I am not necessarily thinking of<br>Mosley and his pimpled followers. English Fascism, when it arrives, is<br>likely to be of a sedate and subtle kind (presumably, at any rate at first,<br>it won't be called Fascism), and it is doubtful whether a Gilbert and<br>Sullivan heavy dragoon of Mosley's stamp would ever be much more than a<br>joke to the majority of English people; though even Mosley will bear<br>watching, for experience shows (vide the careers of Hitler, Napoleon III)<br>that to a political climber it is sometimes an advantage not to be taken<br>too seriously at the beginning of his career. But what I am thinking of at<br>this moment is the Fascist attitude of mind, which beyond any doubt is<br>gaining ground among people who ought to know better. Fascism as it appears<br>in the intellectual is a sort of mirror-image--not actually of Socialism<br>but of a plausible travesty of Socialism. It boils down to a determination<br>to do the opposite of whatever the mythical Socialist does. If you present<br>Socialism in a bad and misleading light--if you let people imagine that<br>it does not mean much more than pouring European civilization down the sink<br>at the command of Marxist prigs--you risk driving the intellectual into<br>Fascism. You frighten him into a sort of angry defensive attitude in which<br>he simply refuses to listen to the Socialist case. Some such attitude is<br>already quite clearly discernible in writers like Pound, Wyndham Lewis, Roy<br>Gampbell, etc., in most of the Roman Catholic writers and many of the<br>Douglas Credit group, in certain popular novelists, and even, if one looks<br>below the surface, in so-superior conservative highbrows like Eliot and his<br>countless followers. If you want some unmistakable illustrations of the<br>growth of Fascist feeling in England, have a look at some of the<br>innumerable letters that were written to the Press during the Abyssinian<br>war, approving the Italian action, and also the howl of glee that went up<br>from. both Catholic and Anglican pulpits (see the Daily Mail of 17 August<br>1936) over the Fascist rising in Spain.<br><br>In order to combat Fascism it is necessary to understand it, which<br>involves admitting that it contains some good as well as much evil. In<br>practice, of course, it is merely an infamous tyranny, and its methods of<br>attaining and holding power are such that even its most ardent apologists<br>prefer to talk about something else. But the underlying feeling of Fascism,<br>the feeling that first draws people into the Fascist camp, may be less<br>contemptible. It is not always, as the Saturday Review would lead one to<br>suppose, a squealing terror of the Bolshevik bogey-man. Everyone who has<br>given the movement so much as a glance knows that the rank-and-file Fascist<br>is often quite a well-meaning person--quite genuinely anxious, for<br>instance, to better the lot of the unemployed. But more important than this<br>is the fact that Fascism draws its strength from the good as well as the<br>bad varieties of conservatism. To anyone with a feeling for tradition and<br>for discipline it comes with its appeal ready-made. Probably it is very<br>easy, when you have had a bellyful of the more tactless kind of Socialist<br>propaganda, to see Fascism as the last line defence of all that is good in<br>European civilization. Even the Fascist bully at his symbolic worst, with<br>rubber truncheon in one hand and castor oil bottle in the other, does not<br>necessarily feel himself a bully; more probably he feels like Roland in the<br>pass at Roncevaux, defending Christendom against the barbarian. We have got<br>to admit that if Fascism is everywhere advancing, this is largely the fault<br>of Socialists themselves. Partly it is due to the mistaken Communist tactic<br>of sabotaging democracy, i.e. sawing off the branch you are sitting on; but<br>still more to the fact that Socialists have, so to speak, presented their<br>case wrong side foremost. They have never made it sufficiently clear that<br>the essential aims of Socialism are justice and liberty. With their eyes<br>glued to economic facts, they have proceeded on the assumption that man has<br>no soul, and explicitly or implicitly they have set up the goal of a<br>materialistic Utopia. As a result Fascism has been able to play upon every<br>instinct that revolts against hedonism and a cheap conception of<br>'progress'. It has been able to pose as the upholder of the European<br>tradition, and to appeal to Christian belief, to patriotism, and to the<br>military virtues. It is far worse than useless to write Fascism off as<br>'mass sadism', or some easy phrase of that kind. If you pretend that it is<br>merely an aberration which will presently pass off of its own accord, you<br>are dreaming a dream from which you will awake when somebody coshes you<br>with a rubber truncheon. The only possible course is to examine the Fascist<br>case, grasp that there is something to be said for it, and then make it<br>clear to the world that whatever good Fascism contains is also implicit in<br>Socialism.<br><br>At present the situation is desperate. Even if nothing worse befalls<br>us, there are the conditions which I described in the earlier part of this<br>book and which are not going to improve under our present economic system.<br>Still more urgent is the danger of Fascist domination in Europe. And unless<br>Socialist doctrine, in an effective form, can be diffused widely and very<br>quickly, there is no certainty that Fascism will ever be overthrown. For<br>Socialism is the only real enemy that Fascism has to face. The capitalist-<br>imperialist governments, even though they themselves are about to be<br>plundered, will not fight with any conviction against Fascism as such. Our<br>rulers, those of them who understand the issue, would probably prefer to<br>hand over every square inch of the British Empire to Italy, Germany, and<br>Japan than to see Socialism triumphant. It was easy to laugh at Fascism<br>when we imagined that it was based on hysterical nationalism, because it<br>seemed obvious that the Fascist states, each regarding itself as the chosen<br>people and patriotic contra mundum, would clash with one another. But<br>nothing of the kind is happening. Fascism is now an international movement,<br>which means not only that the Fascist nations can combine for purposes of<br>loot, but that they are groping, perhaps only half consciously as yet,<br>towards a world-system. For the vision of the totalitarian state there is<br>being substituted the vision of the totalitarian world. As I pointed out<br>earlier, the advance of machine-technique must lead ultimately to some form<br>of collectivism, but that form need not necessarily be equalitarian; that<br>is, it need not be Socialism. Pace the economists, it is quite easy to<br>imagine a world-society, economically collectivist--that is, with the<br>profit principle eliminated--but with all political, military, and<br>educational power in the hands of a small caste of rulers and their bravos.<br>That or something like it is the objective of Fascism. And that, of course,<br>is the slave-state, or rather the slave-world; it would probably be a<br>stable form of society, and the chances are, considering the enormous<br>wealth of the world if scientifically exploited, that the slaves would be<br>well-fed and contented. It is usual to speak of the Fascist objective as<br>the 'beehive state', which does a grave injustice to bees. A world of<br>rabbits ruled by stoats would be nearer the mark. It is against this<br>beastly possibility that we have got to combine.<br><br>The only thing for which we can combine is the underlying ideal of<br>Socialism; justice and liberty. But it is hardly strong enough to call this<br>ideal 'underlying'. It is almost completely forgotten. It has been buried<br>beneath layer after layer of doctrinaire priggishness, party squabbles, and<br>half-baked 'progressivism' until it is like a diamond hidden under a<br>mountain of dung. The job of the Socialist is to get it out again. Justice<br>and liberty! Those are the words that have got to ring like a bugle across<br>the world. For a long time past, certainly for the last ten years, the<br>devil has had all the best tunes. We have reached a stage when the very<br>word 'Socialism' calls up, on the one hand, a picture of aeroplanes,<br>tractors, and huge glittering factories of glass and concrete; on the<br>other, a picture of vegetarians with wilting beards, of Bolshevik<br>commissars (half gangster, half gramophone), of earnest ladies in sandals,<br>shock-headed Marxists chewing polysyllables, escaped Quakers, birth-control<br>fanatics, and Labour Party backstairs-crawlers. Socialism, at least in this<br>island, does not smell any longer of revolution and the overthrow of<br>tyrants; it smells of crankishness, machine-worship, and the stupid cult of<br>Russia. Unless you can remove that smell, and very rapidly, Fascism may<br>win. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/10.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/12.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
