<h2>Chapter 13</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">And finally, is there anything one can do about it?<br><br>In the first part of this book I illustrated, by a few brief<br>sidelights, the kind of mess we are in; in this second part I have been<br>trying to explain why, in my opinion, so many normal decent people are<br>repelled by the only remedy, namely by Socialism. Obviously the most urgent<br>need of the next few years is to capture those normal decent ones before<br>Fascism plays its trump card. I do not want to raise here the question of<br>parties and political expedients. More important than any party label<br>(though doubtless the mere menace of Fascism will presently bring some kind<br>of Popular Front into existence) is the diffusion of Socialist doctrine in<br>an effective form. People have got to be made ready to act as Socialists.<br>There are, I believe, countless people who, without being aware of it, are<br>in sympathy with the essential aims of Socialism, and who could be won over<br>almost with-out a struggle if only one could find the word that would move<br>them. Everyone who knows the meaning of poverty, everyone who has a genuine<br>hatred of tyranny and war, is on the Socialist side, potentially. My job<br>here, therefore, is to suggest--necessarily in very general terms--how<br>a reconciliation might be effected between Socialism and its more<br>intelligent enemies.<br><br>First, as to the enemies themselves--I mean all those people who<br>grasp that capitalism is evil but who are conscious of a sort of queasy,<br>shuddering sensation when Socialism is mentioned. As I have pointed out,<br>this is traceable to two main causes. One is the personal inferiority of<br>many individual Socialists; the other is the fact that Socialism is too<br>often coupled with a fat-bellied, godless conception of 'progress' which<br>revolts anyone with a feeling for tradition or the rudiments of an<br>aesthetic sense. Let me take the second point first.<br><br>The distaste for 'progress' and machine-civilization which is so<br>common among sensitive people is only defensible as an attitude of mind. It<br>is not valid as a reason for rejecting Socialism, because it presupposes an<br>alternative which does not exist. When you say, 'I object to mechanization<br>and standardization--therefore I object to Socialism', you are saying in<br>effect, 'I am free to do without the machine if I choose', which is<br>nonsense. We are all dependent upon the machine, and if the machines<br>stopped working most of us would die. You may hate the machine-<br>civilization, probably you are right to hate it, but for the present there<br>can be no question of accepting or rejecting it. The machine-civilization<br>is here, and it can only be criticized from the inside, because all of us<br>are inside it. It is only romantic fools who natter themselves that they<br>have escaped, like the literary gent in his Tudor cottage with bathroom h.<br>and c., and the he-man who goes off to live a 'primitive' life in the<br>jungle with a Mannlicher rifle and four wagon-loads of tinned food. And<br>almost certainly the machine-civilization will continue to triumph. There<br>is no reason to think that it will destroy itself or stop functioning of<br>its own accord. For some time past it has been fashionable to say that war<br>is presently going to 'wreck civilization' altogether; but, though the next<br>full-sized war will certainly be horrible enough to make all previous ones<br>seem a joke, it is immensely unlikely that it will put a stop to mechanical<br>progress. It is true that a very vulnerable country like England, and<br>perhaps the whole of western Europe, could be reduced to chaos by a few<br>thousand well-placed bombs, but no war is at present thinkable which could<br>wipe out industrialization in all countries simultaneously. We may take it<br>that the return to a simpler, free, less mechanized way of life, however<br>desirable it may be, is not going to happen. This is not fatalism, it is<br>merely acceptance of facts. It is meaningless to oppose Socialism on the<br>ground that you object to the beehive State, for the beehive State is here.<br>The choice is not, as yet, between a human and an inhuman world. It is<br>simply between Socialism and Fascism, which at its very best is Socialism<br>with the virtues left out.<br><br>The job of the thinking person, therefore, is not to reject Socialism<br>but to make up his mind to humanize it. Once Socialism is in a way to being<br>established, those who can see through the swindle of 'progress' will<br>probably find themselves resisting. In fact, it is their special function<br>to do so. In the machine-world they have got to be a sort of permanent<br>opposition, which is not the same thing as being an obstructionist or a<br>traitor. But in this I am speaking of the future. For the moment the only<br>possible course for any decent person, however much of a Tory or an<br>anarchist by temperament, is to work for the establishment of Socialism.<br>Nothing else can save us from the misery of the present or the nightmare of<br>the future. To oppose Socialism now, when twenty million Englishmen are<br>underfed and Fascism has conquered half Europe, is suicidal. It is like<br>starting a civil war when the Goths are crossing the frontier.<br><br>Therefore it is all the more important to get rid of that mere nervous<br>prejudice against Socialism which is not founded on any serious objection.<br>As I have pointed out already, many people who are not repelled by<br>Socialism are repelled by Socialists. Socialism, as now presented, is<br>unattractive largely because it appears, at any rate from the outside, to<br>be the plaything of cranks, doctrinaires, parlour Bolsheviks, and so forth.<br>But it is worth remembering that this is only so because the cranks,<br>doctrinaires, etc., have been allowed to get there first J if the movement<br>were invaded by better brains and more common decency, the objectionable<br>types would cease to dominate it. For the present one must just set one's<br>teeth and ignore them; they will loom much smaller when the movement has<br>been humanized. Besides, they are irrelevant. We have got to fight for<br>justice and liberty, and Socialism does mean justice and liberty when the<br>nonsense is stripped off it. It is only the essentials that are worth<br>remembering. To recoil from Socialism because so many individual Socialists<br>are inferior people is as absurd as refusing to travel by train because you<br>dislike the ticket-collector's face.<br><br>And secondly, as to the Socialist himself--more especially the<br>vocal, tract-writing type of Socialist.<br><br>We are at a moment when it is desperately necessary for left-wingers<br>of all complexions to drop their differences and hang together. Indeed this<br>is already happening to a small extent. Obviously, then, the more<br>intransigent kind of Socialist has now got to ally himself with people who<br>are not in perfect agreement with him. As a rule he is rightly unwilling to<br>do so, because he sees the very real danger of watering the whole Socialist<br>movement down to some kind of pale-pink humbug even more ineffectual than<br>the parliamentary Labour Party. At the moment, for instance, there is great<br>danger that the Popular Front which Fascism will presumably bring into<br>existence will not be genuinely Socialist in character, but will simply be<br>a manoeuvre against German and Italian (not English) Fascism. Thus the need<br>to unite against Fascism might draw the Socialist into alliance with his<br>very worst enemies. But the principle to go upon is this: that you are<br>never in danger of allying yourself with the wrong people provided that you<br>keep the essentials of your movement in the foreground. And what are the<br>essentials of Socialism? What is the mark of a real Socialist? I suggest<br>that the real Socialist is one who wishes--not merely conceives it as<br>desirable, but actively wishes--to see tyranny overthrown. But I fancy<br>that the majority of orthodox Marxists would not accept that definition, or<br>would only accept it very grudgingly. Sometimes, when I listen to these<br>people talking, and still more when I read their books, I get the<br>impression that, to them, the whole Socialist movement is no more than a<br>kind of exciting heresy-hunt--a leaping to and fro of frenzied witch-<br>doctors to the beat of tom-toms and the tune of 'Fee fi, fo, fum, I smell<br>the blood of a right-wing deviationist!' It is because of this kind of<br>thing that it is so much easier to feel yourself a Socialist when you are<br>among working-class people. The working-class Socialist, like the working-<br>class Catholic, 's weak on doctrine and can hardly open his mouth without<br>uttering a heresy, but he has the heart of the matter in him. He does grasp<br>the central fact that Socialism means the overthrow of tyranny, and the<br>'Marseillaise', if it were translated for his benefit, would appeal to him<br>more deeply than any learned treatise on dialectical materialism. At this<br>moment it is waste of time to insist that acceptance of Socialism means<br>acceptance of the philosophic side of Marxism, plus adulation of Russia.<br>The Socialist movement has not time to be a league of dialectical<br>materialists; it has got to be a league of the oppressed against the<br>oppressors. You have got to attract the man who means business, and you<br>have got to drive away the mealy-mouthed Liberal who wants foreign Fascism<br>destroyed in order that he may go on drawing his dividends<br>peacefully--the type of hum-bug who passes resolutions 'against<br>Fascism and Communism', i.e. against rats and rat-poison. Socialism means<br>the overthrow of tyranny, at home as well as abroad. So long as you keep<br>that fact well to the front, you will never be in much doubt as to who<br>are your real supporters. As for minor differences--and the profoundest<br>philosophical difference is unimportant compared with saving the twenty<br>million Englishmen whose bones are rotting from malnutrition--the time to<br>argue about them is afterwards.<br><br>I do not think the Socialist need make any sacrifice of essentials,<br>but certainly he will have to make a great sacrifice of externals. It would<br>help enormously, for instance, if the smell of crankishness which still<br>clings to the Socialist movement could be dispelled. If only the sandals<br>and the pistachio-coloured shirts could be put in a pile and burnt, and<br>every vegetarian, teetotaller, and creeping Jesus sent home to Welwyn<br>Garden City to do his yoga exercises quietly! But that, I am afraid, is not<br>going to happen. What is possible, however, is for the more intelligent<br>kind of Socialist to stop alienating possible supporters in silly and quite<br>irrelevant ways. There are so many minor priggishness which could so easily<br>be dropped. Take for instance the dreary attitude of the typical Marxist<br>towards literature. Out of the many that come into my mind, I will give<br>just one example. It sounds trivial, but it isn't. In the old Worker's<br>Weekly (one of the forerunners of the Daily Worker) there used to be a<br>column of literary chat of the 'Books on the Editor's Table' type. For<br>several weeks miming there had been a certain amount of talk about<br>Shakespeare; whereupon an incensed reader wrote to say, 'Dear Comrade, we<br>don't want to hear about these bourgeois writers like Shakespeare. Can't<br>you give us something a bit more proletarian?' etc., etc. The editor's<br>reply was simple. 'If you will turn to the index of Marx's Capital,' he<br>wrote, 'you will find that Shakespeare is mentioned several times.' And<br>please notice that this was enough to silence the objector. Once<br>Shakespeare had received the benediction of Marx, he became respectable.<br>That is the mentality that drives ordinary sensible people away from the<br>Socialist movement. You do not need to care about Shakespeare to be<br>repelled by that kind of thing. Again, there is the horrible jargon that<br>nearly all Socialists think it necessary to employ. When the ordinary<br>person hears phrases like 'bourgeois ideology' and 'proletarian solidarity'<br>and 'expropriation of the expropriators', he is not inspired by them, he is<br>merely disgusted. Even the single word 'Comrade' has done its dirty little<br>bit towards discrediting the Socialist movement. How many a waverer has<br>halted on the brink, gone perhaps to some public meeting and watched self-<br>conscious Socialists dutifully addressing one another as 'Comrade', and<br>then slid away, disillusioned, into the nearest four-ale bar! And his<br>instinct is sound; for where is the sense of sticking on to yourself a<br>ridiculous label which even after long practice can hardly be mentioned<br>without a gulp of shame? It is fatal to let the ordinary inquirer get away<br>with the idea that being a Socialist means wearing sandals and burbling<br>about dialectical materialism. You have got to make it clear that there is<br>room in the Socialist movement for human beings, or the game is up.<br><br>And this raises a great difficulty. It means that the issue of class,<br>as distinct from mere economic status, has got to be faced more<br>realistically than it is being faced at present.<br><br>I devoted three chapters to discussing the class-difficulty. The<br>principal fact that will have emerged, I think, is that though the English<br>class-system has outlived its usefulness, it has outlived it and shows no<br>signs of dying. It greatly confuses the issue to assume, as the orthodox<br>Marxist so often does (see for instance Mr Alee Brown's in some ways<br>interesting book. The Fate of the Middle Classes), that social status is<br>determined solely by income. Economically, no doubt, there are only two<br>classes, the rich and the poor, but socially there is a whole hierarchy of<br>classes, and the manners and traditions learned by each class in childhood<br>are not only very different but--this is the essential point--generally<br>persist from birth to death. 'Hence the anomalous individuals that you find<br>in every class of society. You find writers like Wells and Bennett who have<br>grown immensely rich and have yet preserved intact their lower-middle-class<br>Nonconformist prejudices; you find millionaires who cannot pronounce their<br>aitches; you find petty shopkeepers whose income is far lower than that of<br>the bricklayer and who, nevertheless, consider themselves (and are<br>considered) the bricklayer's social superiors; you find board-school boys<br>ruling Indian provinces and public-school men touting vacuum cleaners. If<br>social stratification corresponded precisely to economic stratification,<br>the public-school man would assume a cockney accent the day his income<br>dropped below L200 a year. But does he? On the contrary, he immediately<br>becomes twenty times more Public School than before. He clings to the Old<br>School Tie as to a life-line. And even the aitchless millionaire, though<br>sometimes he goes to an elocutionist and leams a B.B.C. accent, seldom<br>succeeds in disguising himself as completely as he would like to. It is in<br>fact very difficult to escape, culturally, from the class into which you<br>have been born.<br><br>As prosperity declines, social anomalies grow commoner. You don't get<br>more aitchless millionaires, but you do get more and more public-school men<br>touting vacuum cleaners and more and more small shopkeepers driven into the<br>workhouse. Large sections of the middle class are being gradually<br>proletarianized; but the important point is that they do not, at any rate<br>in the first generation, adopt a proletarian outlook. Here am I, for<br>instance, with a bourgeois upbringing and a working-class income. Which<br>class do I belong to? Economically I belong to the working class, but it is<br>almost impossible for me to think of myself as anything but a member of the<br>bourgeoisie. And supposing I had to take sides, whom should I side with,<br>the upper class which is trying to squeeze me out of existence, or the<br>working class whose manners are not my manners? It is probable that I<br>personally, in any important issue, would side with the working class. But<br>what about the tens or hundreds of thousands of others who are in<br>approximately the same position? And what about that far larger class,<br>running into millions this time--the office-workers and black-coated<br>employees of all kinds--whose traditions are less definitely middle class<br>but who would certainly not thank you if you called them proletarians? All<br>of these people have the same interests and the same enemies as the working<br>class. All are being robbed and bullied by the same system. Yet how many of<br>them realize it? When the pinch came nearly all of them would side with<br>their oppressors and against those who ought to be their allies. It is<br>quite easy to imagine a middle class crushed down to the worst depths of<br>poverty and still remaining bitterly anti-working-class in sentiment; this<br>being, of course, a ready-made Fascist Party.<br><br>Obviously the Socialist movement has got to capture the exploited<br>middle class before it is too late; above all it must capture the office-<br>workers, who are so numerous and, if they knew how to combine, so powerful.<br>Equally obviously it has so far failed to do so. The very last person in<br>whom you can hope to find revolutionary opinions is a clerk or a commercial<br>traveller. Why? Very largely, I think, because of the 'proletarian' cant<br>with which Socialist propaganda is mixed up. In order to symbolize the<br>class war, there has been set up the more or less mythical figure of a<br>'proletarian', a muscular but downtrodden man in greasy overalls, in<br>contradistinction to a 'capitalist', a fat, wicked man in a top hat and fur<br>coat. It is tacitly assumed that there is no one in between; the truth<br>being, of course, that in a country like England about a quarter of the<br>population is in between. If you are going to harp on the 'dictatorship of<br>the proletariat', it is an elementary precaution to start by explaining who<br>the proletariat are. But because of the Socialist tendency to idealize the<br>manual worker as such, this has never been made sufficiently clear. How<br>many of the wretched shivering army of clerks and shopwalkers, who in some<br>ways are actually worse off than a miner or a dock-hand, think of<br>themselves as proletarians? A proletarian--so they have been taught to<br>think--means a man without a collar. So that when you try to move them by<br>talking about 'class war', you only succeed in scaring them; they forget<br>their incomes and remember their accents, and fly to the defence of the<br>class that is exploiting them.<br><br>Socialists have a big job ahead of them here. They have got to<br>demonstrate, beyond possibility of doubt, just where the line of cleavage<br>between exploiter and exploited comes. Once again it is a question of<br>sticking to essentials; and the essential point here is that all people<br>with small, insecure incomes are in the same boat and ought to be fighting<br>on the same side. Probably we could do with a little less talk about'<br>capitalist' and 'proletarian' and a little more about the robbers and the<br>robbed. But at any rate we must drop that misleading habit of pretending<br>that the only proletarians are manual labourers. It has got to be brought<br>home to the clerk, the engineer, the commercial traveller, the middle-class<br>man who has 'come down in the world', the village grocer, the lower-grade<br>civil servant, and all other doubtful cases that they are the proletariat,<br>and that Socialism means a fair deal for them as well as for the navvy and<br>the factory-hand. They must not be allowed to think that the battle is<br>between those who pronounce their aitches and those who don't; for if they<br>think that, they will join in on the side of the aitches.<br><br>I am implying that different classes must be persuaded to act together<br>without, for the moment, being asked to drop their class-differences. And<br>that sounds dangerous. It sounds rather too like the Duke of York's summer<br>camp and that dismal line of talk about class-cooperation and putting our<br>shoulders to the wheel, which is eyewash or Fascism, or both. There can be<br>no cooperation between classes whose real interests are opposed. The<br>capitalist cannot cooperate with the proletarian. The cat cannot cooperate<br>with the mouse; and if the cat does suggest cooperation and the mouse is<br>fool enough to agree, in a very little while the mouse will be disappearing<br>down the cat's throat. But it is always possible to cooperate so long as it<br>is upon a basis of common interests. The people who have got to act<br>together are all those who cringe to the boss and all those who shudder<br>when they think of the rent. This means that the small-holder has got to<br>ally himself with the factory-hand, the typist with the coal-miner, the<br>schoolmaster with the garage mechanic. There is some hope of getting them<br>to do so if they can be made to understand where their interest lies. But<br>this will not happen if their social prejudices, which in some of them are<br>at least as strong as any economic consideration, arc needlessly irritated.<br>There is, after all, a real difference of manners and traditions between a<br>bank clerk and a dock labourer, and the bank clerk's feeling of superiority<br>is very deeply rooted. Later on he will have to get rid of it, but this is<br>not a good moment for asking him. to do so. Therefore it would be a very<br>great advantage if that rather meaningless and mechanical bourgeois-<br>baiting, which is a part of nearly all Socialist propaganda, could be<br>dropped for the time being. Throughout left-wing thought and writing--and<br>the whole way through it, from the leading articles in the Daily Worker to<br>the comic columns in the News Chronicle--there runs an anti-genteel<br>tradition, a persistent and often very stupid gibing at genteel mannerisms<br>and genteel loyalties (or, in Communist jargon, 'bourgeois values'). It is<br>largely hum-bug, coming as it does from bourgeois-baiters who are bourgeois<br>themselves, but it does great harm, because it allows a minor issue to<br>block a major one. It directs attention away from the central fact that<br>poverty is poverty, whether the tool you work with is a pick-axe or a<br>fountain-pen.<br><br>Once again, here am I, with my middle-class origins and my income of<br>about three pounds a week from all sources. For what I am worth it would be<br>better to get me in on the Socialist side than to turn me into a Fascist.<br>But if you are constantly bullying me about my 'bourgeois ideology', if you<br>give me to understand that in some subtle way I. am an inferior person<br>because I have never worked with my hands, you will only succeed in<br>antagonizing me. For you are telling me either that I am inherently useless<br>or that I ought to alter myself in some way that is beyond my power. I<br>cannot proletarianize my accent or certain of my tastes and beliefs, and I<br>would not if I could. Why should I? I don't ask anybody else to speak my<br>dialect; why should anybody else ask me to speak his? It would be far<br>better to take those miserable class-stigmata for granted and emphasize<br>them as little as possible. They are comparable to a race-difference, and<br>experience shows that one can cooperate with foreigners, even with<br>foreigners whom one dislikes, when it is really necessary. Economically, I<br>am in the same boat with the miner, the navvy, and the farm-hand; remind me<br>of that and I will fight at their side. But culturally I am different from<br>the miner, the navvy, and the farm-hand: lay the emphasis on that and you<br>may arm me against them. If I were a solitary anomaly I should not matter,<br>but what is true of myself is true of countless others. Every bank clerk<br>dreaming of the sack, every shop-keeper teetering on the brink of<br>bankruptcy, is in essentially the same position. These are the sinking<br>middle class, and most of them are clinging to their gentility under the<br>impression that it keeps them afloat. It is not good policy to start by<br>telling them to throw away the life-belt. There is a quite obvious danger<br>that in the next few years large sections of the middle class will make a<br>sudden and violent swing to the Right. In doing so they may become<br>formidable. The weakness of the middle class hitherto has lain in the fact<br>that they have never learned to combine; but if you frighten them into<br>combining against you, you may find that you have raised up a devil. We had<br>a brief glimpse of this possibility in the General Strike.<br><br>To sum up: There is no chance of righting the conditions I described<br>in the earlier chapters of this book, or of saving England from Fascism,<br>unless we can bring an effective Socialist party into existence. It will<br>have to be a party with genuinely revolutionary intentions, and it will<br>have to be numerically strong enough to act. We can only get it if we offer<br>an objective which fairly ordinary people will recognize as desirable.<br>Beyond all else, therefore, we need intelligent propaganda. Less about<br>'class consciousness', 'expropriation of the expropriators', 'bourgeois<br>ideology', and 'proletarian solidarity', not to mention the sacred sisters,<br>thesis, antithesis, and synthesis; and more about justice, liberty, and the<br>plight of the unemployed. And less about mechanical progress, tractors, the<br>Dnieper dam, and the latest salmon-canning factory in Moscow; that kind of<br>thing is not an integral part of Socialist doctrine, and it drives away<br>many people whom the Socialist cause needs, including most of those who can<br>hold a pen. All that is needed is to hammer two facts home into the public<br>consciousness. One, that the interests of all exploited people are the<br>same; the other, that Socialism is compatible with common decency.<br><br>As for the terribly difficult issue of class-distinctions, the only<br>possible policy for the moment is to go easy and not frighten more people<br>than can be helped. And above all, no more of those muscular-curate efforts<br>at class-breaking. If you belong to the bourgeoisie, don't be too eager to<br>bound forward and embrace your proletarian brothers; they may not like it,<br>and if they show that they don't like it you will probably find that your<br>class-prejudices are not so dead as you imagined. And if you belong to the<br>proletariat, by birth or in the sight of God, don't sneer too automatically<br>at the Old School Tie; it covers loyalties which can be useful to you if<br>you know how to handle them.<br><br>Yet I believe there is some hope that when Socialism is a living<br>issue, a thing that large numbers of Englishmen genuinely care about, the<br>class-difficulty may solve itself more rapidly than now seems thinkable. In<br>the next few years we shall either get that effective Socialist party that<br>we need, or we shall not get it. If we do not get it, then Fascism is<br>coming; probably a slimy Anglicized form of Fascism, with cultured<br>policemen instead of Nazi gorillas and the lion and the unicorn instead of<br>the swastika. But if we do get it there will be a struggle, conceivably a<br>physical one, for our plutocracy will not sit quiet under a genuinely<br>revolutionary government. And when the widely separate classes who,<br>necessarily, would form any real Socialist party have fought side by side,<br>they may feel differently about one another. And then perhaps this misery<br>of class-prejudice will fade away, and we of the sinking middle class--<br>the private schoolmaster, the half-starved free-lance journalist, the<br>colonel's spinster daughter with L75 a year, the jobless Cambridge<br>graduate, the ship's officer without a ship, the clerks, the civil<br>servants, the commercial travellers, and the thrice-bankrupt drapers in the<br>country towns--may sink without further struggles into the working class<br>where we belong, and probably when we get there it will not be so dreadful<br>as we feared, for, after all, we have nothing to lose but our aitches. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/11.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center></font></p>
