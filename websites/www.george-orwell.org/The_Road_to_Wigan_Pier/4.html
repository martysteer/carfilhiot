<h2>Chapter 5</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">When you see the unemployment figures quoted at two millions, it is fatally<br>easy to take this as meaning that two million people are out of work and<br>the rest of the population is comparatively comfortable. I admit that till<br>recently I was in the habit of doing so myself. I used to calculate that if<br>you put the registered unemployed at round about two millions and threw in<br>the destitute and those who for one reason and another were not registered,<br>you might take the number of underfed people in England (for everyone on<br>the dole or thereabouts is underfed) as being, at the very most, five<br>millions.<br><br>This is an enormous under-estimate, because, in the first place, the<br>only people shown on unemployment figures are those actually drawing the<br>dole--that is, in general, heads of families. An unemployed man's<br>dependants do not figure on the list unless they too are drawing a separate<br>allowance. A Labour Exchange officer told me that to get at the real number<br>of people living on (not drawing) the dole, you have got to multiply the<br>official figures by something over three. This alone brings the number of<br>unemployed to round about six millions. But in addition there are great<br>numbers of people who are in work but who, from a financial point of view,<br>might equally well be unemployed, because they are not drawing anything<br>that can be described as a living wage.[For instance, a recent census of<br>the Lancashire cotton mills revealed the fact that over 40,000 full-time<br>employees receive less than thirty shillings a week each. In Preston,<br>to take only one town, the number receiving over thirty shillings a week<br>was 640 and the number receiving wider thirty shillings was 3113.] Allow<br>for these and their dependants, throw in as before the old-age pensioners,<br>the destitute, and other nondescripts, and you get an underfed population<br>of well over ten millions. Sir John Orr puts it at twenty millions.<br><br>Take the figures for Wigan, which is typical enough of the industrial<br>and mining districts. The number of insured workers is round about 36,000<br>(26,000 men and 10,000 women). Of these, the number unemployed at the<br>beginning of 1936 was about 10,000. But this was in winter when the mines<br>are working full time; in summer it would probably be 12,000. Multiply by<br>three, as above, and you get 30,000 or 36,000. The total population of<br>Wigan is a little under 87,000; so that at any moment more than one person<br>in three out of the whole population--not merely the registered workers<br>--is either drawing or living on the dole. Those ten or twelve thousand<br>unemployed contain a steady core of from four to five thousand miners who<br>have been continuously unemployed for the past seven years. And Wigan is<br>not especially badly off as industrial towns go. 'Even in Sheffield, which<br>has been doing well for the last year or so because of wars and rumours of<br>war, the proportion of unemployment is about the same--one in three of<br>registered workers unemployed.<br><br>When a man is first unemployed, until his insurance stamps are<br>exhausted, he draws 'full benefit', of which the rates are as follows:<br><br><br>per week<br><br>Single man 17s.<br>Wife 9s.<br>Each child below 14 3s.<br><br><br>Thus in a typical family of parents and three children of whom one was<br>over fourteen, the total income would be 32s. per week, plus anything that<br>might be earned by the eldest child. When a man's stamps are exhausted,<br>before being turned over to the P.A.C. (Public Assistance Committee), he<br>receives twenty-six weeks' 'transitional benefit' from the U.A.B.<br>(Unemployment Assistance Board), the rates being as follows:<br><br><br><br>per week<br><br>Single man 15s.<br>Man and wife 24s.<br>Children 14-18 6s.<br>Children 11-14 4s. 6d.<br>Children 8-11 4s.<br>Children 5-8 3s. 6d.<br>Children 3-5 3s.<br><br><br>Thus on the U.A.B. the income of the typical family of five persons<br>would be 37s. 6d. a week if no child was in work. When a man is on the<br>U.A.B. a quarter of his dole is regarded as rent, with a minimum of 7s. 6d.<br>a week. If the rent he is paying is more than a quarter of his dole he<br>receives an extra allowance, but if it is less than 7s. 6d., a<br>corresponding amount is deducted. Payments on the P.A.C. theoretically<br>comes out of the local rates, but are backed by a central fund. The rates<br>of benefit are:<br><br><br>per week<br><br>Single man 12s. 6d.<br>Man and wife 23s.<br>Eldest child 4s.<br>Any other child 3s.<br><br><br>Being at the discretion of the local bodies these rates vary slightly,<br>and a single man may or may not get an extra 2s. 6d. weekly, bringing his<br>benefit up to 15s. As on the U.A.B., a quarter of a married man's dole is<br>regarded as rent. Thus in the typical family considered above the total<br>income would be 33s. a week, a quarter of this being regarded as rent. In<br>addition, in most districts a coal allowance of 1s. 6d. a week (1s. 6d. is<br>equivalent to about a hundredweight of coal) is granted for six weeks<br>before and six weeks after Christmas.<br><br>It will be seen that the income of a family on the dole normally<br>averages round about thirty shillings a week. One can write at least a<br>quarter of this off as rent, which is to say that the average person, child<br>or adult, has got to be fed, clothed, warmed, and otherwise cared-for for<br>six or seven shillings a week. Enormous groups of people, probably at least<br>a third of the whole population of the industrial areas, are living at this<br>level. The Means Test is very strictly enforced, and you are liable to be<br>refused relief at the slightest hint that you are getting money from<br>another source. Dock-labourers, for instance, who are generally hired by<br>the half-day, have to sign on at a Labour Exchange twice daily; if they<br>fail to do so it is assumed that they have been working and their dole is<br>reduced correspondingly. I have seen cases of evasion of the Means Test,<br>but I should say that in the industrial towns, where there is still a<br>certain amount of communal life and everyone has neighbours who know him,<br>it is much harder than it would be in London. The usual method is for a<br>young man who is actually living with his parents to get an accommodation<br>address, so that supposedly he has a separate establishment and draws a<br>separate allowance. But there is much spying and tale-bearing. One man I<br>knew, for instance, was seen feeding his neighbour's chickens while the<br>neighbour was away. It was reported to the authorities that he 'had a job<br>feeding chickens' and he had great difficulty in refuting this. The<br>favourite joke in Wigan was about a man who was refused relief on the<br>ground that he 'had a job carting firewood'. He had been seen, it was said,<br>carting firewood at night. He had to explain that he was not carting<br>firewood but doing a moonlight flit. The 'firewood' was his furniture.<br><br>The most cruel and evil effect of the Means Test is the way in which<br>it breaks up families. Old people, sometimes bedridden, are driven out of<br>their homes by it. An old age pensioner, for instance, if a widower, would<br>normally live with one or other of his children; his weekly ten shillings<br>goes towards the household expenses, and probably he is not badly cared<br>for. Under the Means Test, however, he counts as a 'lodger' and if he stays<br>at home his children's dole will be docked. So, perhaps at seventy or<br>seventy-five years of age, he has to turn out into lodgings, handing his<br>pension over to the lodging-house keeper and existing on the verge of<br>starvation. I have seen several cases of this myself. It is happening all<br>over England at this moment, thanks to the Means Test.<br><br>Nevertheless, in spite of the frightful extent of unemployment, it is<br>a fact that poverty--extreme poverty--is less in evidence in the<br>industrial North than it is in London. Everything is poorer and shabbier,<br>there are fewer motor-cars and fewer well-dressed people; but also there<br>are fewer people who are obviously destitute. Even in a town the size of<br>Liverpool or Manchester you are struck by the fewness of the beggars.<br>London is a sort of whirlpool which draws derelict people towards it, and<br>it is so vast that life there is solitary and anonymous. Until you break<br>the law nobody will take any notice of you, and you can go to pieces as you<br>could not possibly do in a place where you had neighbours who knew you. But<br>in the industrial towns the old communal way of life has not yet broken up,<br>tradition is still strong and almost everyone has a family--potentially,<br>therefore, a home. In a town of 50,000 or 100,000 inhabitants there is no<br>casual and as it were unaccounted-for population; nobody sleeping in the<br>streets, for instance. Moreover, there is just this to be said for the<br>unemployment regulations, that they do not discourage people from marrying.<br>A man and wife on twenty-three shillings a week are not far from the<br>starvation line, but they can make a home of sorts; they are vastly better<br>off than a single man on fifteen shillings. The life of a single unemployed<br>man is dreadful. He lives sometimes in a common lodging-house, more often<br>in a 'furnished' room for which he usually pays six shillings a week,<br>finding himself as best he can on the other nine (say six shillings a week<br>for food and three for clothes, tobacco, and amusements). Of course he<br>cannot feed or look after himself properly, and a man who pays six<br>shillings a week for his room is not encouraged to be indoors more than is<br>necessary. So he spends his days loafing in the public library or any other<br>place where he can keep warm. That keeping warm--is almost the sole<br>preoccupation of a single unemployed man in winter. In Wigan a favourite<br>refuge was the pictures, which are fantastically cheap there. You can<br>always get a seat for fourpence, and at the matinee at some houses you can<br>even get a seat for twopence. Even people on the verge of starvation will<br>readily pay twopence to get out of the ghastly cold of a winter afternoon.<br>In Sheffield I was taken to a public hall to listen to a lecture by a<br>clergyman, and it was by a long way the silliest and worst-delivered<br>lecture I have ever heard or ever expect to hear. I found it physically<br>impossible to sit it out, indeed my feet carried me out, seemingly of their<br>own accord, before it was half-way through. Yet the hall was thronged with<br>unemployed men; they would have sat through far worse drivel for the sake<br>of a warm place to shelter in.<br><br>At times I have seen unmarried men on the dole living in the extreme<br>of misery. In one town I remember a whole colony of them who were<br>squatting, more or less illicitly, in a derelict house which was<br>practically falling down. They had collected a few scraps of furniture,<br>presumably off refuse-tips, and I remember that their sole table was an old<br>marble-topped wash-hand-stand. But this kind of thing is exceptional. A<br>working-class bachelor is a rarity, and so long as a man is married<br>unemployment makes comparatively little alteration in his way of life. His<br>home is impoverished but it is still a home, and it is noticeable<br>everywhere that the anomalous position created by unemployment--the man<br>being out of work while the woman's work continues as before--has not<br>altered the relative status of the sexes. In a working-class home it is the<br>man who is the master and not, as in a middle-class home, the woman or the<br>baby. Practically never, for instance, in a working-class home, will you<br>see the man doing a stroke of the housework. Unemployment has not changed<br>this convention, which on the face of it seems a little unfair. The man is<br>idle from morning to night but the woman is as busy as ever--more so,<br>indeed, because she has to manage with less money. Yet so far as my<br>experience goes the women do not protest. I believe that they, as well as<br>the men, feel that a man would lose his manhood if, merely because he was<br>out of work, he developed into a 'Mary Ann'.<br><br>But there is no doubt about the deadening, debilitating effect of<br>unemployment upon everybody, married or single, and upon men more than upon<br>women. The best intellects will not stand up against it. Once or twice it<br>has happened to me to meet unemployed men of genuine literary ability;<br>there are others whom I haven't met but whose work I occasionally see in<br>the magazines. Now and again, at long intervals, these men will produce an<br>article or a short story which is quite obviously better than most of the<br>stuff that gets whooped up by the blurb-reviewers. Why, then, do they make<br>so little use of their talents? They have all the leisure in the world; why<br>don't they sit down and write books? Because to write books you need not<br>only comfort and solitude--and solitude is never easy to attain in a<br>working-class home--you also need peace of mind. You can't settle to<br>anything, you can't command the spirit of hope in which anything has got to<br>be created, with that dull evil cloud of unemployment hanging over you.<br>Still, an unemployed man who feels at home with books can at any rate<br>occupy himself by reading. But what about the man who cannot read without<br>discomfort? Take a miner, for instance, who has worked in the pit since<br>childhood and has been trained to be a miner and nothing else. How the<br>devil is he to fill up the empty days? It is absurd to say that he ought to<br>be looking for work. There is no work to look for, and everybody knows it.<br>You can't go on looking for work every day for seven years. There are<br>allotments, which occupy the time and help to feed a family, but in a big<br>town there are only allotments for a small proportion of the people. Then<br>there are the occupational centres which were started a few years ago to<br>help the unemployed. On the whole this movement has been a failure, but<br>some of the centres are still flourishing. I have visited one or two of<br>them. There are shelters where the men can keep warm and there are<br>periodical classes in carpentering, boot-making, leather-work, handloom-<br>weaving, basket-work, sea-grass work, etc., etc.; the idea being that the<br>men can make furniture and so forth, not for sale but for their own homes,<br>getting tools free and materials cheaply. Most of the Socialists I have<br>talked to denounce this movement as they denounce the project--it is<br>always being talked about but it never comes to anything--to give the<br>unemployed small-holdings. They say that the occupational centres are<br>simply a device to keep the unemployed quiet and give them the illusion<br>that something is being done for them. Undoubtedly that is the underlying<br>motive. Keep a man busy mending boots and he is less likely to read the<br>Daily Worker. Also there is a nasty Y.M.C.A. atmosphere about these places<br>which you can feel as soon as you go in. The unemployed men who frequent<br>them are mostly of the cap-touching type--the type who tells you oilily<br>that he is 'Temperance' and votes Conservative. Yet even here you feel<br>yourself torn both ways. For probably it is better that a man should waste<br>his time even with such rubbish as sea-grass work than that for years upon<br>end he should do absolutely nothing.<br><br>By far the best work for the unemployed is being done by the<br>N.U.W.M.--National Unemployed Workers' Movement. This is a revolutionary<br>organization intended to hold the unemployed together, stop them<br>blacklegging during strikes, and give them legal advice against the Means<br>Test. It is a movement that has been built out of nothing by the pennies<br>and efforts of the unemployed themselves. I have seen a good deal of the<br>N.U.W.M., and I greatly admire the men, ragged and underfed like the<br>others, who keep the organization going. Still more I admire the tact and<br>patience with which they do it; for it is not easy to coax even a penny-a-<br>week subscription out of the pockets of people on the P.A.C. As I said<br>earlier, the English working class do not show much capacity for<br>leadership, but they have a wonderful talent for organization. The whole<br>trade union movement testifies to this; so do the excellent working-men's<br>clubs--really a sort of glorified cooperative pub, and splendidly<br>organized--which are so common in Yorkshire. In many towns the N.U.W.M.<br>have shelters and arrange speeches by Communist speakers. But even at these<br>shelters the men who go there do nothing but sit round the stove and<br>occasionally play a game of dominoes. If this move-met could be combined<br>with something along the lines of the occupational centres, it would be<br>nearer what is needed. It is a deadly thing to see a skilled man running to<br>seed, year after year, in utter, hopeless idleness. It ought not to be<br>impossible to give him the chance of using his hands and making furniture<br>and so forth for his own home, with-out turning him into a Y.M.C.A. cocoa-<br>drunkard. We may as well face the fact that several million men in England<br>will--unless another war breaks out--never have a real job this side<br>the grave. One thing that probably could be done and certainly ought to be<br>done as a matter of course is to give every unemployed man a patch of<br>ground and free tools if he chose to apply for them. It is disgraceful that<br>men who are expected to keep alive on the P.A.C. should not even have the<br>chance to grow vegetables for their families.<br><br>To study unemployment and its effects you have got to go to the<br>industrial areas. In the South unemployment exists, but it is scattered and<br>queerly unobtrusive. There are plenty of rural districts where a man out of<br>work is almost unheard-of, and you don't anywhere see the spectacle of<br>whole blocks of cities living on the dole and the P.A.C. It is only when<br>you lodge in streets where nobody has a job, where getting a job seems<br>about as probable as owning an aeroplane and much less probable than<br>winning fifty pounds in the Football Pool, that you begin to grasp the<br>changes that are being worked in our civilization. For a change is taking<br>place, there is no doubt about that. The attitude of the submerged working<br>class is profoundly different from what it was seven or eight years ago.<br><br>I first became aware of the unemployment problem in 1928. At that time<br>I had just come back from Burma, where unemployment was only a word, and I<br>had gone to Burma when I was still a boy and the post-war boom was not<br>quite over. When I first saw unemployed men at close quarters, the thing<br>that horrified and amazed me was to find that many of them were ashamed of<br>being unemployed. I was very ignorant, but not so ignorant as to imagine<br>that when the loss of foreign markets pushes two million men out of work,<br>those two million are any more to blame than the people who draw blanks in<br>the Calcutta Sweep. But at that time nobody cared to admit that<br>unemployment was inevitable, because this meant admitting that it would<br>probably continue. The middle classes were still talking about 'lazy idle<br>loafers on the dole' and saying that 'these men could all find work if they<br>wanted to', and naturally these opinions percolated to the working class<br>themselves. I remember the shock of astonishment it gave me, when I first<br>mingled with tramps and beggars, to find that a fair proportion, perhaps a<br>quarter, of these beings whom I had been taught to regard as cynical<br>parasites, were decent young miners and cotton-workers gazing at their<br>destiny with the same sort of dumb amazement as an animal in a trap. They<br>simply could not understand what was happening to them. They had been<br>brought up to work, and behold! it seemed as if they were never going to<br>have the chance of working again. In their circumstances it was inevitable,<br>at first, that they should be haunted by a feeling of personal degradation.<br>That was the attitude towards unemployment in those days: it was a disaster<br>which happened to you as an individual and for which you were to blame.<br><br>When a quarter of a million miners are unemployed, it is part of the<br>order of things that Alf Smith, a miner living in the back streets of<br>Newcastle, should be out of work. Alf Smith is merely one of the quarter<br>million, a statistical unit. But no human being finds it easy to regard<br>himself as a statistical unit. So long as Bert Jones across the street is<br>still at work, Alf Smith is bound to feel himself dishonoured and a<br>failure. Hence that frightful feeling of impotence and despair which is<br>almost the worst evil of unemployment--far worse than any hardship, worse<br>than the demoralization of enforced idleness, and Only less bad than the<br>physical degeneracy of Alf Smith's children, born on the P.A.C. Everyone<br>who saw Greenwood's play Love on the Dole must remember that dreadful<br>moment when the poor, good, stupid working man beats on the table and cries<br>out, 'O God, send me some work!' This was not dramatic exaggeration, it was<br>a touch from life. That cry must have been uttered, in almost those words,<br>in tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of English homes,<br>during the past fifteen years.<br><br>But, I think not again--or at least, not so often. That is the real<br>point: people are ceasing to kick against the pricks. After all, even the<br>middle classes--yes, even the bridge dubs in the country towns--are<br>beginning to realize that there is such a thing as unemployment. The 'My<br>dear, I don't believe in all this nonsense about unemployment. Why, only<br>last week we wanted a man to weed the garden, and we simply couldn't get<br>one. They don't want to work, that's all it is!' which you heard at every<br>decent tea-table five years ago, is growing perceptibly less frequent. As<br>for the working class themselves, they have gained immensely in economic<br>knowledge. I believe that the Daily Worker has accomplished a great deal<br>here: its influence is out of all proportion to its circulation. But in any<br>case they have had their lesson well rubbed into them, not only because<br>unemployment is so widespread but because it has lasted so long. When<br>people live on the dole for years at a time they grow used to it, and<br>drawing the dole, though it remains unpleasant, ceases to be shameful. Thus<br>the old, independent, workhouse-fearing tradition is undermined, just as<br>the ancient fear of debt is undermined by the hire-purchase system. In the<br>back streets of Wigan and Barnsley I saw every kind of privation, but I<br>probably saw much less conscious misery than I should have seen ten years<br>ago. The people have at any rate grasped that unemployment is a thing they<br>cannot help. It is not only Alf Smith who is out of work now; Bert Jones is<br>out of work as well, and both of them have been 'out' for years. It makes a<br>great deal of difference when things are the same for everybody.<br><br>So you have whole populations settling down, as it were, to a lifetime<br>on the P.A.C. And what I think is admirable, perhaps even hopeful, is that<br>they have managed to do it without going spiritually to pieces. A working<br>man does not disintegrate under the strain of poverty as a middle-class<br>person does. Take, for instance, the fact that the working class think<br>nothing of getting married on the dole. It annoys the old ladies in<br>Brighton, but it is a proof of their essential good sense; they realize<br>that losing your job does not mean that you cease to be a human being. So<br>that in one way things in the distressed areas are not as bad as they might<br>be. Life is still fairly normal, more normal than one really has the right<br>to expect. Families are impoverished, but the family-system has not broken<br>up. The people are in effect living a reduced version of their former<br>lives. Instead of raging against their destiny they have made things<br>tolerable by lowering their standards.<br><br>But they don't necessarily lower their standards by cutting I out<br>luxuries and concentrating on necessities; more often it is the other way<br>about--the more natural way, if you come to think of it. Hence the fact<br>that in a decade of unparalleled depression, the consumption of all cheap<br>luxuries has in-creased. The two things that have probably made the<br>greatest difference of all are the movies and the mass-production of cheap<br>smart clothes since the war. The youth who leaves school at fourteen and<br>gets a blind-alley job is out of work at twenty, probably for life; but for<br>two pounds ten on the hire-purchase he can buy himself a suit which, for a<br>little while and at a little distance, looks as though it had been tailored<br>in Savile Row. The girl can look like a fashion plate at an even lower<br>price. You may have three halfpence in your pocket and not a prospect in<br>the world, and only the corner of a leaky bedroom to go home to; but in<br>your new clothes you can stand on the street corner, indulging in a private<br>daydream of yourself as dark Gable or Greta Garbo, which compensates you<br>for a great deal. And even at home there is generally a cup of tea going--<br>a 'nice cup of tea'--and Father, who has been out of work since 1929, is<br>temporarily happy because he has a sure tip for the Cesarewitch.<br><br>Trade since the war has had to adjust itself to meet the demands of<br>underpaid, underfed people, with the result that a luxury is nowadays<br>almost always cheaper than a necessity. One pair of plain solid shoes costs<br>as much as two ultra-smart pairs. For the price of one square meal you can<br>get two pounds of cheap sweets. You can't get much meat for threepence, but<br>you can get a lot offish-and-chips. Milk costs threepence a pint and even<br>'mild' beer costs fourpence, but aspirins are seven a penny and you can<br>wring forty cups of tea out of a quarter-pound packet. And above all there<br>is gambling, the cheapest of all luxuries. Even people on the verge of<br>starvation can buy a few days' hope ('Something to live for', as they call<br>it) by having a penny on a sweepstake. Organized gambling has now risen<br>almost to the status of a major industry. Consider, for instance, a<br>phenomenon like the Football Pools, with a turnover of about six million<br>pounds a year, almost all of it from the pockets of working-class people. I<br>happened to be in Yorkshire when Hitler re-occupied the Rhineland. Hitler,<br>Locarno, Fascism, and the threat of war aroused hardly a flicker of<br>interest locally, but the decision of the Football Association to stop<br>publishing their fixtures in advance (this was an attempt to quell the<br>Football Pools) flung all Yorkshire into a storm of fury. And then there is<br>the queer spectacle of modern electrical science showering miracles upon<br>people with empty bellies. You may shiver all night for lack of bedclothes,<br>but in the morning you can go to the public library and read the news that<br>has been telegraphed for your benefit from San Francisco and Singapore.<br>Twenty million people are underfed but literally everyone in England has<br>access to a radio. What we have lost in food we have gained in electricity.<br>Whole sections of the working class who have been plundered of all they<br>really need are being compensated, in part, by cheap luxuries which<br>mitigate the surface of life.<br><br>Do you consider all this desirable? No, I don't. But it may be that<br>the psychological adjustment which the working class are visibly making is<br>the best they could make in the circumstances. They have neither turned<br>revolutionary nor lost their self-respect; merely they have kept their<br>tempers and settled down to make the best of things on a fish-and-chip<br>standard. The alternative would be God knows what continued agonies of<br>despair; or it might be attempted insurrections which, in a strongly<br>governed country like England, could only lead to futile massacres and a<br>regime of savage repression.<br><br>Of course the post-war development of cheap luxuries has been a very<br>fortunate thing for our rulers. It is quite likely that fish-and-chips,<br>art-silk stockings, tinned salmon, cut-price chocolate (five two-ounce bars<br>for sixpence), the movies, the radio, strong tea, and the Football Pools<br>have between them averted revolution. Therefore we are some-times told that<br>the whole thing is an astute manoeuvre by the governing class--a sort of<br>'bread and circuses' business--to hold the unemployed down. What I have<br>seen of our governing class does not convince me that they have that much<br>intelligence. The thing has happened, but by an un-conscious process--the<br>quite natural interaction between the manufacturer's need for a market and<br>the need of half-starved people for cheap palliatives.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/3.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/5.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
