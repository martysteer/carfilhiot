<h2>Chapter 9</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">When I was fourteen or fifteen I was an odious little snob, but no worse<br>than other boys of my own age and class. I suppose there is no place in the<br>world where snobbery is quite so ever-present or where it is cultivated in<br>such refined and subtle forms as in an English public school. Here at least<br>one cannot say that English 'education' fails to do its job. You forget<br>your Latin and Greek within a few months of leaving school--I studied<br>Greek for eight or ten years, and now, at thirty-three, I cannot even<br>repeat the Greek alphabet--but your snobbishness, unless you persistently<br>root it out like the bindweed it is, sticks by you till your grave.<br><br>At school I was in a difficult position, for I was among boys who, for<br>the most part, were much richer than myself, and I only went to an<br>expensive public school because I happened to win a scholarship. This is<br>the common experience of boys of the lower-upper-middle class, the sons of<br>clergymen, Anglo-Indian officials, etc., and the effects it had on me were<br>probably the usual ones. On the one hand it made me cling tighter than ever<br>to my gentility; on the other hand it filled me with resentment against the<br>boys whose parents were richer than mine and who took care to let me know<br>it. I despised anyone who was not describable as a 'gentleman', but also I<br>hated the hoggishly rich, especially those who had grown rich too recently.<br>The correct and elegant thing, I felt, was to be of gentle birth but to<br>have no money. This is part of the credo of the lower-upper-middle class.<br>It has a romantic, Jacobite-in-exile feeling about it which is very<br>comforting.<br><br>But those years, during and just after the war, were a queer time to<br>be at school, for England was nearer revolution than she has been since or<br>had been for a century earlier. Throughout almost the whole nation there<br>was running a wave of revolutionary feeling which has since been reversed<br>and forgotten, but which has left various deposits of sediment behind.<br>Essentially, though of course one could not then see it in perspective, it<br>was a revolt of youth against age, resulting directly from the war. In the<br>war the young had been sacrificed and the old had behaved in a way which,<br>even at this distance of time, is horrible to contemplate; they had been<br>sternly patriotic in safe places while their sons went down like swathes of<br>hay before the German machine guns. Moreover, the war had been conducted<br>mainly by old men and had been conducted with supreme incompetence. By 1918<br>everyone under forty was in a bad temper with his elders, and the mood of<br>anti-militarism which followed naturally upon the fighting was extended<br>into a general revolt against orthodoxy and authority. At that time there<br>was, among the young, a curious cult of hatred of 'old men'. The dominance<br>of 'old men' was held to be responsible for every evil known to humanity,<br>and every accepted institution from Scott's novels to the House of Lords<br>was derided merely because 'old men' were in favour of it. For several<br>years it was all the fashion to be a 'Bolshie', as people then called it.<br>England was full of half-baked antinomian opinions. Pacifism,<br>internationalism, humanitarianism of all kinds, feminism, free love,<br>divorce-reform, atheism, birth-control--things like these were getting a<br>better hearing than they would get in normal times. And of course the<br>revolutionary mood extended to those who had been too young to fight, even<br>to public schoolboys. At that time we all thought of ourselves as<br>enlightened creatures of a new age, casting off the orthodoxy that had been<br>forced upon us by those detested 'old men'. We retained, basically, the<br>snobbish outlook of our class, we took it for granted that we could<br>continue to draw our dividends or tumble into soft jobs, but also it seemed<br>natural to us to be 'agin the Government'.<br><br>We derided the O.T.C., the Christian religion, and perhaps even<br>compulsory games and the Royal Family, and we did not realize that we were<br>merely taking part in a world-wide gesture of distaste for war. Two<br>incidents stick in my mind as examples of the queer revolutionary feeling<br>of that time. One day the master who taught us English set us a kind of<br>general knowledge paper of which one of the questions was, 'Whom do you<br>consider the ten greatest men now living?' Of sixteen boys in the class<br>(our average age was about seventeen) fifteen included Lenin in their list.<br>This was at a snobbish expensive public school, and the date was 1920, when<br>the horrors of the Russian Revolution was still fresh in everyone's mind.<br>Also there were the so-called peace celebrations in 1919. Our elders had<br>decided for us that we should celebrate peace in the traditional manner by<br>whooping over the fallen foe. We were to march into the school-yard,<br>carrying torches, and sing jingo songs of the type of 'Rule Britannia'. The<br>boys--to their honour, I think--guyed the whole proceeding and sang<br>blasphemous and seditious words to the tunes provided. I doubt whether<br>things would happen in quite that manner now. Certainly the public<br>schoolboys I meet nowadays, even the intelligent ones, are much more right-<br>wing in their opinions than I and my contemporaries were fifteen years ago.<br><br>Hence, at the age of seventeen or eighteen, I was both a snob and a<br>revolutionary. I was against all authority. I had read and re-read the<br>entire published works of Shaw, Wells, and Galsworthy (at that time still<br>regarded as dangerously 'advanced' writers), and I loosely described myself<br>as a Socialist. But I had not much grasp of what Socialism meant, and no<br>notion that the working class were human beings. At a distance, and through<br>the medium of books--Jack London's The People of the Abyss, for instance<br>--I could agonize over their sufferings, but I still hated them and<br>despised them when I came anywhere near them. I was still revolted by their<br>accents and infuriated by their habitual rudeness. One must remember that<br>just then, immediately after the war, the English working class were in a<br>fighting mood. That was the period of the great coal strikes, when a miner<br>was thought of as a fiend incarnate and old ladies looked under their beds<br>every night lest Robert Smillie should be concealed there. All through the<br>war and for a little time afterwards there had been high wages and abundant<br>employment; things were now returning to something worse than normal, and<br>naturally the working class resisted. The men who had fought had been lured<br>into the army by gaudy promises, and now they were coming home to a world<br>where there were no jobs and not even any houses. Moreover, they had been<br>at war and were coming home with the soldier's attitude to life, which is<br>fundamentally, in spite of discipline, a lawless attitude. There was a<br>turbulent feeling in the air. To that time belongs the song with the<br>memorable refrain:<br><br><br>There's nothing sure but<br>The rich get richer and the poor get children;<br>In the mean time,<br>In between time,<br>Ain't we got fun?<br><br><br>People had not yet settled down to a lifetime of unemployment<br>mitigated by endless cups of tea. They still vaguely expected the Utopia<br>for which they had fought, and even more than before they were openly<br>hostile to the aitch-pronouncing class. So to the shock-absorbers of the<br>bourgeoisie, such as myself, 'common people' still appeared brutal and<br>repulsive. Looking back upon that period, I seem to have spent half the<br>time in denouncing the capitalist system and the other half in raging over<br>the insolence of bus-conductors.<br><br>When I was not yet twenty I went to Burma, in the Indian Imperial<br>Police. In an 'outpost of Empire' like Burma the class-question appeared at<br>first sight to have been shelved. There was no obvious class-friction here,<br>because the all-important thing was not whether you had been to one of the<br>right schools but whether your skin was technically white. As a matter of<br>fact most of the white men in Burma were not of the type who in England<br>would be called 'gentlemen', but except for the common soldiers and a few<br>nondescripts they lived lives appropriate to 'gentlemen'--had servants,<br>that is, and called their evening meal 'dinner'--and officially they were<br>regarded as being all of the same class. They were 'white men', in<br>contradistinction to the other and inferior class, the 'natives'. But one<br>did not feel towards the 'natives' as one felt to-wards the 'lower classes'<br>at home. The essential point was that the 'natives', at any rate the<br>Burmese, were not felt to be physically repulsive. One looked down on them<br>as 'natives', but one was quite ready to be physically intimate with them;<br>and this, I noticed, was the case even with white men who had the most<br>vicious colour prejudice. When you have a lot of servants you soon get into<br>lazy habits, and I habitually allowed myself, for instance, to be dressed<br>and undressed by my Burmese boy. This was because he was a Burman and<br>undisgusting; I could not have endured to let an English manservant handle<br>me in that intimate manner. I felt towards a Burman almost as I felt<br>towards a woman. Like most other races, the Burmese have a distinctive<br>smell--I cannot describe it: it is a smell that makes one's teeth tingle<br>--but this smell never disgusted me. (Incidentally, Orientals say that we<br>smell. The Chinese, I believe, say that a white man smells like a corpse.<br>The Burmese say the same--though no Burman was ever rude enough to say so<br>to me.) And in a way my attitude was defensible, for if one faces the fact<br>one must admit that most Mongolians have much nicer bodies than most white<br>men. Compare the firm-knit silken skin of the Burman, which does not<br>wrinkle at all till he is past forty, and then merely withers up like a<br>piece of dry leather, with the coarse-grained, flabby, sagging skin of the<br>white man. The white man has lank ugly hair growing down his legs and the<br>backs of his arms and in an ugly patch on his chest. The Burman has only a<br>tuft or two of stiff black hair at the appropriate places; for the rest he<br>is quite hairless and is usually beardless as well. The white man almost<br>always goes bald, the Burman seldom or never. The Burman's teeth are<br>perfect, though generally discoloured by betel juice, the white man's teeth<br>invariably decay. The white man is generally ill-shaped, and when he grows<br>fat he bulges in improbable places; the Mongol has beautiful bones and in<br>old age he is almost as shapely as in youth. Admittedly the white races<br>throw up a few individuals who for a few years are supremely beautiful; but<br>on the whole, say what you will, they are far less comely than Orientals.<br>But it was not of this that I was thinking when I found the English 'lower<br>classes' so much more repellant than Burmese 'natives'. I was still<br>thinking in terms of my early-acquired class-prejudice. When I was not much<br>past twenty I was attached for a short time to a British regiment. Of<br>course I admired and liked the private soldiers as any youth of twenty<br>would admire and like hefty, cheery youths five years older than himself<br>with the medals of the Great War on their chests. And yet, after all, they<br>faintly repelled me; they were 'common people' and I did not care to be too<br>close to them. In the hot mornings when the company marched down the road,<br>myself in the rear with one of the junior subalterns, the steam of those<br>hundred sweating bodies in front made my stomach turn. And this, you<br>observe, was pure prejudice. For a soldier is probably as inoffensive,<br>physically, as it is possible for a male white person to be. He is<br>generally young, he is nearly always healthy from fresh air and exercise,<br>and a rigorous discipline compels him to be clean. But I could not see it<br>like that. All I knew was that it was lower-class sweat that I was<br>smelling, and the thought of it made me sick.<br><br>When later on I got rid of my class-prejudice, or part of it, it was<br>in a roundabout way and by a process that took several years. The thing<br>that changed my attitude to the class-issue was something only indirectly<br>connected with it--something almost irrelevant.<br><br>I was in the Indian Police five years, and by the end of that time I<br>hated the imperialism I was serving with a bitterness which I probably<br>cannot make clear. In the free air of England that kind of thing is not<br>fully intelligible. In order to hate imperialism you have got to be part of<br>it. Seen from the outside the British rule in India appears--indeed, it<br>is--benevolent and even necessary; and so no doubt are the French rule in<br>Morocco and the Dutch rule in Borneo, for people usually govern foreigners<br>better than they govern themselves. But it is not possible to be a part of<br>such a system without recognizing it as an unjustifiable tyranny. Even the<br>thickest-skinned Anglo-Indian is aware of this. Every 'native' face he sees<br>in the street brings home to him his monstrous intrusion. And the majority<br>of Anglo-Indians, intermittently at least, are not nearly so complacent<br>about their position as people in England believe. From the most unexpected<br>people, from gin-pickled old scoundrels high up in the Government service,<br>I have heard some such remark as: 'Of course we've no right in this blasted<br>country at all. Only now we're here for God's sake let's stay here.' The<br>truth is that no modem man, in his heart of hearts, believes that it is<br>right to invade a foreign country and hold the population down by force.<br>Foreign oppression is a much more obvious, understandable evil than<br>economic oppression. Thus in England we tamely admit to being robbed in<br>order to keep half a million worthless idlers in luxury, but we would fight<br>to the last man sooner than be rilled by Chinamen; similarly, people who<br>live on unearned dividends without a single qualm of conscience, see<br>clearly enough that it is wrong to go and lord it in a foreign country<br>where you are not wanted. The result is that every Anglo-Indian is haunted<br>by a sense of guilt which he usually conceals as best he can, because there<br>is no freedom of speech, and merely to be overheard making a seditious<br>remark may damage his career. All over India there are Englishmen who<br>secretly loathe the system of which they are part; and just occasionally,<br>when they are quite certain of being in the right company, their hidden<br>bitterness overflows. I remember a night I spent on the train with a man in<br>the Educational Service, a stranger to myself whose name I never<br>discovered. It was too hot to sleep and we spent the night in talking. Half<br>an hour's cautious questioning decided each of us that the other was<br>'safe'; and then for hours, while the train jolted slowly through the<br>pitch-black night, sitting up in our bunks with bottles of beer handy, we<br>damned the British Empire--damned it from the inside, intelligently and<br>intimately. It did us both good. But we had been speaking forbidden things,<br>and in the haggard morning light when the train crawled into Mandalay, we<br>parted as guiltily as any adulterous couple.<br><br>So far as my observation goes nearly all Anglo-Indian officials have<br>moments when their conscience troubles them. The exceptions are men who are<br>doing something which is demonstrably useful and would still have to be<br>done whether the British were in India or not: forest officers, for<br>instance, and doctors and engineers. But I was in the police, which is to<br>say that I was part of the actual machinery of despotism. Moreover, in the<br>police you see the dirty work of Empire at close quarters, and there is an<br>appreciable difference between doing dirty work and merely profiting by it.<br>Most people approve of capital punishment, but most people wouldn't do the<br>hangman's job. Even the other Europeans in Burma slightly looked down on<br>the police because of the brutal work they had to do. I remember once when<br>I was inspecting a police station, an American missionary whom I knew<br>fairly well came in for some purpose or other. Like most Nonconformist<br>missionaries he was a complete ass but quite a good fellow. One of my<br>native sub-inspectors was bullying a suspect (I described this scene in<br>Burmese Days). The American watched it, and then turning to me said<br>thoughtfully, 'I wouldn't care to have your job.' It made me horribly<br>ashamed. So that was the kind of job I had! Even an ass of an American<br>missionary, a teetotal cock-virgin from the Middle West, had the right to<br>look down on me and pity me! But I should have felt the same shame even if<br>there had been no one to bring it home to me. I had begun to have an<br>indescribable loathing of the whole machinery of so-called justice. Say<br>what you will, pur criminal law (far more humane, by the way, in India than<br>in England) is a horrible thing. It needs very insensitive people to<br>administer it. The wretched prisoners squatting in the reeking cages of the<br>lock-ups, the grey cowed faces of the long-term convicts, the scarred<br>buttocks of the men who had been flogged with bamboos, the women and<br>children howling when their menfolk were led away under arrest--things<br>like these are beyond bearing when you are in any way directly responsible<br>for them. I watched a man hanged once; it seemed to me worse than a<br>thousand murders. I never went into a jail without feeling (most visitors<br>to jails feel the same) that my place was on the other side of the bars. I<br>thought then--I think now, for that matter--that the worst criminal who<br>ever walked is morally superior to a hanging judge. But of course I had to<br>keep these notions to myself, because of the almost utter silence that is<br>imposed on every Englishman in the East. In the end I worked out an<br>anarchistic theory that all government is evil, that the punishment always<br>does more harm than the crime and that people can be trusted to behave<br>decently if only you will let them alone. This of course was sentimental<br>nonsense. I see now as I did not see then, that it is always necessary to<br>protect peaceful people from violence. In any state of society where crime<br>can be profitable you have got to have a harsh criminal law and administer<br>it ruthlessly; the alternative is Al Capone. But the feeling that<br>punishment is evil arises inescapably in those who have to administer it. I<br>should expect to find that even in England many policemen, judges, prison<br>warders, and the like are haunted by a secret horror of what they do. But<br>in Burma it was a double oppression that we were committing. Not only were<br>we hanging people and putting them in jail and so forth; we were doing it<br>in the capacity of unwanted foreign invaders. The Burmese themselves never<br>really recognized our jurisdiction. The thief whom we put in prison did not<br>think of himself as a criminal justly punished, he thought of himself as<br>the victim of a foreign conqueror. The thing that was done to him was<br>merely a wanton meaningless cruelty. His face, behind the stout teak bars<br>of the lock-up and the iron bars of the jail, said so clearly. And<br>unfortunately I had not trained myself to be indifferent to the expression<br>of the human face.<br><br>When I came home on leave in 1927 I was already half determined to<br>throw up my job, and one sniff of English air decided me. I was not going<br>back to be a part of that evil despotism. But I wanted much more than<br>merely to escape from my job. For five years I had been part of an<br>oppressive system, and it had left me with a bad conscience. Innumerable<br>remembered faces--faces of prisoners in the dock, of men waiting in the<br>condemned cells, of subordinates I had bullied and aged peasants I had<br>snubbed, of servants and coolies I had hit with my fist in moments of rage<br>(nearly everyone does these things in the East, at any rate occasionally:<br>Orientals can be very provoking)--haunted me intolerably. I was conscious<br>of an immense weight of guilt that I had got to expiate. I suppose that<br>sounds exaggerated; but if you do for five years a job that you thoroughly<br>disapprove of, you will probably feel the same. I had reduced everything to<br>the simple theory that the oppressed are always right and the oppressors<br>are always wrong: a mistaken theory, but the natural result of being one of<br>the oppressors yourself. I felt that I had got to escape not merely from<br>imperialism but from every form of man's dominion over man. I wanted to<br>submerge myself, to get right down among the oppressed, to be one of them<br>and on their side against their tyrants. And, chiefly because I had had to.<br>think everything out in solitude, I had carried my hatred of oppression to<br>extraordinary lengths. At that time failure seemed to me to be the only<br>virtue. Every suspicion of self-advancement, even to 'succeed' in life to<br>the extent of making a few hundreds a year, seemed to me spiritually ugly,<br>a species of bullying.<br><br>It was in this way that my thoughts turned towards the English working<br>class. It was the first time that I had ever been really aware of the<br>working class, and to begin with it was only because they supplied an<br>analogy. They were the symbolic victims of injustice, playing the same part<br>in England as the Burmese played in Burma. In Burma the issue had been<br>quite simple. The whites were up and the blacks were down, and therefore as<br>a matter of course one's sympathy was with the blacks. I now realized that<br>there was no need to go as far as Burma to find tyranny and exploitation.<br>Here in England, down under one's feet, were the submerged working class,<br>suffering miseries which in their different way were as bad as any an<br>Oriental ever knows. The word 'unemployment' was on everyone's lips. That<br>was more or less new to me, after Burma, but the driyel which the middle<br>classes were still talking ('These unemployed are all unemployables', etc.,<br>etc.) failed to deceive me. I often wonder whether that kind of stuff<br>deceives even the fools who utter it. On the other hand I had at that time<br>no interest in Socialism or any other economic theory. It seemed to me then<br>--it sometimes seems to me now, for that matter--that economic injustice<br>will stop the moment we want it to stop, and no sooner, and if we genuinely<br>want it to stop the method adopted hardly matters.<br><br>But I knew nothing about working-class conditions. I had read the<br>unemployment figures but I had no notion of what they implied; above all, I<br>did not know the essential fact that 'respectable' poverty is always the<br>worst. The frightful doom of a decent working man suddenly thrown on the<br>streets after a lifetime of steady work, his agonized struggles against<br>economic laws which he does not under-stand, the disintegration of<br>families, the corroding sense of shame--all this was outside the range of<br>my experience. When I thought of poverty I thought of it in terms of brute<br>starvation. Therefore my mind turned immediately towards the extreme cases,<br>the social outcasts: tramps, beggars, criminals, prostitutes. These were<br>'the lowest of the low', and these were the people with whom I wanted to<br>get in contact. What I profoundly wanted, at that time, was to find some<br>way of getting out of the respectable world altogether. I meditated upon it<br>a great deal, I even planned parts of it in detail; how one could sell<br>everything, give everything away, change one's name and start out with no<br>money and nothing but the clothes one stood up in. But in real life nobody<br>ever does that kind of thing; apart from the relatives and friends who have<br>to be considered, it is doubtful whether an educated man could do it if<br>there were any other course open to him. But at least I could go among<br>these people, see what their lives were like and feel myself temporarily<br>part of their world. Once I had been among them and accepted by them, I<br>should have touched bottom, and--this is what I felt: I was aware even<br>then that it was irrational--part of my guilt would drop from me.<br><br>I thought it over and decided what I would do. I would go suitably<br>disguised to Limehouse and Whitechapel and such places and sleep in common<br>lodging-houses and pal up with dock labourers, street hawkers, derelict<br>people, beggars, and, if possible, criminals. And I would find out about<br>tramps and how you got in touch with them and what was the proper procedure<br>for entering the casual ward; and then, when I felt that I knew the ropes<br>well enough, I would go on the road myself.<br><br>At the start it was not easy. It meant masquerading and I have no<br>talent for acting. I cannot, for instance, disguise my accent, at any rate<br>not for more than a very few minutes. I imagined--notice the frightful<br>class-conscious-ness of the Englishman--that I should be spotted as a<br>'gentleman' the moment I opened my mouth; so I had a hard luck story ready<br>in case I should be questioned, I got hold of the right kind of clothes and<br>dirtied them in appropriate places. I am a difficult person to disguise,<br>being abnormally tall, but I did at least know what a tramp looks like.<br>(How few people do know this, by the way! Look at any picture of a tramp in<br>Punch. They are always twenty years out of date.) One evening, having made<br>ready at a friend's house, I set out and wandered eastward till I landed up<br>at a common lodging-house in Limehouse Cause-way. It was a dark, dirty-<br>looking place. I knew it was a common lodging-house by the sign 'Good Beds<br>for Single Men' in the window. Heavens, how I had to screw up my courage<br>before I went in! It seems ridiculous now. But you see I was still half<br>afraid of the working class. I wanted to get in touch with them, I even<br>wanted to become one of them, but I still thought of them as alien and<br>dangerous; going into the dark doorway of that common lodging-house seemed<br>to me like going down into some dreadful subterranean place--a sewer full<br>of rats, for instance. I went in fully expecting a fight. The people would<br>spot that I was not one of themselves and immediately infer that I had come<br>to spy on them; and then they would set upon me and throw me out--that<br>was what I expected. I felt that I had got to do it, but I did not enjoy<br>the prospect.<br><br>Inside the door a man in shirt-sleeves appeared from somewhere or<br>other. This was the 'deputy', and I told him that I wanted a bed for the<br>night. My accent did not make him stare, I noticed; he merely demanded<br>ninepence and then showed me the way to a frowsy firelit kitchen<br>underground. There were stevedores and navvies and a few sailors sitting<br>about and playing draughts and drinking tea. They barely glanced at me as I<br>entered. But this was Saturday night and a hefty young stevedore was drunk<br>and was reeling about the room. He turned, saw me, and lurched towards me<br>with broad red face thrust out and a dangerous-looking fishy gleam in his<br>eyes. I stiffened myself. So the fight was coming already! The next moment<br>the stevedore collapsed on my chest and flung his arms round my neck. ''Ave<br>a cup of tea, chum!' he cried tear-fully; ''ave a cup of tea!'<br><br>I had a cup of tea. It was a kind of baptism. After that my fears<br>vanished. Nobody questioned me, nobody showed offensive curiosity;<br>everybody was polite and gentle and took me utterly for granted. I stayed<br>two or three days in that common lodging-house, and a few weeks later,<br>having picked up a certain amount of information about the habits of<br>destitute people, I went on the road for the first time.<br><br>I have described all this in Down and Out in Paris and London (nearly<br>all the incidents described there actually happened, though they have been<br>rearranged) and I do not want to repeat it. Later I went on the road for<br>much longer periods, sometimes from choice, sometimes from necessity. I<br>have lived in common lodging-houses for months together. But it is that<br>first expedition that sticks most vividly in my mind, because of the<br>strangeness of it--the strangeness of being at last down there among 'the<br>lowest of the low', and on terms of utter equality with working-class<br>people. A tramp, it is true, is not a typical working-class person; still,<br>when you are among tramps you are at any rate merged in one section--one<br>sub-caste--of the working class, a thing which so far as I know can<br>happen to you in no other way. For several days I wandered through the<br>northern outskirts of London with an Irish tramp. I was his mate,<br>temporarily. We shared the same cell at night, and he told me the history<br>of his life and I told him a fictitious history of mine, and we took it in<br>turns to beg at likely-looking houses and divided up the proceeds. I was<br>very happy. Here I was; among 'the lowest of the low', at the bedrock of<br>the Western world! The class-bar was down, or seemed to be down. And down<br>there in the squalid and, as a matter of fact, horribly boring sub-world of<br>the tramp I had a feeling of release, of adventure, which seems absurd when<br>I look back, but which was sufficiently vivid at the time. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/7.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_To_Wigan_Pier/9.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
