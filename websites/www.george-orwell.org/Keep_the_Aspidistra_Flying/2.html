<h2>Chapter 2</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Gordon walked homeward against the rattling wind, which blew his<br>hair backward and gave him more of a 'good' forehead than ever.<br>His manner conveyed to the passers-by--at least, he hoped it did--<br>that if he wore no overcoat it was from pure caprice. His overcoat<br>was up the spout for fifteen shillings, as a matter of fact.<br><br>Willowbed Road, NW, was not definitely slummy, only dingy and<br>depressing. There were real slums hardly five minutes' walk away.<br>Tenement houses where families slept five in a bed, and, when one<br>of them died, slept every night with the corpse until it was<br>buried; alley-ways where girls of fifteen were deflowered by boys<br>of sixteen against leprous plaster walls. But Willowbed Road<br>itself contrived to keep up a kind of mingy, lower-middle-class<br>decency. There was even a dentist's brass plate on one of the<br>houses. In quite two-thirds of them, amid the lace curtains of the<br>parlour window, there was a green card with 'Apartments' on it in<br>silver lettering, above the peeping foliage of an aspidistra.<br><br>Mrs Wisbeach, Gordon's landlady, specialized in 'single gentlemen'.<br>Bed-sitting-rooms, with gaslight laid on and find your own heating,<br>baths extra (there was a geyser), and meals in the tomb-dark<br>dining-room with the phalanx of clotted sauce-bottles in the middle<br>of the table. Gordon, who came home for his midday dinner, paid<br>twenty-seven and six a week.<br><br>The gaslight shone yellow through the frosted transom above the<br>door of Number 31. Gordon took out his key and fished about in the<br>keyhole--in that kind of house the key never quite fits the lock.<br>The darkish little hallway--in reality it was only a passage--smelt<br>of dishwater, cabbage, rag mats, and bedroom slops. Gordon glanced<br>at the japanned tray on the hall-stand. No letters, of course. He<br>had told himself not to hope for a letter, and nevertheless had<br>continued to hope. A stale feeling, not quite a pain, settled upon<br>his breast. Rosemary might have written! It was four days now<br>since she had written. Moreover, there were a couple of poems that<br>he had sent out to magazines and had not yet had returned to him.<br>The one thing that made the evening bearable was to find a letter<br>waiting for him when he got home. But he received very few<br>letters--four or five in a week at the very most.<br><br>On the left of the hall was the never-used parlour, then came the<br>staircase, and beyond that the passage ran down to the kitchen and<br>to the unapproachable lair inhabited by Mrs Wisbeach herself. As<br>Gordon came in, the door at the end of the passage opened a foot or<br>so. Mrs Wisbeach's face emerged, inspected him briefly but<br>suspiciously, and disappeared again. It was quite impossible to<br>get in or out of the house, at any time before eleven at night,<br>without being scrutinized in this manner. Just what Mrs Wisbeach<br>suspected you of it was hard to say; smuggling women into the<br>house, possibly. She was one of those malignant respectable women<br>who keep lodging-houses. Age about forty-five, stout but active,<br>with a pink, fine-featured, horribly observant face, beautifully<br>grey hair, and a permanent grievance.<br><br>Gordon halted at the foot of the narrow stairs. Above, a coarse<br>rich voice was singing, 'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?' A very<br>fat man of thirty-eight or nine came round the angle of the stairs,<br>with the light dancing step peculiar to fat men, dressed in a smart<br>grey suit, yellow shoes, a rakish trilby hat, and a belted blue<br>overcoat of startling vulgarity. This was Flaxman, the first-floor<br>lodger and travelling representative of the Queen of Sheba Toilet<br>Requisites Co. He saluted Gordon with a lemon-coloured glove as he<br>came down.<br><br>'Hullo, chappie!' he said blithely. (Flaxman called everyone<br>'chappie'.) 'How's life with you?'<br><br>'Bloody,' said Gordon shortly.<br><br>Flaxman had reached the bottom of the stairs. He threw a roly-poly<br>arm affectionately round Gordon's shoulders.<br><br>'Cheer up, old man, cheer up! You look like a bloody funeral. I'm<br>off down to the Crichton. Come on down and have a quick one.'<br><br>'I can't. I've got to work.'<br><br>'Oh, hell! Be matey, can't you? What's the good of mooning about<br>up here? Come on down to the Cri and we'll pinch the barmaid's<br>bum.'<br><br>Gordon wriggled free of Flaxman' s arm. Like all small frail<br>people, he hated being touched. Flaxman merely grinned, with the<br>typical fat man's good humour. He was really horribly fat. He<br>filled his trousers as though he had been melted and then poured<br>into them. But of course, like other fat people, he never admitted<br>to being fat. No fat person ever uses the word 'fat' if there is<br>any way of avoiding it. 'Stout' is the word they use--or, better<br>still, 'robust'. A fat man is never so happy as when he is<br>describing himself as 'robust'. Flaxman, at his first meeting with<br>Gordon, had been on the point of calling himself 'robust', but<br>something in Gordon's greenish eye had deterred him. He compromised<br>on 'stout' instead.<br><br>'I do admit, chappie,' he said, 'to being--well, just a wee bit on<br>the stout side. Nothing unwholesome, you know.' He patted the<br>vague frontier between his belly and his chest. 'Good firm flesh.<br>I'm pretty nippy on my feet, as a matter of fact. But--well, I<br>suppose you might call me STOUT.'<br><br>'Like Cortez,' Gordon suggested.<br><br>'Cortez? Cortez? Was that the chappie who was always wandering<br>about in the mountains in Mexico?'<br><br>'That's the fellow. He was stout, but he had eagle eyes.'<br><br>'Ah? Now that's funny. Because the wife said something rather<br>like that to me once. "George," she said, "you've got the most<br>wonderful eyes in the world. You've got eyes just like an eagle,"<br>she said. That would be before she married me, you'll understand.'<br><br>Flaxman was living apart from his wife at the moment. A little<br>while back the Queen of Sheba Toilet Requisites Co. had<br>unexpectedly paid out a bonus of thirty pounds to all its<br>travellers, and at the same time Flaxman and two others had been<br>sent across to Paris to press the new Sexapeal Naturetint lipstick<br>on various French firms. Flaxman had not thought it necessary to<br>mention the thirty pounds to his wife. He had had the time of his<br>life on that Paris trip, of course. Even now, three months<br>afterwards, his mouth watered when he spoke of it. He used to<br>entertain Gordon with luscious descriptions. Ten days in Paris<br>with thirty quid that wifie hadn't heard about! Oh boy! But<br>unfortunately there had been a leakage somewhere; Flaxman had got<br>home to find retribution awaiting him. His wife had broken his<br>head with a cut-glass whisky decanter, a wedding present which they<br>had had for fourteen years, and then fled to her mother's house,<br>taking the children with her. Hence Flaxman's exile in Willowbed<br>Road. But he wasn't letting it worry him. It would blow over, no<br>doubt; it had happened several times before.<br><br>Gordon made another attempt to get past Flaxman and escape up the<br>stairs. The dreadful thing was that in his heart he was pining to<br>go with him. He needed a drink so badly--the mere mention of the<br>Crichton Arms had made him feel thirsty. But it was impossible, of<br>course; he had no money. Flaxman put an arm across the stairs,<br>barring his way. He was genuinely fond of Gordon. He considered<br>him 'clever'--'cleverness', to him, being a kind of amiable lunacy.<br>Moreover, he detested being alone, even for so short a time as it<br>would take him to walk to the pub.<br><br>'Come on, chappie!' he urged. 'You want a Guinness to buck you up,<br>that's what you want. You haven't seen the new girl they've got in<br>the saloon bar yet. Oh, boy! There's a peach for you!'<br><br>'So that's why you're all dolled up, is it?' said Gordon, looking<br>coldly at Flaxman's yellow gloves.<br><br>'You bet it is, chappie! Coo, what a peach! Ash blonde she is.<br>And she knows a thing or two, that girlie does. I gave her a stick<br>of our Sexapeal Naturetint last night. You ought to have seen her<br>wag her little bottom at me as she went past my table. Does she<br>give me the palpitations? Does she? Oh, boy!'<br><br>Flaxman wriggled lascivously. His tongue appeared between his<br>lips. Then, suddenly pretending that Gordon was the ash-blonde<br>barmaid, he seized him by the waist and gave him a tender squeeze.<br>Gordon shoved him away. For a moment the desire to go down to the<br>Crichton Arms was so ravishing that it almost overcame him. Oh,<br>for a pint of beer! He seemed almost to feel it going down his<br>throat. If only he had had any money! Even sevenpence for a pint.<br>But what was the use? Twopence halfpenny in pocket. You can't let<br>other people buy your drinks for you.<br><br>'Oh, leave me alone, for God's sake!' he said irritably, stepping<br>out of Flaxman's reach, and went up the stairs without looking<br>back.<br><br>Flaxman settled his hat on his head and made for the front door,<br>mildly offended. Gordon reflected dully that it was always like<br>this nowadays. He was for ever snubbing friendly advances. Of<br>course it was money that was at the bottom of it, always money.<br>You can't be friendly, you can't even be civil, when you have no<br>money in your pocket. A spasm of self-pity went through him. His<br>heart yearned for the saloon bar at the Crichton; the lovely smell<br>of beer, the warmth and bright lights, the cheery voices, the<br>clatter of glasses on the beer-wet bar. Money, money! He went on,<br>up the dark evil-smelling stairs. The thought of his cold lonely<br>bedroom at the top of the house was like a doom before him.<br><br>On the second floor lived Lorenheim, a dark, meagre, lizard-like<br>creature of uncertain age and race, who made about thirty-five<br>shillings a week by touting vacuum-cleaners. Gordon always went<br>very hurriedly past Lorenheim's door. Lorenheim was one of those<br>people who have not a single friend in the world and who are<br>devoured by a lust for company. His loneliness was so deadly that<br>if you so much as slowed your pace outside his door he was liable<br>to pounce out upon you and half drag, half wheedle you in to listen<br>to interminable paranoiac tales of girls he had seduced and<br>employers he had scored off. And his room was more cold and<br>squalid than even a lodging-house bedroom has any right to be.<br>There were always half-eaten bits of bread and margarine lying<br>about everywhere. The only other lodger in the house was an<br>engineer of some kind, employed on nightwork. Gordon only saw him<br>occasionally--a massive man with a grim, discoloured face, who wore<br>a bowler hat indoors and out.<br><br>In the familiar darkness of his room, Gordon felt for the gas-jet<br>and lighted it. The room was medium-sized, not big enough to be<br>curtained into two, but too big to be sufficiently warmed by one<br>defective oil lamp. It had the sort of furniture you expect in a<br>top floor back. White-quilted single-bed; brown lino floor-<br>covering; wash-hand-stand with jug and basin of that cheap white<br>ware which you can never see without thinking of chamberpots. On<br>the window-sill there was a sickly aspidistra in a green-glazed<br>pot.<br><br>Up against this, under the window, there was a kitchen table with<br>an inkstained green cloth. This was Gordon's 'writing' table. It<br>was only after a bitter struggle that he had induced Mrs Wisbeach<br>to give him a kitchen table instead of the bamboo 'occasional'<br>table--a mere stand for the aspidistra--which she considered proper<br>for a top floor back. And even now there was endless nagging<br>because Gordon would never allow his table to be 'tidied up'. The<br>table was in a permanent mess. It was almost covered with a muddle<br>of papers, perhaps two hundred sheets of sermon paper, grimy and<br>dog-eared, and all written on and crossed out and written on again--<br>a sort of sordid labyrinth of papers to which only Gordon possessed<br>the key. There was a film of dust over everything, and there were<br>several foul little trays containing tobacco ash and the twisted<br>stubs of cigarettes. Except for a few books on the mantelpiece,<br>this table, with its mess of papers, was the sole mark Gordon's<br>personality had left on the room.<br><br>It was beastly cold. Gordon thought he would light the oil lamp.<br>He lifted it--it felt very light; the spare oil can also was empty--<br>no oil till Friday. He applied a match; a dull yellow flame crept<br>unwillingly round the wick. It might burn for a couple of hours,<br>with any luck. As Gordon threw away the match his eye fell upon<br>the aspidistra in its grass-green pot. It was a peculiarly mangy<br>specimen. It had only seven leaves and never seemed to put forth<br>any new ones. Gordon had a sort of secret feud with the<br>aspidistra. Many a time he had furtively attempted to kill it--<br>starving it of water, grinding hot cigarette-ends against its stem,<br>even mixing salt with its earth. But the beastly things are<br>practically immortal. In almost any circumstances they can<br>preserve a wilting, diseased existence. Gordon stood up and<br>deliberately wiped his kerosiny fingers on the aspidistra leaves.<br><br>At this moment Mrs Wisbeach's voice rang shrewishly up the stairs:<br><br>'Mister Com-stock!'<br><br>Gordon went to the door. 'Yes?' he called down.<br><br>'Your supper's been waiting for you this ten minutes. Why can't<br>you come down and have it, 'stead of keeping me waiting for the<br>washing up?'<br><br>Gordon went down. The dining-room was on the first floor, at the<br>back, opposite Flaxman's room. It was a cold, close-smelling room,<br>twilit even at midday. There were more aspidistras in it than<br>Gordon had ever accurately counted. They were all over the place--<br>on the sideboard, on the floor, on 'occasional' tables; in the<br>window there was a sort of florist's stand of them, blocking out<br>the light. In the half-darkness, with aspidistras all about you,<br>you had the feeling of being in some sunless aquarium amid the<br>dreary foliage of water-flowers. Gordon's supper was set out,<br>waiting for him, in the circle of white light that the cracked gas-<br>jet cast upon the table cloth. He sat down with his back to the<br>fireplace (there was an aspidistra in the grate instead of a fire)<br>and ate his plate of cold beef and his two slices of crumbly white<br>bread, with Canadian butter, mousetrap cheese and Pan Yan pickle,<br>and drank a glass of cold but musty water.<br><br>When he went back to his room the oil lamp had got going, more or<br>less. It was hot enough to boil a kettle by, he thought. And now<br>for the great event of the evening--his illicit cup of tea. He<br>made himself a cup of tea almost every night, in the deadliest<br>secrecy. Mrs Wisbeach refused to give her lodgers tea with their<br>supper, because she 'couldn't be bothered with hotting up extra<br>water', but at the same time making tea in your bedroom was<br>strictly forbidden. Gordon looked with disgust at the muddled<br>papers on the table. He told himself defiantly that he wasn't<br>going to do any work tonight. He would have a cup of tea and smoke<br>up his remaining cigarettes, and read King Lear or Sherlock Holmes.<br>His books were on the mantelpiece beside the alarm clock--<br>Shakespeare in the Everyman edition, Sherlock Holmes, Villon's<br>poems, Roderick Random, Les Fleurs du Mal, a pile of French novels.<br>But he read nothing nowadays, except Shakespeare and Sherlock<br>Holmes. Meanwhile, that cup of tea.<br><br>Gordon went to the door, pushed it ajar, and listened. No sound of<br>Mrs Wisbeach. You had to be very careful; she was quite capable of<br>sneaking upstairs and catching you in the act. This tea-making was<br>the major household offence, next to bringing a woman in. Quietly<br>he bolted the door, dragged his cheap suitcase from under the bed,<br>and unlocked it. From it he extracted a sixpenny Woolworth's<br>kettle, a packet of Lyons' tea, a tin of condensed milk, a tea-pot,<br>and a cup. They were all packed in newspaper to prevent them from<br>chinking.<br><br>He had his regular procedure for making tea. First he half filled<br>the kettle with water from the jug and set it on the oil stove.<br>Then he knelt down and spread out a piece of newspaper. Yesterday's<br>tea-leaves were still in the pot, of course. He shook them out on<br>to the newspaper, cleaned out the pot with his thumb and folded the<br>leaves into a bundle. Presently he would smuggle them downstairs.<br>That was always the most risky part--getting rid of the used<br>tea-leaves. It was like the difficulty murderers have in disposing<br>of the body. As for the cup, he always washed it in his hand basin<br>in the morning. A squalid business. It sickened him, sometimes.<br>It was queer how furtively you had to live in Mrs Wisbeach's house.<br>You had the feeling that she was always watching you; and indeed,<br>she was given to tiptoeing up and downstairs at all hours, in hope<br>of catching the lodgers up to mischief. It was one of those houses<br>where you cannot even go to the W.C. in peace because of the<br>feeling that somebody is listening to you.<br><br>Gordon unbolted the door again and listened intently. No one<br>stirring. Ah! A clatter of crockery far below. Mrs Wisbeach was<br>washing up the supper things. Probably safe to go down, then.<br><br>He tiptoed down, clutching the damp bundle of tea-leaves against<br>his breast. The W.C. was on the second floor. At the angle of<br>the stairs he halted, listened a moment longer. Ah! Another<br>clatter of crockery.<br><br>All clear! Gordon Comstock, poet ('of exceptional promise', The<br>Times Lit. Supp. had said), hurriedly slipped into the W.C., flung<br>his tea-leaves down the waste-pipe, and pulled the plug. Then he<br>hurried back to his room, rebolted the door, and, with precautions<br>against noise, brewed himself a fresh pot of tea.<br><br>The room was passably warm by now. The tea and a cigarette worked<br>their short-lived magic. He began to feel a little less bored and<br>angry. Should he do a spot of work after all? He ought to work,<br>of course. He always hated himself afterwards when he had wasted a<br>whole evening. Half unwillingly, he shoved his chair up to the<br>table. It needed an effort even to disturb that frightful jungle<br>of papers. He pulled a few grimy sheets towards him, spread them<br>out, and looked at them. God, what a mess! Written on, scored<br>out, written over, scored out again, till they were like poor<br>old hacked cancer-patients after twenty operations. But the<br>handwriting, where it was not crossed out, was delicate and<br>'scholarly'. With pain and trouble Gordon had acquired that<br>'scholarly' hand, so different from the beastly copper-plate they<br>had taught him at school.<br><br>Perhaps he WOULD work; for a little while, anyway. He rummaged in<br>the litter of papers. Where was that passage he had been working<br>on yesterday? The poem was an immensely long one--that is, it was<br>going to be immensely long when it was finished--two thousand lines<br>or so, in rhyme royal, describing a day in London. London<br>Pleasures, its name was. It was a huge, ambitious project--the<br>kind of thing that should only be undertaken by people with endless<br>leisure. Gordon had not grasped that fact when he began the poem;<br>he grasped it now, however. How light-heartedly he had begun it,<br>two years ago! When he had chucked up everything and descended<br>into the slime of poverty, the conception of this poem had been at<br>least a part of his motive. He had felt so certain, then, that he<br>was equal to it. But somehow, almost from the start, London<br>Pleasures had gone wrong. It was too big for him, that was the<br>truth. It had never really progressed, it had simply fallen apart<br>into a series of fragments. And out of two years' work that was<br>all that he had to show--just fragments, incomplete in themselves<br>and impossible to join together. On every one of those sheets of<br>paper there was some hacked scrap of verse which had been written<br>and rewritten and rewritten over intervals of months. There were<br>not five hundred lines that you could say were definitely finished.<br>And he had lost the power to add to it any longer; he could only<br>tinker with this passage or that, groping now here, now there, in<br>its confusion. It was no longer a thing that he created, it was<br>merely a nightmare with which he struggled.<br><br>For the rest, in two whole years he had produced nothing except a<br>handful of short poems--perhaps a score in all. It was so rarely<br>that he could attain the peace of mind in which poetry, or prose<br>for that matter, has got to be written. The times when he 'could<br>not' work grew commoner and commoner. Of all types of human being,<br>only the artist takes it upon him to say that he 'cannot' work.<br>But it is quite true; there ARE times when one cannot work. Money<br>again, always money! Lack of money means discomfort, means squalid<br>worries, means shortage of tobacco, means ever-present consciousness<br>of failure--above all, it means loneliness. How can you be anything<br>but lonely on two quid a week? And in loneliness no decent book was<br>ever written. It was quite certain that London Pleasures would<br>never be the poem he had conceived--it was quite certain, indeed,<br>that it would never even be finished. And in the moments when he<br>faced facts Gordon himself was aware of this.<br><br>Yet all the same, and all the more for that very reason, he went on<br>with it. It was something to cling to. It was a way of hitting<br>back at his poverty and his loneliness. And after all, there were<br>times when the mood of creation returned, or seemed to return. It<br>returned tonight, for just a little while--just as long as it takes<br>to smoke two cigarettes. With smoke tickling his lungs, he<br>abstracted himself from the mean and actual world. He drove his<br>mind into the abyss where poetry is written. The gas-jet sang<br>soothing overhead. Words became vivid and momentous things. A<br>couplet, written a year ago and left as unfinished, caught his eye<br>with a note of doubt. He repeated it to himself, over and over.<br>It was wrong, somehow. It had seemed all right, a year ago; now,<br>on the other hand, it seemed subtly vulgar. He rummaged among the<br>sheets of foolscap till he found one that had nothing written on<br>the back, turned it over, wrote the couplet out anew, wrote a dozen<br>different versions of it, repeated each of them over and over to<br>himself. Finally there was none that satisfied him. The couplet<br>would have to go. It was cheap and vulgar. He found the original<br>sheet of paper and scored the couplet out with thick lines. And in<br>doing this there was a sense of achievement, of time not wasted, as<br>though the destruction of much labour were in some way an act of<br>creation.<br><br>Suddenly a double knock deep below made the whole house rattle.<br>Gordon started. His mind fled upwards from the abyss. The post!<br>London Pleasures was forgotten.<br><br>His heart fluttered. Perhaps Rosemary HAD written. Besides, there<br>were those two poems he had sent to the magazines. One of them,<br>indeed, he had almost given up as lost; he had sent it to an<br>American paper, the Californian Review, months ago. Probably they<br>wouldn't even bother to send it back. But the other was with an<br>English paper, the Primrose Quarterly. He had wild hopes of that<br>one. The Primrose Quarterly was one of those poisonous literary<br>papers in which the fashionable Nancy Boy and the professional<br>Roman Catholic walk bras dessus, bras dessous. It was also by a<br>long way the most influential literary paper in England. You were<br>a made man once you had had a poem in it. In his heart Gordon knew<br>that the Primrose Quarterly would never print his poems. He wasn't<br>up to their standard. Still, miracles sometimes happen; or, if not<br>miracles, accidents. After all, they'd had his poem six weeks.<br>Would they keep it six weeks if they didn't mean to accept it? He<br>tried to quell the insane hope. But at the worst there was a<br>chance that Rosemary had written. It was four whole days since she<br>had written. She wouldn't do it, perhaps, if she knew how it<br>disappointed him. Her letters--long, ill-spelt letters, full of<br>absurd jokes and protestations of love for him--meant far more to<br>him than she could ever understand. They were a reminder that<br>there was still somebody in the world who cared for him. They even<br>made up for the times when some beast had sent back one of his<br>poems; and, as a matter of fact, the magazines always did send back<br>his poems, except Antichrist, whose editor, Ravelston, was his<br>personal friend.<br><br>There was a shuffling below. It was always some minutes before Mrs<br>Wisbeach brought the letters upstairs. She liked to paw them<br>about, feel them to see how thick they were, read their postmarks,<br>hold them up to the light and speculate on their contents, before<br>yielding them to their rightful owners. She exercised a sort of<br>droit du seigneur over letters. Coming to her house, they were,<br>she felt, at least partially hers. If you had gone to the front<br>door and collected your own letters she would have resented it<br>bitterly. On the other hand, she also resented the labour of<br>carrying them upstairs. You would hear her footsteps very slowly<br>ascending, and then, if there was a letter for you, there would be<br>loud aggrieved breathing on the landing--this to let you know that<br>you had put Mrs Wisbeach out of breath by dragging her up all those<br>stairs. Finally, with a little impatient grunt, the letters would<br>be shoved under your door.<br><br>Mrs Wisbeach was coming up the stairs. Gordon listened. The<br>footsteps paused on the first floor. A letter for Flaxman. They<br>ascended, paused again on the second floor. A letter for the<br>engineer. Gordon's heart beat painfully. A letter, please God, a<br>letter! More footsteps. Ascending or descending? They were<br>coming nearer, surely! Ah, no, no! The sound grew fainter. She<br>was going down again. The footsteps died away. No letters.<br><br>He took up his pen again. It was a quite futile gesture. She<br>hadn't written after all! The little beast! He had not the<br>smallest intention of doing any more work. Indeed, he could not.<br>The disappointment had taken all the heart out of him. Only five<br>minutes ago his poem had still seemed to him a living thing; now he<br>knew it unmistakably for the worthless tripe that it was. With a<br>kind of nervous disgust he bundled the scattered sheets together,<br>stacked them in an untidy heap, and dumped them on the other side<br>of the table, under the aspidistra. He could not even bear to look<br>at them any longer.<br><br>He got up. It was too early to go to bed; at least, he was not in<br>the mood for it. He pined for a bit of amusement--something cheap<br>and easy. A seat in the pictures, cigarettes, beer. Useless! No<br>money to pay for any of them. He would read King Lear and forget<br>this filthy century. Finally, however, it was The Adventures of<br>Sherlock Holmes that he took from the mantelpiece. Sherlock Holmes<br>was his favourite of all books, because he knew it by heart. The<br>oil in the lamp was giving out and it was getting beastly cold.<br>Gordon dragged the quilt from his bed, wrapped it round his legs,<br>and sat down to read. His right elbow on the table, his hands<br>under his coat to keep them warm, he read through 'The Adventure of<br>the Speckled Band.' The little gas-mantle sighed above, the<br>circular flame of the oil lamp burned low, a thin bracket of fire,<br>giving out no more heat than a candle.<br><br>Down in Mrs Wisbeach's lair the clock struck half past ten. You<br>could always hear it striking at night. Ping-ping, ping-ping--a<br>note of doom! The ticking of the alarm clock on the mantelpiece<br>became audible to Gordon again, bringing with it the consciousness<br>of the sinister passage of time. He looked about him. Another<br>evening wasted. Hours, days, years slipping by. Night after<br>night, always the same. The lonely room, the womanless bed; dust,<br>cigarette ash, the aspidistra leaves. And he was thirty, nearly.<br>In sheer self-punishment he dragged forth a wad of London<br>Pleasures, spread out the grimy sheets, and looked at them as one<br>looks at a skull for a memento mori. London Pleasures, by Gordon<br>Comstock, author of Mice. His magnum opus. The fruit (fruit,<br>indeed!) of two years' work--that labyrinthine mess of words! And<br>tonight's achievement--two lines crossed out; two lines backward<br>instead of forward.<br><br>The lamp made a sound like a tiny hiccup and went out. With an<br>effort Gordon stood up and flung the quilt back on to his bed.<br>Better get to bed, perhaps, before it got any colder. He wandered<br>over towards the bed. But wait. Work tomorrow. Wind the clock,<br>set the alarm. Nothing accomplished, nothing done, has earned a<br>night's repose.<br><br>It was some time before he could find the energy to undress. For a<br>quarter of an hour, perhaps, he lay on the bed fully dressed, his<br>hands under his head. There was a crack on the ceiling that<br>resembled the map of Australia. Gordon contrived to work off his<br>shoes and socks without sitting up. He held up one foot and looked<br>at it. A smallish, delicate foot. Ineffectual, like his hands.<br>Also, it was very dirty. It was nearly ten days since he had a<br>bath. Becoming ashamed of the dirtiness of his feet, he sagged<br>into a sitting position and undressed himself, throwing his clothes<br>on to the floor. Then he turned out the gas and slid between the<br>sheets, shuddering, for he was naked. He always slept naked. His<br>last suit of pyjamas had gone west more than a year ago.<br><br>The clock downstairs struck eleven. As the first coldness of the<br>sheets wore off, Gordon's mind went back to the poem he had begun<br>that afternoon. He repeated in a whisper the single stanza that<br>was finished:<br><br><br>Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over<br>The bending poplars, newly bare,<br>And dark ribbons of the chimneys<br>Veer downward; flicked by whips of air,<br>Torn posters flutter.<br><br><br>The octosyllables flicked to and fro. Click-click, click-click!<br>The awful, mechanical emptiness of it appalled him. It was like<br>some futile little machine ticking over. Rhyme to rhyme, click-<br>click, click-click. Like the nodding of a clock-work doll.<br>Poetry! The last futility. He lay awake, aware of his own<br>futility, of his thirty years, of the blind alley into which he<br>had led his life.<br><br>The clock struck twelve. Gordon had stretched his legs out<br>straight. The bed had grown warm and comfortable. The upturned<br>beam of a car, somewhere in the street parallel to Willowbed Road,<br>penetrated the blind and threw into silhouette a leaf of the<br>aspidistra, shaped like Agamemnon's sword.<br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/1.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/3.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
