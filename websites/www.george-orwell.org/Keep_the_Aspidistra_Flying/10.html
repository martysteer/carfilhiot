<h2>Chapter 10</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Under ground, under ground! Down in the safe soft womb of earth,<br>where there is no getting of jobs or losing of jobs, no relatives<br>or friends to plague you, no hope, fear, ambition, honour, duty--<br>no DUNS of any kind. That was where he wished to be.<br><br>Yet it was not death, actual physical death, that he wished for.<br>It was a queer feeling that he had. It had been with him ever<br>since that morning when he had woken up in the police cell. The<br>evil, mutinous mood that comes after drunkenness seemed to have set<br>into a habit. That drunken night had marked a period in his life.<br>It had dragged him downward with strange suddenness. Before, he<br>had fought against the money-code, and yet he had clung to his<br>wretched remnant of decency. But now it was precisely from decency<br>that he wanted to escape. He wanted to go down, deep down, into<br>some world where decency no longer mattered; to cut the strings of<br>his self-respect, to submerge himself--to SINK, as Rosemary had<br>said. It was all bound up in his mind with the thought of being<br>UNDER GROUND. He liked to think about the lost people, the under-<br>ground people: tramps, beggars, criminals, prostitutes. It is a<br>good world that they inhabit, down there in their frowzy kips and<br>spikes. He liked to think that beneath the world of money there is<br>that great sluttish underworld where failure and success have no<br>meaning; a sort of kingdom of ghosts where all are equal. That was<br>where he wished to be, down in the ghost-kingdom, BELOW ambition.<br>It comforted him somehow to think of the smoke-dim slums of South<br>London sprawling on and on, a huge graceless wilderness where you<br>could lose yourself for ever.<br><br>And in a way this job was what he wanted; at any rate, it was<br>something near what he wanted. Down there in Lambeth, in winter,<br>in the murky streets where the sepia-shadowed faces of tea-<br>drunkards drifted through the mist, you had a SUBMERGED feeling.<br>Down here you had no contact with money or with culture. No<br>highbrow customers to whom you had to act the highbrow; no one who<br>was capable of asking you, in that prying way that prosperous<br>people have, 'What are you, with your brains and education, doing<br>in a job like this?' You were just part of the slum, and, like all<br>slum-dwellers, taken for granted. The youths and girls and<br>draggled middle-aged women who came to the library scarcely even<br>spotted the fact that Gordon was an educated man. He was just 'the<br>bloke at the library', and practically one of themselves.<br><br>The job itself, of course, was of inconceivable futility. You just<br>sat there, ten hours a day, six hours on Thursdays, handing out<br>books, registering them, and receiving twopences. Between whiles<br>there was nothing to do except read. There was nothing worth<br>watching in the desolate street outside. The principal event<br>of the day was when the hearse drove up to the undertaker's<br>establishment next door. This had a faint interest for Gordon,<br>because the dye was wearing off one of the horses and it was<br>assuming by degrees a curious purplish-brown shade. Much of the<br>time, when no customers came, he spent reading the yellow-jacketed<br>trash that the library contained. Books of that type you could<br>read at the rate of one an hour. And they were the kind of books<br>that suited him nowadays. It is real 'escape literature', that<br>stuff in the twopenny libraries. Nothing has ever been devised<br>that puts less strain on the intelligence; even a film, by<br>comparison, demands a certain effort. And so when a customer<br>demanded a book of this category or that, whether it was 'Sex' or<br>'Crime' or 'Wild West' or 'ROmance' (always with the accent on the<br>O). Gordon was ready with expert advice.<br><br>Mr Cheeseman was not a bad person to work for, so long as you<br>understood that if you worked till the Day of Judgement you would<br>never get a rise of wages. Needless to say, he suspected Gordon of<br>pinching the till-money. After a week or two he devised a new<br>system of booking, by which he could tell how many books had been<br>taken out and check this with the day's takings. But it was still<br>(he reflected) in Gordon's power to issue books and make no record<br>of them; and so the possibility that Gordon might be cheating him<br>of sixpence or even a shilling a day continued to trouble him, like<br>the pea under the princess's mattress. Yet he was not absolutely<br>unlikeable, in his sinister, dwarfish way. In the evenings, after<br>he had shut the shop, when he came along to the library to collect<br>the day's takings, he would stay talking to Gordon for a while and<br>recounting with nosy chuckles any particularly astute swindles that<br>he had worked lately. From these conversations Gordon pieced<br>together Mr Cheeseman's history. He had been brought up in the<br>old-clothes trade, which was his spiritual vocation, so to speak,<br>and had inherited the bookshop from an uncle three years ago. At<br>that time it was one of those dreadful bookshops in which there are<br>not even any shelves, in which the books lie about in monstrous<br>dusty piles with no attempt at classification. It was frequented<br>to some extent by book-collectors, because there was occasionally a<br>valuable book among the piles of rubbish, but mainly it kept going<br>by selling secondhand paper-covered thrillers at twopence each.<br>Over this dustheap Mr Cheeseman had presided, at first, with<br>intense disgust. He loathed books and had not yet grasped that<br>there was money to be made out of them. He was still keeping his<br>old-clothes shop going by means of a deputy, and intended to return<br>to it as soon as he could get a good offer for the bookshop. But<br>presently it was borne in upon him that books, properly handled,<br>are worth money. As soon as he had made this discovery he<br>developed as astonishing flair for bookdealing. Within two years<br>he had worked his shop up till it was one of the best 'rare'<br>bookshops of its size in London. To him a book was as purely an<br>article of merchandise as a pair of second-hand trousers. He had<br>never in his life READ a book himself, nor could he conceive why<br>anyone should want to do so. His attitude towards the collectors<br>who pored so lovingly over his rare editions was that of a sexually<br>cold prostitute towards her clientele. Yet he seemed to know by<br>the mere feel of a book whether it was valuable or not. His head<br>was a perfect mine of auction-records and first-edition dates, and<br>he had a marvellous nose for a bargain. His favourite way of<br>acquiring stock was to buy up the libraries of people who had just<br>died, especially clergymen. Whenever a clergyman died Mr Cheeseman<br>was on the spot with the promptness of a vulture. Clergymen, he<br>explained to Gordon, so often have good libraries and ignorant<br>widows. He lived over the shop, was unmarried, of course, and had<br>no amusements and seemingly no friends. Gordon used sometimes to<br>wonder what Mr Cheeseman did with himself in the evenings, when he<br>was not out snooping after bargains. He had a mental picture of Mr<br>Cheeseman sitting in a double-locked room with the shutters over<br>the windows, counting piles of half-crowns and bundles of pound<br>notes which he stowed carefully away in cigarette-tins.<br><br>Mr Cheeseman bullied Gordon and was on the look-out for an excuse<br>to dock his wages; yet he did not bear him any particular ill-will.<br>Sometimes in the evening when he came to the library he would<br>produce a greasy packet of Smith's Potato Crisps from his pocket,<br>and, holding it out, say in his clipped style:<br><br>'Hassome chips?'<br><br>The packet was always grasped so firmly in his large hand that it<br>was impossible to extract more than two or three chips. But he<br>meant it as a friendly gesture.<br><br>As for the place where Gordon lived, in Brewer's Yard, parallel to<br>Lambeth Cut on the south side, it was a filthy kip. His bed-<br>sitting room was eight shillings a week and was just under the<br>roof. With its sloping ceiling--it was a room shaped like a wedge<br>of cheese--and its skylight window, it was the nearest thing to the<br>proverbial poet's garret that he had ever lived in. There was a<br>large, low, broken-backed bed with a ragged patchwork quilt and<br>sheets that were changed once fortnightly; a deal table ringed by<br>dynasties of teapots; a rickety kitchen chair; a tin basin for<br>washing in; a gas-ring in the fender. The bare floorboards had<br>never been stained but were dark with dirt. In the cracks in the<br>pink wallpaper dwelt multitudes of bugs; however, this was winter<br>and they were torpid unless you over-warmed the room. You were<br>expected to make your own bed. Mrs Meakin, the landlady,<br>theoretically 'did out' the rooms daily, but four days out of five<br>she found the stairs too much for her. Nearly all the lodgers<br>cooked their own squalid meals in their bedrooms. There was no<br>gas-stove, of course; just the gas-ring in the fender, and, down<br>two flights of stairs, a large evil-smelling sink which was common<br>to the whole house.<br><br>In the garret adjoining Gordon's there lived a tall handsome old<br>woman who was not quite right in the head and whose face was often<br>as black as a Negro's from dirt. Gordon could never make out where<br>the dirt came from. It looked like coal dust. The children of the<br>neighbourhood used to shout 'Blackie!' after her as she stalked<br>along the pavement like a tragedy queen, talking to herself. On<br>the floor below there was a woman with a baby which cried, cried<br>everlastingly; also a young couple who used to have frightful<br>quarrels and frightful reconciliations which you could hear all<br>over the house. On the ground floor a house-painter, his wife, and<br>five children existed on the dole and an occasional odd job. Mrs<br>Meakin, the landlady, inhabited some burrow or other in the<br>basement. Gordon liked this house. It was all so different from<br>Mrs Wisbeach's. There was no mingy lower-middle-class decency<br>here, no feeling of being spied upon and disapproved of. So long<br>as you paid your rent you could do almost exactly as you liked;<br>come home drunk and crawl up the stairs, bring women in at all<br>hours, lie in bed all day if you wanted to. Mother Meakin was not<br>the type to interfere. She was a dishevelled, jelly-soft old<br>creature with a figure like a cottage loaf. People said that in<br>her youth she had been no better than she ought, and probably it<br>was true. She had a loving manner towards anything in trousers.<br>Yet it seemed that traces of respectability lingered in her breast.<br>On the day when Gordon installed himself he heard her puffing and<br>struggling up the stairs, evidently bearing some burden. She<br>knocked softly on the door with her knee, or the place where her<br>knee ought to have been, and he let her in.<br><br>''Ere y'are, then,' she wheezed kindly as she came in with her arms<br>full. 'I knew as 'ow you'd like this. I likes all my lodgers to<br>feel comfortable-like. Lemme put it on the table for you. There!<br>That makes the room like a bit more 'ome-like, don't it now?'<br><br>It was an aspidistra. It gave him a bit of a twinge to see it.<br>Even here, in this final refuge! Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?<br>But it was a poor weedy specimen--indeed, it was obviously dying.<br><br>In this place he could have been happy if only people would let him<br>alone. It was a place where you COULD be happy, in a sluttish way.<br>To spend your days in meaningless mechanical work, work that could<br>be slovened through in a sort of coma; to come home and light the<br>fire when you had any coal (there were sixpenny bags at the<br>grocer's) and get the stuffy little attic warm; to sit over a<br>squalid meal of bacon, bread-and-marg and tea, cooked over the gas-<br>ring; to lie on the frowzy bed, reading a thriller or doing the<br>Brain Brighteners in Tit Bits until the small hours; it was the<br>kind of life he wanted. All his habits had deteriorated rapidly.<br>He never shaved more than three times a week nowadays, and only<br>washed the parts that showed. There were good public baths near<br>by, but he hardly went to them as often as once in a month. He<br>never made his bed properly, but just turned back the sheets, and<br>never washed his few crocks till all of them had been used twice<br>over. There was a film of dust on everything. In the fender there<br>was always a greasy frying-pan and a couple of plates coated with<br>the remnants of fried eggs. One night the bugs came out of one of<br>the cracks and marched across the ceiling two by two. He lay on<br>his bed, his hands under his head, watching them with interest.<br>Without regret, almost intentionally, he was letting himself go to<br>pieces. At the bottom of all his feelings there was sulkiness a je<br>m'en fous in the face of the world. Life had beaten him; but you<br>can still beat life by turning your face away. Better to sink than<br>rise. Down, down into the ghost-kingdom, the shadowy world where<br>shame, effort, decency do not exist!<br><br>To sink! How easy it ought to be, since there are so few<br>competitors! But the strange thing is that often it is harder to<br>sink than to rise. There is always something that drags one<br>upwards. After all, one is never quite alone; there are always<br>friends, lovers, relatives. Everyone Gordon knew seemed to be<br>writing him letters, pitying him or bullying him. Aunt Angela had<br>written, Uncle Walter had written, Rosemary had written over and<br>over again, Ravelston had written, Julia had written. Even Flaxman<br>had sent a line to wish him luck. Flaxman's wife had forgiven him,<br>and he was back at Peckham, in aspidistral bliss. Gordon hated<br>getting letters nowadays. They were a link with that other world<br>from which he was trying to escape.<br><br>Even Ravelston had turned against him. That was after he had been<br>to see Gordon in his new lodgings. Until this visit he had not<br>realized what kind of neighbourhood Gordon was living in. As his<br>taxi drew up at the corner, in the Waterloo Road, a horde of ragged<br>shock-haired boys came swooping from nowhere, to fight round the<br>taxi door like fish at a bait. Three of them clung to the handle<br>and hauled the door open simultaneously. Their servile, dirty<br>little faces, wild with hope, made him feel sick. He flung some<br>pennies among them and fled up the alley without looking at them<br>again. The narrow pavements were smeared with a quantity of dogs'<br>excrement that was surprising, seeing that there were no dogs in<br>sight. Down in the basement Mother Meakin was boiling a haddock,<br>and you could smell it half-way up the stairs. In the attic<br>Ravelston sat on the rickety chair, with the ceiling sloping just<br>behind his head. The fire was out and there was no light in the<br>room except four candles guttering in a saucer beside the<br>aspidistra. Gordon lay on the ragged bed, fully dressed but with<br>no shoes on. He had scarcely stirred when Ravelston came in. He<br>just lay there, flat on his back, sometimes smiling a little, as<br>though there were some private joke between himself and the<br>ceiling. The room had already the stuffy sweetish smell of rooms<br>that have been lived in a long time and never cleaned. There were<br>dirty crocks lying about in the fender.<br><br>'Would you like a cup of tea?' Gordon said, without stirring.<br><br>'No thanks awfully--no,' said Ravelston, a little too hastily.<br><br>He had seen the brown-stained cups in the fender and the repulsive<br>common sink downstairs. Gordon knew quite well why Ravelston<br>refused the tea. The whole atmosphere of this place had given<br>Ravelston a kind of shock. That awful mixed smell of slops and<br>haddock on the stairs! He looked at Gordon, supine on the ragged<br>bed. And, dash it, Gordon was a gentleman! At another time he<br>would have repudiated that thought; but in this atmosphere pious<br>humbug was impossible. All the class-instincts which he believed<br>himself not to possess rose in revolt. It was dreadful to think of<br>anyone with brains and refinement living in a place like this. He<br>wanted to tell Gordon to get out of it, pull himself together, earn<br>a decent income, and live like a gentleman. But of course he didn't<br>say so. You can't say things like that. Gordon was aware of what<br>was going on inside Ravelston's head. It amused him, rather. He<br>felt no gratitude towards Ravelston for coming here and seeing him;<br>on the other hand, he was not ashamed of his surroundings as he<br>would once have been. There was a faint, amused malice in the way<br>he spoke.<br><br>'You think I'm a B.F., of course,' he remarked to the ceiling.<br><br>'No, I don't. Why should I?'<br><br>'Yes, you do. You think I'm a B.F. to stay in this filthy place<br>instead of getting a proper job. You think I ought to try for that<br>job at the New Albion.'<br><br>'No, dash it! I never thought that. I see your point absolutely.<br>I told you that before. I think you're perfectly right in<br>principle.'<br><br>'And you think principles are all right so long as one doesn't go<br>putting them into practice.'<br><br>'No. But the question always is, when IS one putting them into<br>practice?'<br><br>'It's quite simple. I've made war on money. This is where it's<br>led me.'<br><br>Ravelston rubbed his nose, then shifted uneasily on his chair.<br><br>'The mistake you make, don't you see, is in thinking one can live<br>in a corrupt society without being corrupt oneself. After all,<br>what do you achieve by refusing to make money? You're trying to<br>behave as though one could stand right outside our economic system.<br>But one can't. One's got to change the system, or one changes<br>nothing. One can't put things right in a hole-and-corner way, if<br>you take my meaning.'<br><br>Gordon waved a foot at the buggy ceiling.<br><br>'Of course this IS a hole-and-corner, I admit.'<br><br>'I didn't mean that,' said Ravelston, pained.<br><br>'But let's face facts. You think I ought to be looking about for a<br>GOOD job, don't you?'<br><br>'It depends on the job. I think you're quite right not to sell<br>yourself to that advertising agency. But it does seem rather a<br>pity that you should stay in that wretched job you're in at<br>present. After all, you HAVE got talents. You ought to be using<br>them somehow.'<br><br>'There are my poems,' said Gordon, smiling at his private joke.<br><br>Ravelston looked abashed. This remark silenced him. Of course,<br>there WERE Gordon's poems. There was London Pleasures, for<br>instance. Ravelston knew, and Gordon knew, and each knew that the<br>other knew, that London Pleasures would never be finished. Never<br>again, probably, would Gordon write a line of poetry; never, at<br>least, while he remained in this vile place, this blind-alley job<br>and this defeated mood. He had finished with all that. But this<br>could not be said, as yet. The pretence was still kept up that<br>Gordon was a struggling poet--the conventional poet-in-garret.<br><br>It was not long before Ravelston rose to go. This smelly place<br>oppressed him, and it was increasingly obvious that Gordon did not<br>want him here. He moved hesitantly towards the door, pulling on<br>his gloves, then came back again, pulling off his left glove and<br>flicking it against his leg.<br><br>'Look here, Gordon, you won't mind my saying it--this is a filthy<br>place, you know. This house, this street--everything.'<br><br>'I know. It's a pigsty. It suits me.'<br><br>'But do you HAVE to live in a place like this?'<br><br>'My dear chap, you know what my wages are. Thirty bob a week.'<br><br>'Yes, but--! Surely there ARE better places? What rent are you<br>paying?'<br><br>'Eight bob.'<br><br>'Eight bob? You could get a fairly decent unfurnished room for<br>that. Something a bit better than this, anyway. Look here, why<br>don't you take an unfurnished place and let me lend you ten quid<br>for furniture?'<br><br>'"Lend" me ten quid! After all you've "lent" me already? GIVE me<br>ten quid, you mean.'<br><br>Ravelston gazed unhappily at the wall. Dash it, what a thing to<br>say! He said flatly:<br><br>'All right, if you like to put it like that. GIVE you ten quid.'<br><br>'But as it happens, you see, I don't want it.'<br><br>'But dash it all! You might as well have a decent place to live<br>in.'<br><br>'But I don't want a decent place. I want an indecent place. This<br>one, for instance.'<br><br>'But why? Why?'<br><br>'It's suited to my station,' said Gordon, turning his face to the<br>wall.<br><br>A few days later Ravelston wrote him a long, diffident sort of<br>letter. It reiterated most of what he had said in their<br>conversation. Its general effect was that Ravelston saw Gordon's<br>point entirely, that there was a lot of truth in what Gordon said,<br>that Gordon was absolutely right in principle, but--! It was the<br>obvious, the inevitable 'but'. Gordon did not answer. It was<br>several months before he saw Ravelston again. Ravelston made<br>various attempts to get in touch with him. It was a curious fact--<br>rather a shameful fact from a Socialist's point of view--that the<br>thought of Gordon, who had brains and was of gentle birth, lurking<br>in that vile place and that almost menial job, worried him more<br>than the thought of ten thousand unemployed in Middlesbrough.<br>Several times, in hope of cheering Gordon up, he wrote asking him<br>to send contributions to Antichrist. Gordon never answered. The<br>friendship was at an end, it seemed to him. The evil time when he<br>had lived on Ravelston had spoiled everything. Charity kills<br>friendship.<br><br>And then there were Julia and Rosemary. They differed from<br>Ravelston in this, that they had no shyness about speaking their<br>minds. They did not say euphemistically that Gordon was 'right in<br>principle'; they knew that to refuse a 'good' job can never be<br>right. Over and over again they besought him to go back to the New<br>Albion. The worst was that he had both of them in pursuit of him<br>together. Before this business they had never met, but now<br>Rosemary had got to know Julia somehow. They were in feminine<br>league against him. They used to get together and talk about the<br>'maddening' way in which Gordon was behaving. It was the only<br>thing they had in common, their feminine rage against his<br>'maddening' behaviour. Simultaneously and one after the other, by<br>letter and by word of mouth, they harried him. It was unbearable.<br><br>Thank God, neither of them had seen his room at Mother Meakin's<br>yet. Rosemary might have endured it, but the sight of that filthy<br>attic would have been almost the death of Julia. They had been<br>round to see him at the library, Rosemary a number of times, Julia<br>once, when she could make a pretext to get away from the teashop.<br>Even that was bad enough. It dismayed them to see what a mean,<br>dreary little place the library was. The job at McKechnie's,<br>though wretchedly paid, had not been the kind of job that you need<br>actually be ashamed of. It brought Gordon into touch with<br>cultivated people; seeing that he was a 'writer' himself, it might<br>conceivably 'lead to something'. But here, in a street that was<br>almost a slum, serving out yellow-jacketed trash at thirty bob a<br>week--what hope was there in a job like that? It was just a<br>derelict's job, a blind-alley job. Evening after evening, walking<br>up and down the dreary misty street after the library was shut,<br>Gordon and Rosemary argued about it. She kept on and on at him.<br>WOULD he go back to the New Albion? WHY wouldn't he go back to the<br>New Albion? He always told her that the New Albion wouldn't take<br>him back. After all, he hadn't applied for the job and there was<br>no knowing whether he could get it; he preferred to keep it<br>uncertain. There was something about him now that dismayed and<br>frightened her. He seemed to have changed and deteriorated so<br>suddenly. She divined, though he did not speak to her about it,<br>that desire of his to escape from all effort and all decency, to<br>sink down, down into the ultimate mud. It was not only from money<br>but from life itself that he was turning away. They did not argue<br>now as they had argued in the old days before Gordon had lost his<br>job. In those days she had not paid much attention to his<br>preposterous theories. His tirades against the money-morality had<br>been a kind of joke between them. And it had hardly seemed to<br>matter that time was passing and that Gordon's chance of earning a<br>decent living was infinitely remote. She had still thought of<br>herself as a young girl and of the future as limitless. She had<br>watched him fling away two years of his life--two years of HER<br>life, for that matter; and she would have felt it ungenerous to<br>protest.<br><br>But now she was growing frightened. Time's winged chariot was<br>hurrying near. When Gordon lost his job she had suddenly realized,<br>with the sense of making a startling discovery, that after all she<br>was no longer very young. Gordon's thirtieth birthday was past;<br>her own was not far distant. And what lay ahead of them? Gordon<br>was sinking effortless into grey, deadly failure. He seemed to<br>WANT to sink. What hope was there that they could ever get married<br>now? Gordon knew that she was right. The situation was impossible.<br>And so the thought, unspoken as yet, grew gradually in both their<br>minds that they would have to part--for good.<br><br>One night they were to meet under the railway arches. It was a<br>horrible January night; no mist, for once, only a vile wind that<br>screeched round corners and flung dust and torn paper into your<br>face. He waited for her, a small slouching figure, shabby almost<br>to raggedness, his hair blown about by the wind. She was punctual,<br>as usual. She ran towards him, pulled his face down, and kissed<br>his cold cheek.<br><br>'Gordon, dear, how cold you are! Why did you come out without an<br>overcoat?'<br><br>'My overcoat's up the spout. I thought you knew.'<br><br>'Oh, dear! Yes.'<br><br>She looked up at him, a small frown between her black brows. He<br>looked so haggard, so despondent, there in the ill-lit archway, his<br>face full of shadows. She wound her arm through his and pulled him<br>out into the light.<br><br>'Let's keep walking. It's too cold to stand about. I've got<br>something serious I want to say to you.'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'I expect you'll be very angry with me.'<br><br>'What is it?'<br><br>'This afternoon I went and saw Mr Erskine. I asked leave to speak<br>to him for a few minutes.'<br><br>He knew what was coming. He tried to free his arm from hers, but<br>she held on to it.<br><br>'Well?' he said sulkily.<br><br>'I spoke to him about you. I asked him if he'd take you back. Of<br>course he said trade was bad and they couldn't afford to take on<br>new staff and all that. But I reminded him of what he'd said to<br>you, and he said, Yes, he'd always thought you were very promising.<br>And in the end he said he'd be quite ready to find a job for you if<br>you'd come back. So you see I WAS right. They WILL give you the<br>job.'<br><br>He did not answer. She squeezed his arm. 'So NOW what do you<br>think about it?' she said.<br><br>'You know what I think,' he said coldly.<br><br>Secretly he was alarmed and angry. This was what he had been<br>fearing. He had known all along that she would do it sooner or<br>later. It made the issue more definite and his own blame clearer.<br>He slouched on, his hands still in his coat pockets, letting her<br>cling to his arm but not looking towards her.<br><br>'You're angry with me?' she said.<br><br>'No, I'm not. But I don't see why you had to do it--behind my<br>back.'<br><br>That wounded her. She had had to plead very hard before she had<br>managed to extort that promise from Mr Erskine. And it had needed<br>all her courage to beard the managing director in his den. She had<br>been in deadly fear that she might be sacked for doing it. But she<br>wasn't going to tell Gordon anything of that.<br><br>'I don't think you ought to say BEHIND YOUR BACK. After all, I was<br>only trying to help you.'<br><br>'How does it help me to get the offer of a job I wouldn't touch<br>with a stick?'<br><br>'You mean you won't go back, even now?'<br><br>'Never.'<br><br>'Why?'<br><br>'MUST we go into it again?' he said wearily.<br><br>She squeezed his arm with all her strength and pulled him round,<br>making him face her. There was a kind of desperation in the way<br>she clung to him. She had made her last effort and it had failed.<br>It was as though she could feel him receding, fading away from her<br>like a ghost.<br><br>'You'll break my heart if you go on like this,' she said.<br><br>'I wish you wouldn't trouble about me. It would be so much simpler<br>if you didn't.'<br><br>'But why do you have to throw your life away?'<br><br>'I tell you I can't help it. I've got to stick to my guns.'<br><br>'You know what this will mean?'<br><br>With a chill at his heart, and yet with a feeling of resignation,<br>even of relief, he said: 'You mean we shall have to part--not see<br>each other again?'<br><br>They had walked on, and now they emerged into the Westminster<br>Bridge Road. The wind met them with a scream, whirling at them a<br>cloud of dust that made both of them duck their heads. They halted<br>again. Her small face was full of lines, and the cold wind and the<br>cold lamplight did not improve it.<br><br>'You want to get rid of me,' he said.<br><br>'No. No. It's not exactly that.'<br><br>'But you feel we ought to part.'<br><br>'How can we go on like this?' she said desolately.<br><br>'It's difficult, I admit.'<br><br>'It's all so miserable, so hopeless! What can it ever lead to?'<br><br>'So you don't love me after all?' he said.<br><br>'I do, I do! You know I do.'<br><br>'In a way, perhaps. But not enough to go on loving me when it's<br>certain I'll never have the money to keep you. You'll have me as a<br>husband, but not as a lover. It's still a question of money, you<br>see.'<br><br>'It is NOT money, Gordon! It's NOT that.'<br><br>'Yes, it's just money. There's been money between us from the<br>start. Money, always money!'<br><br>The scene continued, but not for very much longer. Both of them<br>were shivering with cold. There is no emotion that matters greatly<br>when one is standing at a street corner in a biting wind. When<br>finally they parted it was with no irrevocable farewell. She<br>simply said, 'I must get back,' kissed him, and ran across the road<br>to the tram-stop. Mainly with relief he watched her go. He could<br>not stop now to ask himself whether he loved her. Simply he wanted<br>to get away--away from the windy street, away from scenes and<br>emotional demands, back in the frowzy solitude of his attic. If<br>there were tears in his eyes it was only from the cold of the wind.<br><br>With Julia it was almost worse. She asked him to go and see her<br>one evening. This was after she had heard, from Rosemary, of Mr<br>Erksine's offer of a job. The dreadful thing with Julia was that<br>she understood nothing, absolutely nothing, of his motives. All<br>she understood was that a 'good' job had been offered him and that<br>he had refused it. She implored him almost on her knees not to<br>throw this chance away. And when he told her that his mind was<br>made up, she wept, actually wept. That was dreadful. The poor<br>goose-like girl, with streaks of grey in her hair, weeping without<br>grace or dignity in her little Drage-furnished bed-sitting room!<br>This was the death of all her hopes. She had watched the family<br>go down and down, moneyless and childless, into grey obscurity.<br>Gordon alone had had it in him to succeed; and he, from mad<br>perverseness, would not. He knew what she was thinking; he had to<br>induce in himself a kind of brutality to stand firm. It was only<br>because of Rosemary and Julia that he cared. Ravelston did not<br>matter, because Ravelston understood. Aunt Angela and Uncle<br>Walter, of course, were bleating weakly at him in long, fatuous<br>letters. But them he disregarded.<br><br>In desperation Julia asked him, what did he mean to DO now that he<br>had flung away his last chance of succeeding in life. He answered<br>simply, 'My poems.' He had said the same to Rosemary and to<br>Ravelston. With Ravelston the answer had sufficed. Rosemary had<br>no longer any belief in his poems, but she would not say so. As<br>for Julia, his poems had never at any time meant anything to her.<br>'I don't see much sense in writing if you can't make money out of<br>it,' was what she had always said. And he himself did not believe<br>in his poems any longer. But he still struggled to 'write', at<br>least at times. Soon after he changed his lodgings he had copied<br>out on to clean sheets the completed portions of London Pleasures--<br>not quite four hundred lines, he discovered. Even the labour of<br>copying it out was a deadly bore. Yet he still worked on it<br>occasionally; cutting out a line here, altering another there, not<br>making or even expecting to make any progress. Before long the<br>pages were as they had been before, a scrawled, grimy labyrinth of<br>words. He used to carry the wad of grimy manuscript about with him<br>in his pocket. The feeling of it there upheld him a little; after<br>all it was a kind of achievement, demonstrable to himself though to<br>nobody else. There it was, sole product of two years--of a<br>thousand hours' work, it might be. He had no feeling for it any<br>longer as a poem. The whole concept of poetry was meaningless to<br>him now. It was only that if London Pleasures were ever finished<br>it would be something snatched from fate, a thing created OUTSIDE<br>the money-world. But he knew, far more clearly than before, that<br>it never would be finished. How was it possible that any creative<br>impulse should remain to him, in the life he was living now? As<br>time went on, even the desire to finish London Pleasures vanished.<br>He still carried the manuscript about in his pocket; but it was<br>only a gesture, a symbol of his private war. He had finished for<br>ever with that futile dream of being a 'writer'. After all, was<br>not that too a species of ambition? He wanted to get away from all<br>that, BELOW all that. Down, down! Into the ghost-kingdom, out of<br>the reach of hope, out of the reach of fear! Under ground, under<br>ground! That was where he wished to be.<br><br>Yet in a way it was not so easy. One night about nine he was lying<br>on his bed, with the ragged counterpane over his feet, his hands<br>under his head to keep them warm. The fire was out. The dust was<br>thick on everything. The aspidistra had died a week ago and was<br>withering upright in its pot. He slid a shoeless foot from under<br>the counterpane, held it up, and looked at it. His sock was full<br>of holes--there were more holes than sock. So here he lay, Gordon<br>Comstock, in a slum attic on a ragged bed, with his feet sticking<br>out of his socks, with one and fourpence in the world, with three<br>decades behind him and nothing, nothing accomplished! Surely NOW<br>he was past redemption? Surely, try as they would, they couldn't<br>prise him out of a hole like this? He had wanted to reach the mud--<br>well, this was the mud, wasn't it?<br><br>Yet he knew that it was not so. That other world, the world of<br>money and success, is always so strangely near. You don't escape<br>it merely by taking refuge in dirt and misery. He had been<br>frightened as well as angry when Rosemary told him about Mr<br>Erskine's offer. It brought the danger so close to him. A letter,<br>a telephone message, and from this squalor he could step straight<br>back into the money-world--back to four quid a week, back to effort<br>and decency and slavery. Going to the devil isn't so easy as it<br>sounds. Sometimes your salvation hunts you down like the Hound of<br>Heaven.<br><br>For a while he lay in an almost mindless state, gazing at the<br>ceiling. The utter futility of just lying there, dirty and cold,<br>comforted him a little. But presently he was roused by a light tap<br>at the door. He did not stir. It was Mother Meakin, presumably,<br>though it did not sound like her knock.<br><br>'Come in,' he said.<br><br>The door opened. It was Rosemary.<br><br>She stepped in, and then stopped as the dusty sweetish smell of the<br>room caught her. Even in the bad light of the lamp she could see<br>the state of filth the room was in--the litter of food and papers<br>on the table, the grate full of cold ashes, the foul crocks in the<br>fender, the dead aspidistra. As she came slowly towards the bed<br>she pulled her hat off and threw it on to the chair.<br><br>'WHAT a place for you to live in!' she said.<br><br>'So you've come back?' he said.<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>He turned a little away from her, his arm over his face. 'Come<br>back to lecture me some more, I suppose?'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'Then why?'<br><br>'Because--'<br><br>She had knelt down beside the bed. She pulled his arm away, put<br>her face forward to kiss him, then drew back, surprised, and began<br>to stroke the hair over his temple with the tips of her fingers.<br><br>'Oh, Gordon!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'You've got grey in your hair!'<br><br>'Have I? Where?'<br><br>'Here--over the temple. There's quite a little patch of it. It<br>must have happened all of a sudden.'<br><br>'"My golden locks time hath to silver turned,"' he said<br>indifferently.<br><br>'So we're both going grey,' she said.<br><br>She bent her head to show him the three white hairs on her crown.<br>Then she wriggled herself on to the bed beside him, put an arm<br>under him, pulled him towards her, covered his face with kisses.<br>He let her do it. He did not want this to happen--it was the very<br>thing that he least wanted. But she had wriggled herself beneath<br>him; they were breast to breast. Her body seemed to melt into his.<br>By the expression of her face he knew what had brought her here.<br>After all, she was virgin. She did not know what she was doing.<br>It was magnanimity, pure magnanimity, that moved her. His<br>wretchedness had drawn her back to him. Simply because he was<br>penniless and a failure she had got to yield to him, even if it was<br>only once.<br><br>'I had to come back,' she said.<br><br>'Why?'<br><br>'I couldn't bear to think of you here alone. It seemed so awful,<br>leaving you like that.'<br><br>'You did quite right to leave me. You'd much better not have come<br>back. You know we can't ever get married.'<br><br>'I don't care. That isn't how one behaves to people one loves. I<br>don't care whether you marry me or not. I love you.'<br><br>'This isn't wise,' he said.<br><br>'I don't care. I wish I'd done it years ago.'<br><br>'We'd much better not.'<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'Yes!'<br><br>After all, she was too much for him. He had wanted her so long,<br>and he could not stop to weigh the consequences. So it was done<br>at last, without much pleasure, on Mother Meakin's dingy bed.<br>Presently Rosemary got up and rearranged her clothes. The room,<br>though stuffy, was dreadfully cold. They were both shivering a<br>little. She pulled the coverlet further over Gordon. He lay<br>without stirring, his back turned to her, his face hidden against<br>his arm. She knelt down beside the bed, took his other hand, and<br>laid it for a moment against her cheek. He scarcely noticed her.<br>Then she shut the door quietly behind her and tiptoed down the<br>bare, evil-smelling stairs. She felt dismayed, disappointed, and<br>very cold. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/9.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/11.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
