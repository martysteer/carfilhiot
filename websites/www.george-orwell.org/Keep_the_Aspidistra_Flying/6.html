<h2>Chapter 6</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">This woman business! What a bore it is! What a pity we can't cut<br>it right out, or at least be like the animals--minutes of ferocious<br>lust and months of icy chastity. Take a cock pheasant, for<br>example. He jumps up on the hens' backs without so much as a with<br>your leave or by your leave. And no sooner it is over than the<br>whole subject is out of his mind. He hardly even notices his hens<br>any longer; he ignores them, or simply pecks them if they come too<br>near his food. He is not called upon to support his offspring,<br>either. Lucky pheasant! How different from the lord of creation,<br>always on the hop between his memory and his conscience!<br><br>Tonight Gordon wasn't even pretending to do any work. He had gone<br>out again immediately after supper. He walked southward, rather<br>slowly, thinking about women. It was a mild, misty night, more<br>like autumn than winter. This was Tuesday and he had four and<br>fourpence left. He could go down to the Crichton if he chose.<br>Doubtless Flaxman and his pals were already boozing there. But the<br>Crichton, which had seemed like paradise when he had no money,<br>bored and disgusted him when it was in his power to go there. He<br>hated the stale, beery place, and the sights, sounds, smells, all<br>so blatantly and offensively male. There were no women there; only<br>the barmaid with her lewd smile which seemed to promise everything<br>and promised nothing.<br><br>Women, women! The mist that hung motionless in the air turned the<br>passers-by into ghosts at twenty yards' distance; but in the little<br>pools of light about the lamp-posts there were glimpses of girls'<br>faces. He thought of Rosemary, of women in general, and of<br>Rosemary again. All afternoon he had been thinking of her. It was<br>with a kind of resentment that he thought of her small, strong<br>body, which he had never yet seen naked. How damned unfair it is<br>that we are filled to the brim with these tormenting desires and<br>then forbidden to satisfy them! Why should one, merely because<br>one has no money, be deprived of THAT? It seems so natural, so<br>necessary, so much a part of the inalienable rights of a human<br>being. As he walked down the dark street, through the cold yet<br>languorous air, there was a strangely hopeful feeling in his<br>breast. He half believed that somewhere ahead in the darkness a<br>woman's body was waiting for him. But also he knew that no woman<br>was waiting, not even Rosemary. It was eight days now since she<br>had even written to him. The little beast! Eight whole days<br>without writing! When she knew how much her letters meant to him!<br>How manifest it was that she didn't care for him any longer, that<br>he was merely a nuisance to her with his poverty and his shabbiness<br>and his everlasting pestering of her to say she loved him! Very<br>likely she would never write again. She was sick of him--sick of<br>him because he had no money. What else could you expect? He had<br>no hold over her. No money, therefore no hold. In the last<br>resort, what holds a woman to any man, except money?<br><br>A girl came down the pavement alone. He passed her in the light of<br>the lamp-post. A working-class girl, eighteen years old it might<br>be, hatless, with wildrose face. She turned her head quickly when<br>she saw him looking at her. She dreaded to meet his eyes. Beneath<br>the thin silky raincoat she was wearing, belted at the waist, her<br>youthful flanks showed supple and trim. He could have turned and<br>followed her, almost. But what was the use? She'd run away or<br>call a policeman. My golden locks time hath to silver turned, he<br>thought. He was thirty and moth-eaten. What woman worth having<br>would ever look at him again?<br><br>This woman business! Perhaps you'd feel differently about it if<br>you were married? But he had taken an oath against marriage long<br>ago. Marriage is only a trap set for you by the money-god. You<br>grab the bait; snap goes the trap; and there you are, chained by<br>the leg to some 'good' job till they cart you to Kensal Green.<br>And what a life! Licit sexual intercourse in the shade of the<br>aspidistra. Pram-pushing and sneaky adulteries. And the wife<br>finding you out and breaking the cut-glass whisky decanter over<br>your head.<br><br>Nevertheless he perceived that in a way it is necessary to marry.<br>If marriage is bad, the alternative is worse. For a moment he<br>wished that he were married; he pined for the difficulty of it, the<br>reality, the pain. And marriage must be indissoluble, for better<br>for worse, for richer for poorer, till death do you part. The old<br>Christian ideal--marriage tempered by adultery. Commit adultery if<br>you must, but at any rate have the decency to CALL it adultery.<br>None of that American soul-mate slop. Have your fun and then sneak<br>home, juice of the forbidden fruit dripping from your whiskers, and<br>take the consequences. Cut-glass whisky decanters broken over your<br>head, nagging, burnt meals, children crying, clash and thunder of<br>embattled mothers-in-law. Better that, perhaps, than horrible<br>freedom? You'd know, at least, that it was real life that you were<br>living.<br><br>But anyway, how can you marry on two quid a week? Money, money,<br>always money! The devil of it is, that outside marriage, no decent<br>relationship with a woman is possible. His mind moved backwards,<br>over his ten years of adult life. The faces of women flowed<br>through his memory. Ten or a dozen of them there had been. Tarts,<br>also. Comme au long d'un cadavre un cadavre etendu. And even when<br>they were not tarts it had been squalid, always squalid. Always it<br>had started in a sort of cold-blooded wilfulness and ended in some<br>mean, callous desertion. That, too, was money. Without money, you<br>can't be straightforward in your dealings with women. For without<br>money, you can't pick and choose, you've got to take what women you<br>can get; and then, necessarily, you've got to break free of them.<br>Constancy, like all other virtues, has got to be paid for in money.<br>And the mere fact that he had rebelled against the money code and<br>wouldn't settle down in the prison of a 'good' job--a thing no<br>woman will ever understand--had brought a quality of impermanence,<br>of deception, into all his affairs with women. Abjuring money, he<br>ought to have abjured women to. Serve the money-god, or do without<br>women--those are the only alternatives. And both were equally<br>impossible.<br><br>From the side-street just ahead, a shade of white light cut through<br>the mist, and there was a bellowing of street hawkers. It was<br>Luton Road, where they have the open-air market two evenings a<br>week. Gordon turned to his left, into the market. He often came<br>this way. The street was so crowded that you could only with<br>difficulty thread your way down the cabbage-littered alley between<br>the stalls. In the glare of hanging electric bulbs, the stuff on<br>the stalls glowed with fine lurid colours--hacked, crimson chunks<br>of meat, piles of oranges and green and white broccoli, stiff,<br>glassy-eyed rabbits, live eels looping in enamel troughs, plucked<br>fowls hanging in rows, sticking out their naked breasts like<br>guardsmen naked on parade. Gordon's spirits revived a little. He<br>liked the noise, the bustle, the vitality. Whenever you see a<br>street-market you know there's hope for England yet. But even here<br>he felt his solitude. Girls were thronging everywhere, in knots of<br>four or five, prowling desirously about the stalls of cheap<br>underwear and swapping backchat and screams of laughter with the<br>youths who followed them. None had eyes for Gordon. He walked<br>among them as though invisible, save that their bodies avoided him<br>when he passed them. Ah, look there! Involuntarily he paused.<br>Over a pile of art-silk undies on a stall, three girls were<br>bending, intent, their faces close together--three youthful faces,<br>flower-like in the harsh light, clustering side by side like a<br>truss of blossom on a Sweet William or phlox. His heart stirred.<br>No eyes for him, of course! One girl looked up. Ah! Hurriedly,<br>with an offended air, she looked away again. A delicate flush like<br>a wash of aquarelle flooded her face. The hard, sexual stare in<br>his eyes had frightened her. They flee from me that sometime did<br>me seek! He walked on. If only Rosemary were here! He forgave<br>her now for not writing to him. He could forgive her anything, if<br>only she were here. He knew how much she meant to him, because she<br>alone of all women was willing to save him from the humiliation of<br>his loneliness.<br><br>At this moment he looked up, and saw something that made his heart<br>jump. He changed the focus of his eyes abruptly. For a moment he<br>thought he was imagining it. But no! It WAS Rosemary!<br><br>She was coming down the alley between the stalls, twenty or thirty<br>yards away. It was as though his desire had called her into being.<br>She had not seen him yet. She came towards him, a small debonair<br>figure, picking her way nimbly through the crowd and the muck<br>underfoot, her face scarcely visible because of a flat black hat<br>which she wore cocked down over her eyes like a Harrow boy's straw<br>hat. He started towards her and called her name.<br><br>'Rosemary! Hi, Rosemary!'<br><br>A blue-aproned man thumbing codfish on a stall turned to stare at<br>him. Rosemary did not hear him because of the din. He called<br>again.<br><br>'Rosemary! I say, Rosemary!'<br><br>They were only a few yards apart now. She started and looked up.<br><br>'Gordon! What are you doing here?'<br><br>'What are YOU doing here?'<br><br>'I was coming to see you.'<br><br>'But how did you know I was here?'<br><br>'I didn't. I always come this way. I get out of the tube at<br>Camden Town.'<br><br>Rosemary sometimes came to see Gordon at Willowbed Road. Mrs<br>Wisbeach would inform him sourly that 'there was a young woman to<br>see him', and he would come downstairs and they would go out for a<br>walk in the streets. Rosemary was never allowed indoors, not even<br>into the hall. That was a rule of the house. You would have<br>thought 'young women' were plague-rats by the way Mrs Wisbeach<br>spoke of them. Gordon took Rosemary by the upper arm and made to<br>pull her against him.<br><br>'Rosemary! Oh, what a joy to see you again! I was so vilely<br>lonely. Why didn't you come before?'<br><br>She shook off his hand and stepped back out of his reach. Under<br>her slanting hat-brim she gave him a glance that was intended to be<br>angry.<br><br>'Let me go, now! I'm very angry with you. I very nearly didn't<br>come after that beastly letter you sent me.'<br><br>'What beastly letter?'<br><br>'You know very well.'<br><br>'No, I don't. Oh, well, let's get out of this. Somewhere where we<br>can talk. This way.'<br><br>He took her arm, but she shook him off again, continuing however,<br>to walk at his side. Her steps were quicker and shorter than his.<br>And walking beside him she had the appearance of something<br>extremely small, nimble, and young, as though he had had some<br>lively little animal, a squirrel for instance, frisking at his<br>side. In reality she was not very much smaller than Gordon, and<br>only a few months younger. But no one would ever have described<br>Rosemary as a spinster of nearly thirty, which in fact she was.<br>She was a strong, agile girl, with stiff black hair, a small<br>triangular face, and very pronounced eyebrows. It was one of those<br>small, peaky faces, full of character, which one sees in sixteenth-<br>century portraits. The first time you saw her take her hat off you<br>got a surprise, for on her crown three white hairs glittered among<br>the black ones like silver wires. It was typical of Rosemary that<br>she never bothered to pull the white hairs out. She still thought<br>of herself as a very young girl, and so did everybody else. Yet if<br>you looked closely the marks of time were plain enough on her face.<br><br>Gordon walked more boldly with Rosemary at his side. He was proud<br>of her. People were looking at her, and therefore at him as well.<br>He was no longer invisible to women. As always, Rosemary was<br>rather nicely dressed. It was a mystery how she did it on four<br>pounds a week. He liked particularly the hat she was wearing--one<br>of those flat felt hats which were then coming into fashion and<br>which caricatured a clergyman's shovel hat. There was something<br>essentially frivolous about it. In some way difficult to be<br>described, the angle at which it was cocked forward harmonized<br>appealingly with the curve of Rosemary's behind.<br><br>'I like your hat,' he said.<br><br>In spite of herself, a small smile flickered at the corner of her<br>mouth.<br><br>'It IS rather nice,' she said, giving the hat a little pat with her<br>hand.<br><br>She was still pretending to be angry, however. She took care that<br>their bodies should not touch. As soon as they had reached the end<br>of the stalls and were in the main street she stopped and faced him<br>sombrely.<br><br>'What do you mean by writing me letters like that?' she said.<br><br>'Letters like what?'<br><br>'Saying I'd broken your heart.'<br><br>'So you have.'<br><br>'It looks like it, doesn't it!'<br><br>'I don't know. It certainly feels like it.'<br><br>The words were spoken half jokingly, and yet they made her look<br>more closely at him--at his pale, wasted face, his uncut hair, his<br>general down-at-heel, neglected appearance. Her heart softened<br>instantly, and yet she frowned. Why WON'T he take care of himself?<br>was the thought in her mind. They had moved closer together. He<br>took her by the shoulders. She let him do it, and, putting her<br>small arms round him, squeezed him very hard, partly in affection,<br>partly in exasperation.<br><br>'Gordon, you ARE a miserable creature!' she said.<br><br>'Why am I a miserable creature?'<br><br>'Why can't you look after yourself properly? You're a perfect<br>scarecrow. Look at these awful old clothes you're wearing!'<br><br>'They're suited to my station. One can't dress decently on two<br>quid a week, you know.'<br><br>'But surely there's no need to go about looking like a rag-bag?<br>Look at this button on your coat, broken in half!'<br><br>She fingered the broken button, then suddenly lifted his<br>discoloured Woolworth's tie aside. In some feminine way she had<br>divined that he had no buttons on his shirt.<br><br>'Yes, AGAIN! Not a single button. You are awful, Gordon!'<br><br>'I tell you I can't be bothered with things like that. I've got a<br>soul above buttons.'<br><br>'But why not give them to ME and let me sew them on for you? And,<br>oh, Gordon! You haven't even shaved today. How absolutely beastly<br>of you. You might at least take the trouble to shave every<br>morning.'<br><br>'I can't afford to shave every morning,' he said perversely.<br><br>'What DO you mean, Gordon? It doesn't cost money to shave, does<br>it?'<br><br>'Yes, it does. Everything costs money. Cleanness, decency,<br>energy, self-respect--everything. It's all money. Haven't I told<br>you that a million times?'<br><br>She squeezed his ribs again--she was surprisingly strong--and<br>frowned up at him, studying his face as a mother looks at some<br>peevish child of which she is unreasonably fond.<br><br>'WHAT a fool I am!' she said.<br><br>'In what way a fool?'<br><br>'Because I'm so fond of you.'<br><br>'Are you fond of me?'<br><br>'Of course I am. You know I am. I adore you. It's idiotic of<br>me.'<br><br>'Then come somewhere where it's dark. I want to kiss you.'<br><br>'Fancy being kissed by a man who hasn't even shaved!'<br><br>'Well, that'll be a new experience for you.'<br><br>'No, it won't, Gordon. Not after knowing YOU for two years.'<br><br>'Oh, well, come on, anyway.'<br><br>They found an almost dark alley between the backs of houses. All<br>their lovemaking was done in such places. The only place where<br>they could ever be private was the streets. He pressed her<br>shoulders against the rough damp bricks of the wall. She turned<br>her face readily up to his and clung to him with a sort of eager<br>violent affection, like a child. And yet all the while, though<br>they were body to body, it was as though there were a shield<br>between them. She kissed him as a child might have done, because<br>she knew that he expected to be kissed. It was always like this.<br>Only at very rare moments could he awake in her the beginnings of<br>physical desire; and these she seemed afterwards to forget, so that<br>he always had to begin at the beginning over again. There was<br>something defensive in the feeling of her small, shapely body. She<br>longed to know the meaning of physical love, but also she dreaded<br>it. It would destroy her youth, the youthful, sexless world in<br>which she chose to live.<br><br>He parted his mouth from hers in order to speak to her.<br><br>'Do you love me?' he said.<br><br>'Of course, silly. Why do you always ask me that?'<br><br>'I like to hear you say it. Somehow I never feel sure of you till<br>I've heard you say it.'<br><br>'But why?'<br><br>'Oh, well, you might have changed your mind. After all, I'm not<br>exactly the answer to a maiden's prayer. I'm thirty, and moth-<br>eaten at that.'<br><br>'Don't be so absurd, Gordon! Anyone would think you were a<br>hundred, to hear you talk. You know I'm the same age as you are.'<br><br>'Yes, but not moth-eaten.'<br><br>She rubbed her cheek against his, feeling the roughness of his day-<br>old beard. Their bellies were close together. He thought of the<br>two years he had wanted her and never had her. With his lips<br>almost against her ear he murmured:<br><br>'Are you EVER going to sleep with me?'<br><br>'Yes, some day I will. Not now. Some day.'<br><br>'It's always "some day". It's been "some day" for two years now.'<br><br>'I know. But I can't help it.'<br><br>He pressed her back against the wall, pulled off the absurd flat<br>hat, and buried his face in her hair. It was tormenting to be so<br>close to her and all for nothing. He put a hand under her chin and<br>lifted her small face up to his, trying to distinguish her features<br>in the almost complete darkness.<br><br>'Say you will, Rosemary. There's a dear! Do!'<br><br>'You know I'm going to SOME time.'<br><br>'Yes, but not SOME time--now. I don't mean this moment, but soon.<br>When we get an opportunity. Say you will!'<br><br>'I can't. I can't promise.'<br><br>'Say "yes," Rosemary. PLEASE do!'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>Still stroking her invisible face, he quoted:<br><br><br>'Veuillez le dire donc selon<br>Que vous estes benigne et doulche,<br>Car ce doulx mot n'est pas si long<br>Qu'il vous face mal en la bouche.'<br><br><br>'What does that mean?'<br><br>He translated it.<br><br>'I can't, Gordon. I just can't.'<br><br>'Say "yes," Rosemary, there's a dear. Surely it's as easy to say<br>"yes" as "no"?'<br><br>'No, it isn't, it's easy enough for you. You're a man. It's<br>different for a woman.'<br><br>'Say "yes," Rosemary! "Yes"--it's such an easy word. Go on, now;<br>say it. "Yes!"'<br><br>'Anyone would think you were teaching a parrot to talk, Gordon.'<br><br>'Oh, damn! Don't make jokes about it.'<br><br>It was not much use arguing. Presently they came out into the<br>street and walked on, southward. Somehow, from Rosemary's swift,<br>neat movements, from her general air of a girl who knows how to<br>look after herself and who yet treats life mainly as a joke, you<br>could make a good guess at her upbringing and her mental background.<br>She was the youngest child of one of those huge hungry families<br>which still exist here and there in the middle classes. There had<br>been fourteen children all told--the father was a country solicitor.<br>Some of Rosemary's sisters were married, some of them were<br>schoolmistresses or running typing bureaux; the brothers were<br>farming in Canada, on tea-plantations in Ceylon, in obscure<br>regiments of the Indian Army. Like all women who have had an<br>eventful girlhood, Rosemary wanted to remain a girl. That was why,<br>sexually, she was so immature. She had kept late into life the<br>high-spirited sexless atmosphere of a big family. Also she had<br>absorbed into her very bones the code of fair play and live-and-<br>let-live. She was profoundly magnanimous, quite incapable of<br>spiritual bullying. From Gordon, whom she adored, she put up with<br>almost anything. It was the measure of her magnanimity that never<br>once, in the two years that she had known him, had she blamed him<br>for not attempting to earn a proper living.<br><br>Gordon was aware of all this. But at the moment he was thinking of<br>other things. In the pallid circles of light about the lamp-posts,<br>beside Rosemary's smaller, trimmer figure, he felt graceless,<br>shabby, and dirty. He wished very much that he had shaved that<br>morning. Furtively he put a hand into his pocket and felt his<br>money, half afraid--it was a recurrent fear with him--that he might<br>have dropped a coin. However, he could feel the milled edge of a<br>form, his principal coin at the moment. Four and fourpence left.<br>He couldn't possibly take her out to supper, he reflected. They'd<br>have to trail dismally up and down the streets, as usual, or at<br>best go to a Lyons for a coffee. Bloody! How can you have any fun<br>when you've got no money? He said broodingly:<br><br>'Of course it all comes back to money.'<br><br>This remark came out of the blue. She looked up at him in surprise.<br><br>'What do you mean, it all comes back to money?'<br><br>'I mean the way nothing ever goes right in my life. It's always<br>money, money, money that's at the bottom of everything. And<br>especially between me and you. That's why you don't really love<br>me. There's a sort of film of money between us. I can feel it<br>every time I kiss you.'<br><br>'Money! What HAS money got to do with it, Gordon?'<br><br>'Money's got to do with everything. If I had more money you'd love<br>me more.'<br><br>'Of course, I wouldn't! Why should I?'<br><br>'You couldn't help it. Don't you see that if I had more money I'd<br>be more worth loving? Look at me now! Look at my face, look at<br>these clothes I'm wearing, look at everything else about me. Do<br>you suppose I'd be like that if I had two thousand a year? If I<br>had more money I should be a different person.'<br><br>'If you were a different person I shouldn't love you.'<br><br>'That's nonsense, too. But look at it like this. If we were<br>married would you sleep with me?'<br><br>'What questions you do ask! Of course I would. Otherwise, where<br>would be the sense of being married?'<br><br>'Well then, suppose I was decently well off, WOULD you marry me?'<br><br>'What's the good of talking about it, Gordon? You know we can't<br>afford to marry.'<br><br>'Yes, but IF we could. Would you?'<br><br>'I don't know. Yes, I would, I dare say.'<br><br>'There you are, then! That's what I said--money!'<br><br>'No, Gordon, no! That's not fair! You're twisting my words<br>round.'<br><br>'No, I'm not. You've got this money-business at the bottom of your<br>heart. Every woman's got it. You wish I was in a GOOD job now,<br>don't you?'<br><br>'Not in the way you mean it. I'd like you to be earning more<br>money--yes.'<br><br>'And you think I ought to have stayed on at the New Albion, don't<br>you? You'd like me to go back there now and write slogans for<br>Q. T. Sauce and Truweet Breakfast Crisps. Wouldn't you?'<br><br>'No, I wouldn't. I NEVER said that.'<br><br>'You thought it, though. It's what any woman would think.'<br><br>He was being horribly unfair, and he knew it. The one thing<br>Rosemary had never said, the thing she was probably quite incapable<br>of saying, was that he ought to go back to the New Albion. But<br>for the moment he did not even want to be fair. His sexual<br>disappointment still pricked him. With a sort of melancholy triumph<br>he reflected that, after all, he was right. It was money that stood<br>between them. Money, money, all is money! He broke into a<br>half-serious tirade:<br><br>'Women! What nonsense they make of all our ideas! Because one<br>can't keep free of women, and every woman makes one pay the same<br>price. "Chuck away your decency and make more money"--that's what<br>women say. "Chuck away your decency, suck the blacking off the<br>boss's boots, and buy me a better fur coat than the woman next<br>door." Every man you can see has got some blasted woman hanging<br>round his neck like a mermaid, dragging him down and down--down to<br>some beastly little semi-detached villa in Putney, with hire-<br>purchase furniture and a portable radio and an aspidistra in the<br>window. It's women who make all progress impossible. Not that I<br>believe in progress,' he added rather unsatisfactorily.<br><br>'What absolute NONSENSE you do talk, Gordon! As though women were<br>to blame for everything!'<br><br>'They are to blame, finally. Because it's the women who really<br>believe in the money-code. The men obey it; they have to, but they<br>don't believe in it. It's the women who keep it going. The women<br>and their Putney villas and their fur coats and their babies and<br>their aspidistras.'<br><br>'It is NOT the women, Gordon! Women didn't invent money, did<br>they?'<br><br>'It doesn't matter who invented it, the point is that it's women<br>who worship it. A woman's got a sort of mystical feeling towards<br>money. Good and evil in a women's mind mean simply money and no<br>money. Look at you and me. You won't sleep with me, simply and<br>solely because I've got no money. Yes, that IS the reason. (He<br>squeezed her arm to silence her.) You admitted it only a minute<br>ago. And if I had a decent income you'd go to bed with me<br>tomorrow. It's not because you're mercenary. You don't want me<br>to PAY you for sleeping with me. It's not so crude as that. But<br>you've got that deep-down mystical feeling that somehow a man<br>without money isn't worthy of you. He's a weakling, a sort of<br>half-man--that's how you feel. Hercules, god of strength and god<br>of money--you'll find that in Lempriere. It's women who keep all<br>mythologies going. Women!'<br><br>'Women!' echoed Rosemary on a different note. 'I hate the way men<br>are always talking about WOMEN. "Women do this," and "WOMEN do<br>that"--as though all women were exactly the same!'<br><br>'Of course all women are the same! What does any woman want except<br>a safe income and two babies and a semi-detached villa in Putney<br>with an aspidistra in the window?'<br><br>'Oh, you and your aspidistras!'<br><br>'On the contrary, YOUR aspidistras. You're the sex that cultivates<br>them.'<br><br>She squeezed his arm and burst out laughing. She was really<br>extraordinarily good-natured. Besides, what he was saying was such<br>palpable nonsense that it did not even exasperate her. Gordon's<br>diatribes against women were in reality a kind of perverse joke;<br>indeed, the whole sex-war is at bottom only a joke. For the same<br>reason it is great fun to pose as a feminist or an anti-feminist<br>according to your sex. As they walked on they began a violent<br>argument upon the eternal and idiotic question of Man versus Woman.<br>The moves in this argument--for they had it as often as they met--<br>were always very much the same. Men are brutes and women are<br>soulless, and women have always been kept in subjection and they<br>jolly well ought to be kept in subjection, and look at Patient<br>Griselda and look at Lady Astor, and what about polygamy and Hindu<br>widows, and what about Mother Pankhurst's piping days when every<br>decent woman wore mousetraps on her garters and couldn't look at a<br>man without feeling her right hand itch for a castrating knife?<br>Gordon and Rosemary never grew tired of this kind of thing. Each<br>laughed with delight at the other's absurdities. There was a merry<br>war between them. Even as they disputed, arm in arm, they pressed<br>their bodies delightedly together. They were very happy. Indeed,<br>they adored one another. Each was to the other a standing joke and<br>an object infinitely precious. Presently a red and blue haze of<br>Neon lights appeared in the distance. They had reached the<br>beginning of the Tottenham Court Road. Gordon put his arm round<br>her waist and turned her to the right, down a darkish side-street.<br>They were so happy together that they had got to kiss. They stood<br>clasped together under the lamp-post, still laughing, two enemies<br>breast to breast. She rubbed her cheek against his.<br><br>'Gordon, you are such a dear old ass! I can't help loving you,<br>scrubby jaw and all.'<br><br>'Do you really?'<br><br>'Really and truly.'<br><br>Her arms still round him, she leaned a little backwards, pressing<br>her belly against his with a sort of innocent voluptuousness.<br><br>'Life IS worth living, isn't it, Gordon?'<br><br>'Sometimes.'<br><br>'If only we could meet a bit oftener! Sometimes I don't see you<br>for weeks.'<br><br>'I know. It's bloody. If you knew how I hate my evenings alone!'<br><br>'One never seems to have time for anything. I don't even leave<br>that beastly office till nearly seven. What do you do with<br>yourself on Sundays, Gordon?'<br><br>'Oh, God! Moon about and look miserable, like everyone else.'<br><br>'Why not let's go out for a walk in the country sometimes. Then we<br>would have all day together. Next Sunday, for instance?'<br><br>The words chilled him. They brought back the thought of money,<br>which he had succeeded in putting out of his mind for half an hour<br>past. A trip into the country would cost money, far more than he<br>could possibly afford. He said in a non-committal tone that<br>transferred the whole thing to the realm of abstraction:<br><br>'Of course, it's not too bad in Richmond Park on Sundays. Or even<br>Hampstead Heath. Especially if you go in the mornings before the<br>crowds get there.'<br><br>'Oh, but do let's go right out into the country! Somewhere in<br>Surrey, for instance, or to Burnham Beeches. It's so lovely at<br>this time of year, with all the dead leaves on the ground, and you<br>can walk all day and hardly meet a soul. We'll walk for miles and<br>miles and have dinner at a pub. It would be such fun. Do let's!'<br><br>Blast! The money-business was coming back. A trip even as far as<br>Burnham Beeches would cost all of ten bob. He did some hurried<br>arithmetic. Five bob he might manage, and Julia would 'lend' him<br>five; GIVE him five, that was. At the same moment he remembered<br>his oath, constantly renewed and always broken, not to 'borrow'<br>money off Julia. He said in the same casual tone as before:<br><br>'It WOULD be rather fun. I should think we might manage it. I'll<br>let you know later in the week, anyway.'<br><br>They came out of the side-street, still arm in arm. There was a<br>pub on the corner. Rosemary stood on tiptoe, and, clinging to<br>Gordon's arm to support herself, managed to look over the frosted<br>lower half of the window.<br><br>'Look, Gordon, there's a clock in there. It's nearly half past<br>nine. Aren't you getting frightfully hungry?'<br><br>'No,' he said instantly and untruthfully.<br><br>'I am. I'm simply starving. Let's go and have something to eat<br>somewhere.' Money again! One moment more, and he must confess<br>that he had only four and fourpence in the world--four and<br>fourpence to last till Friday.<br><br>'I couldn't eat anything,' he said. 'I might manage a drink, I<br>dare say. Let's go and have some coffee or something. I expect<br>we'll find a Lyons open.'<br><br>'Oh, don't let's go to a Lyons! I know such a nice little Italian<br>restaurant, only just down the road. We'll have Spaghetti<br>Napolitaine and a bottle of red wine. I adore spaghetti. Do<br>let's!'<br><br>His heart sank. It was no good. He would have to own up. Supper<br>at the Italian Restaurant could not possibly cost less than five<br>bob for the two of them. He said almost sullenly:<br><br>'It's about time I was getting home, as a matter of fact.'<br><br>'Oh, Gordon! Already? Why?'<br><br>'Oh, well! If you MUST know, I've only got four and fourpence in<br>the world. And it's got to last till Friday.'<br><br>Rosemary stopped short. She was so angry that she pinched his arm<br>with all her strength, meaning to hurt him and punish him.<br><br>'Gordon, you ARE an ass! You're a perfect idiot! You're the most<br>unspeakable idiot I've ever seen!'<br><br>'Why am I an idiot?'<br><br>'Because what does it matter whether you've got any money! I'm<br>asking YOU to have supper with ME.'<br><br>He freed his arm from hers and stood away from her. He did not<br>want to look her in the face.<br><br>'What! Do you think I'd go to a restaurant and let you pay for my<br>food?'<br><br>'But why not?'<br><br>'Because one can't do that sort of thing. It isn't done.'<br><br>'It "isn't done"! You'll be saying it's "not cricket" in another<br>moment. WHAT "isn't done"?'<br><br>'Letting you pay for my meals. A man pays for a woman, a woman<br>doesn't pay for a man.'<br><br>'Oh, Gordon! Are we living in the reign of Queen Victoria?'<br><br>'Yes, we are, as far as that kind of thing's concerned. Ideas<br>don't change so quickly.'<br><br>'But MY ideas have changed.'<br><br>'No, they haven't. You think they have, but they haven't. You've<br>been brought up as a woman, and you can't help behaving like a<br>woman, however much you don't want to.'<br><br>'But what do you mean by BEHAVING LIKE A WOMAN, anyway?'<br><br>'I tell you every woman's the same when it comes to a thing like<br>this. A woman despises a man who's dependent on her and sponges on<br>her. She may say she doesn't, she may THINK she doesn't, but she<br>does. She can't help it. If I let you pay for my meals YOU'D<br>despise me.'<br><br>He had turned away. He knew how abominably he was behaving. But<br>somehow he had got to say these things. The feeling that people--<br>even Rosemary--MUST despise him for his poverty was too strong to<br>be overcome. Only by rigid, jealous independence could he keep his<br>self-respect. Rosemary was really distressed this time. She<br>caught his arm and pulled him round, making him face her. With an<br>insistent gesture, angrily and yet demanding to be loved, she<br>pressed her breast against him.<br><br>'Gordon! I won't let you say such things. How can you say I'd<br>ever despise you?'<br><br>'I tell you you couldn't help it if I let myself sponge on you.'<br><br>'Sponge on me! What expressions you do use! How is it sponging on<br>me to let me pay for your supper just for once!'<br><br>He could feel the small breasts, firm and round, just beneath his<br>own. She looked up at him, frowning and yet not far from tears.<br>She thought him perverse, unreasonable, cruel. But her physical<br>nearness distracted him. At this moment all he could remember was<br>that in two years she had never yielded to him. She had starved<br>him of the one thing that mattered. What was the good of pretending<br>that she loved him when in the last essential she recoiled? He<br>added with a kind of deadly joy:<br><br>'In a way you do despise me. Oh, yes, I know you're fond of me.<br>But after all, you can't take me quite seriously. I'm a kind of<br>joke to you. You're fond of me, and yet I'm not quite your equal--<br>that's how you feel.'<br><br>It was what he had said before, but with this difference, that now<br>he meant it, or said it as if he meant it. She cried out with<br>tears in her voice:<br><br>'I don't, Gordon, I don't! You KNOW I don't!'<br><br>'You do. That's why you won't sleep with me. Didn't I tell you<br>that before?'<br><br>She looked up at him an instant longer, and then buried her face in<br>his breast as suddenly as though ducking from a blow. It was<br>because she had burst into tears. She wept against his breast,<br>angry with him, hating him, and yet clinging to him like a child.<br>It was the childish way in which she clung to him, as a mere male<br>breast to weep on, that hurt him most. With a sort of self-hatred<br>he remembered the other women who in just the same way had cried<br>against his breast. It seemed the only thing he could do with<br>women, to make them cry. With his arm round her shoulders he<br>caressed her clumsily, trying to console her.<br><br>'You've gone and made me cry!' she whimpered in self-contempt.<br><br>'I'm sorry! Rosemary, dear one! Don't cry, PLEASE don't cry.'<br><br>'Gordon, dearest! WHY do you have to be so beastly to me?'<br><br>'I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Sometimes I can't help it.'<br><br>'But why? Why?'<br><br>She had got over her crying. Rather more composed, she drew away<br>from him and felt for something to wipe her eyes. Neither of them<br>had a handkerchief. Impatiently, she wrung the tears out of her<br>eyes with her knuckles.<br><br>'How silly we always are! Now, Gordon, BE nice for once. Come<br>along to the restaurant and have some supper and let me pay for<br>it.'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'Just this once. Never mind about the old money-business. Do it<br>just to please me.'<br><br>'I tell you I can't do that kind of thing. I've got to keep my end<br>up.'<br><br>'But what do you mean, keep your end up?'<br><br>'I've made a war on money, and I've got to keep the rules. The<br>first rule is never to take charity.'<br><br>'Charity! Oh, Gordon, I DO think you're silly!'<br><br>She squeezed his ribs again. It was a sign of peace. She did not<br>understand him, probably never would understand him; yet she<br>accepted him as he was, hardly even protesting against his<br>unreasonableness. As she put her face up to be kissed he noticed<br>that her lips were salt. A tear had trickled here. He strained<br>her against him. The hard defensive feeling had gone out of her<br>body. She shut her eyes and sank against him and into him as<br>though her bones had grown weak, and her lips parted and her small<br>tongue sought for his. It was very seldom that she did that. And<br>suddenly, as he felt her body yielding, he seemed to know with<br>certainty that their struggle was ended. She was his now when he<br>chose to take her, and yet perhaps she did not fully understand<br>what it was that she was offering; it was simply an instinctive<br>movement of generosity, a desire to reassure him--to smooth away<br>that hateful feeling of being unloveable and unloved. She said<br>nothing of this in words. It was the feeling of her body that<br>seemed to say it. But even if this had been the time and the place<br>he could not have taken her. At this moment he loved her but did<br>not desire her. His desire could only return at some future time<br>when there was no quarrel fresh in his mind and no consciousness of<br>four and fourpence in his pocket to daunt him.<br><br>Presently they separated their mouths, though still clinging<br>closely together.<br><br>'How stupid it is, the way we quarrel, isn't it Gordon? When we<br>meet so seldom.'<br><br>'I know. It's all my fault. I can't help it. Things rub me up.<br>It's money at the bottom of it, always money.'<br><br>'Oh, money! You let it worry you too much, Gordon.'<br><br>'Impossible. It's the only thing worth worrying about.'<br><br>'But, anyway, we WILL go out into the country next Sunday, won't<br>we? To Burnham Beeches or somewhere. It would be so nice if we<br>could.'<br><br>'Yes, I'd love to. We'll go early and be out all day. I'll raise<br>the train fares somehow.'<br><br>'But you'll let me pay my own fare, won't you?'<br><br>'No, I'd rather I paid them, but we'll go, anyway.'<br><br>'And you really won't let me pay for your supper--just this once,<br>just to show you trust me?'<br><br>'No, I can't. I'm sorry. I've told you why.'<br><br>'Oh, dear! I suppose we shall have to say good night. It's<br>getting late.'<br><br>They stayed talking a long time, however, so long that Rosemary got<br>no supper after all. She had to be back at her lodgings by eleven,<br>or the she-dragons were angry. Gordon went to the top of the<br>Tottenham Court Road and took the tram. It was a penny cheaper<br>than taking the bus. On the wooden seat upstairs he was wedged<br>against a small dirty Scotchman who read the football finals and<br>oozed beer. Gordon was very happy. Rosemary was going to be his<br>mistress. Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over. To the music of<br>the tram's booming he whispered the seven completed stanzas of his<br>poem. Nine stanzas there would be in all. It was GOOD. He<br>believed in it and in himself. He was a poet. Gordon Comstock,<br>author of Mice. Even in London Pleasures he once again believed.<br><br>He thought of Sunday. They were to meet at nine o'clock at<br>Paddington Station. Ten bob or so it would cost; he would raise<br>the money if he had to pawn his shirt. And she was going to become<br>his mistress; this very Sunday, perhaps, if the right chance<br>offered itself. Nothing had been said. Only, somehow, it was<br>agreed between them.<br><br>Please God it kept fine on Sunday! It was deep winter now. What<br>luck if it turned out one of those splendid windless days--one of<br>those days that might almost be summer, when you can lie for hours<br>on the dead bracken and never feel cold! But you don't get many<br>days like that; a dozen at most in every winter. As likely as not<br>it would rain. He wondered whether they would get a chance to do<br>it after all. They had nowhere to go, except the open air. There<br>are so many pairs of lovers in London with 'nowhere to go'; only<br>the streets and the parks, where there is no privacy and it is<br>always cold. It is not easy to make love in a cold climate when<br>you have no money. The 'never the time and the place' motif is not<br>made enough of in novels.<br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/5.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/7.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
