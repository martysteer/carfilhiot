<h2>Chapter 7</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The plumes of the chimneys floated perpendicular against skies of<br>smoky rose.<br><br>Gordon caught the 27 bus at ten past eight. The streets were still<br>locked in their Sunday sleep. On the doorsteps the milk bottles<br>waited ungathered like little white sentinels. Gordon had fourteen<br>shillings in his hand--thirteen and nine, rather, because the bus<br>fare was threepence. Nine bob he had set aside from his wages--God<br>knew what that was going to mean, later in the week!--and five he<br>had borrowed from Julia.<br><br>He had gone round to Julia's place on Thursday night. Julia's room<br>in Earl's Court, though only a second-floor back, was not just a<br>vulgar bedroom like Gordon's. It was a bed-sitting with the accent<br>on the sitting. Julia would have died of starvation sooner than<br>put up with such squalor as Gordon lived in. Indeed every one of<br>her scraps of furniture, collected over intervals of years,<br>represented a period of semi-starvation. There was a divan bed that<br>could very nearly be mistaken for a sofa, and a little round fumed<br>oak table, and two 'antique' hardwood chairs, and an ornamental<br>footstool and a chintz-covered armchair--Drage's: thirteen monthly<br>payments--in front of the tiny gas-fire; and there were various<br>brackets with framed photos of father and mother and Gordon and Aunt<br>Angela, and a birchwood calendar--somebody's Christmas present--with<br>'It's a long lane that has no turning' done on it in pokerwork.<br>Julia depressed Gordon horribly. He was always telling himself that<br>he ought to go and see her oftener; but in practice he never went<br>near her except to 'borrow' money.<br><br>When Gordon had given three knocks--three knocks for second floor--<br>Julia took him up to her room and knelt down in front of the gas-<br>fire.<br><br>'I'll light the fire again,' she said. 'You'd like a cup of tea,<br>wouldn't you?'<br><br>He noted the 'again'. The room was beastly cold--no fire had been<br>lighted in it this evening. Julia always 'saved gas' when she was<br>alone. He looked at her long narrow back as she knelt down. How<br>grey her hair was getting! Whole locks of it were quite grey. A<br>little more, and it would be 'grey hair' tout court.<br><br>'You like your tea strong, don't you?' breathed Julia, hovering<br>over the tea-caddy with tender, goose-like movements.<br><br>Gordon drank his cup of tea standing up, his eye on the birchwood<br>calendar. Out with it! Get it over! Yet his heart almost failed<br>him. The meanness of this hateful cadging! What would it all tot<br>up to, the money he had 'borrowed' from her in all these years?<br><br>'I say, Julia, I'm damned sorry--I hate asking you; but look here--'<br><br>'Yes, Gordon?' she said quietly. She knew what was coming.<br><br>'Look here, Julia, I'm damned sorry, but could you lend me five<br>bob?'<br><br>'Yes, Gordon, I expect so.'<br><br>She sought out the small, worn black leather purse that was hidden<br>at the bottom of her linen drawer. He knew what she was thinking.<br>It meant less for Christmas presents. That was the great event of<br>her life nowadays--Christmas and the giving of presents: hunting<br>through the glittering streets, late at night after the teashop was<br>shut, from one bargain counter to another, picking out the trash<br>that women are so curiously fond of. Handkerchief sachets, letter<br>racks, teapots, manicure sets, birchwood calendars with mottoes in<br>pokerwork. All through the year she was scraping from her wretched<br>wages for 'So-and-so's Christmas present', or 'So-and-so's birthday<br>present'. And had she not, last Christmas, because Gordon was<br>'fond of poetry', given him the Selected Poems of John Drinkwater<br>in green morocco, which he had sold for half a crown? Poor Julia!<br>Gordon made off with his five bob as soon as he decently could.<br>Why is it that one can't borrow from a rich friend and can from a<br>half-starved relative? But one's family, of course, 'don't count'.<br><br>On the top of the bus he did mental arithmetic. Thirteen and nine<br>in hand. Two day-returns to Slough, five bob. Bus fares, say two<br>bob more, seven bob. Bread and cheese and beer at a pub, say a bob<br>each, nine bob. Tea, eightpence each, twelve bob. A bob for<br>cigarettes, thirteen bob. That left ninepence for emergencies.<br>They would manage all right. And how about the rest of the week?<br>Not a penny for tobacco! But he refused to let it worry him.<br>Today would be worth it, anyway.<br><br>Rosemary met him on time. It was one of her virtues that she was<br>never late, and even at this hour of the morning she was bright and<br>debonair. She was rather nicely dressed, as usual. She was<br>wearing her mock-shovel hat again, because he had said he liked it.<br>They had the station practically to themselves. The huge grey<br>place, littered and deserted, had a blowsy, unwashed air, as though<br>it were still sleeping off a Saturday night debauch. A yawning<br>porter in need of a shave told them the best way to get to Burnham<br>Beeches, and presently they were in a third-class smoker, rolling<br>westward, and the mean wilderness of London was opening out and<br>giving way to narrow sooty fields dotted with ads for Carter's<br>Little Liver Pills. The day was very still and warm. Gordon's<br>prayer had come true. It was one of those windless days which you<br>can hardly tell from summer. You could feel the sun behind the<br>mist; it would break through presently, with any luck. Gordon and<br>Rosemary were profoundly and rather absurdly happy. There was a<br>sense of wild adventure in getting out of London, with the long day<br>in 'the country' stretching out ahead of them. It was months since<br>Rosemary and a year since Gordon had set foot in 'the country'.<br>They sat close together with the Sunday Times open across their<br>knees; they did not read it, however, but watched the fields and<br>cows and houses and the empty goods trucks and great sleeping<br>factories rolling past. Both of them enjoyed the railway journey<br>so much that they wished it had been longer.<br><br>At Slough they got out and travelled to Farnham Common in an absurd<br>chocolate-coloured bus with no top. Slough was still half asleep.<br>Rosemary remembered the way now that they had got to Farnham<br>Common. You walked down a rutted road and came out on to stretches<br>of fine, wet, tussocky grass dotted with little naked birches. The<br>beech woods were beyond. Not a bough or a blade was stirring. The<br>trees stood like ghosts in the still, misty air. Both Rosemary and<br>Gordon exclaimed at the loveliness of everything. The dew, the<br>stillness, the satiny stems of the birches, the softness of the<br>turf under your feet! Nevertheless, at first they felt shrunken<br>and out of place, as Londoners do when they get outside London.<br>Gordon felt as though he had been living underground for a long<br>time past. He felt etiolated and unkempt. He slipped behind<br>Rosemary as they walked, so that she should not see his lined,<br>colourless face. Also, they were out of breath before they had<br>walked far, because they were only used to London walking, and for<br>the first half hour they scarcely talked. They plunged into the<br>woods and started westward, with not much idea of where they were<br>making for--anywhere, so long as it was away from London. All<br>round them the beech-trees soared, curiously phallic with their<br>smooth skin-like bark and their flutings at the base. Nothing grew<br>at their roots, but the dried leaves were strewn so thickly that in<br>the distance the slopes looked like folds of copper-coloured silk.<br>Not a soul seemed to be awake. Presently Gordon came level with<br>Rosemary. They walked on hand in hand, swishing through the dry<br>coppery leaves that had drifted into the ruts. Sometimes they came<br>out on to stretches of road where they passed huge desolate houses--<br>opulent country houses, once, in the carriage days, but now<br>deserted and unsaleable. Down the road the mist-dimmed hedges wore<br>that strange purplish brown, the colour of brown madder, that naked<br>brushwood takes on in winter. There were a few birds about--jays,<br>sometimes, passing between the trees with dipping flight, and<br>pheasants that loitered across the road with long tails trailing,<br>almost as tame as hens, as though knowing they were safe on Sunday.<br>But in half an hour Gordon and Rosemary had not passed a human<br>being. Sleep lay upon the countryside. It was hard to believe<br>that they were only twenty miles out of London.<br><br>Presently they had walked themselves into trim. They had got their<br>second wind and the blood glowed in their veins. It was one of<br>those days when you feel you could walk a hundred miles if<br>necessary. Suddenly, as they came out on to the road again, the<br>dew all down the hedge glittered with a diamond flash. The sun had<br>pierced the clouds. The light came slanting and yellow across the<br>fields, and delicate unexpected colours sprang out in everything,<br>as though some giant's child had been let loose with a new<br>paintbox. Rosemary caught Gordon's arm and pulled him against her.<br><br>'Oh, Gordon, what a LOVELY day!'<br><br>'Lovely.'<br><br>'And, oh, look, look! Look at all the rabbits in that field!'<br><br>Sure enough, at the other end of the field, innumerable rabbits<br>were browsing, almost like a flock of sheep. Suddenly there was a<br>flurry under the hedge. A rabbit had been lying there. It leapt<br>from its nest in the grass with a flirt of dew and dashed away down<br>the field, its white tail lifted. Rosemary threw herself into<br>Gordon's arms. It was astonishingly warm, as warm as summer. They<br>pressed their bodies together in a sort of sexless rapture, like<br>children. Here in the open air he could see the marks of time<br>quite clearly upon her face. She was nearly thirty, and looked it,<br>and he was nearly thirty, and looked more; and it mattered nothing.<br>He pulled off the absurd flat hat. The three white hairs gleamed<br>on her crown. At the moment he did not wish them away. They were<br>part of her and therefore lovable.<br><br>'What fun to be here alone with you! I'm so glad we came!'<br><br>'And, oh, Gordon, to think we've got all day together! And it<br>might so easily have rained. How lucky we are!'<br><br>'Yes. We'll burn a sacrifice to the immortal gods, presently.'<br><br>They were extravagantly happy. As they walked on they fell into<br>absurd enthusiasms over everything they saw: over a jay's feather<br>that they picked up, blue as lapis lazuli; over a stagnant pool<br>like a jet mirror, with boughs reflected deep down in it; over the<br>fungi that sprouted from the trees like monstrous horizontal ears.<br>They discussed for a long time what would be the best epithet to<br>describe a beech-tree. Both agreed that beeches look more like<br>sentient creatures than other trees. It is because of the<br>smoothness of their bark, probably, and the curious limb-like way<br>in which the boughs sprout from the trunk. Gordon said that the<br>little knobs on the bark were like the nipples of breasts and that<br>the sinuous upper boughs, with their smooth sooty skin, were like<br>the writhing trunks of elephants. They argued about similes and<br>metaphors. From time to time they quarrelled vigorously, according<br>to their custom. Gordon began to tease her by finding ugly similes<br>for everything they passed. He said that the russet foliage of the<br>hornbeams was like the hair of Burne-Jones maidens, and that the<br>smooth tentacles of the ivy that wound about the trees were like<br>the clinging arms of Dickens heroines. Once he insisted upon<br>destroying some mauve toadstools because he said they reminded him<br>of a Rackham illustration and he suspected fairies of dancing round<br>them. Rosemary called him a soulless pig. She waded through a bed<br>of drifted beech leaves that rustled about her, knee-deep, like a<br>weightless red-gold sea.<br><br>'Oh, Gordon, these leaves! Look at them with the sun on them!<br>They're like gold. They really are like gold.'<br><br>'Fairy gold. You'll be going all Barrie in another moment. As a<br>matter of fact, if you want an exact simile, they're just the<br>colour of tomato soup.'<br><br>'Don't be a pig, Gordon! Listen how they rustle. "Thick as<br>autumnal leaves that strow the brooks in Vallombrosa."'<br><br>'Or like one of those American breakfast cereals. Truweet<br>Breakfast Crisps. "Kiddies clamour for their Breakfast Crisps."'<br><br>'You are a beast!'<br><br>She laughed. They walked on hand in hand, swishing ankle-deep<br>through the leaves and declaiming:<br><br><br>'Thick as the Breakfast Crisps that strow the plates<br>In Welwyn Garden City!'<br><br><br>It was great fun. Presently they came out of the wooded area.<br>There were plenty of people abroad now, but not many cars if you<br>kept away from the main roads. Sometimes they heard church bells<br>ringing and made detours to avoid the churchgoers. They began to<br>pass through straggling villages on whose outskirts pseudo-Tudor<br>villas stood sniffishly apart, amid their garages, their laurel<br>shrubberies and their raw-looking lawns. And Gordon had some fun<br>railing against the villas and the godless civilization of which<br>they were part--a civilization of stockbrokers and their lip-<br>sticked wives, of golf, whisky, ouija-boards, and Aberdeen terriers<br>called Jock. So they walked another four miles or so, talking and<br>frequently quarrelling. A few gauzy clouds were drifting across<br>the sky, but there was hardly a breath of wind.<br><br>They were growing rather footsore and more and more hungry. Of its<br>own accord the conversation began to turn upon food. Neither of<br>them had a watch, but when they passed through a village they saw<br>that the pubs were open, so that it must be after twelve o'clock.<br>They hesitated outside a rather low-looking pub called the Bird in<br>Hand. Gordon was for going in; privately he reflected that in a<br>pub like that your bread and cheese and beer would cost you a bob<br>at the very most. But Rosemary said that it was a nasty-looking<br>place, which indeed it was, and they went on, hoping to find a<br>pleasanter pub at the other end of the village. They had visions<br>of a cosy bar-parlour, with an oak settle and perhaps a stuffed<br>pike in a glass case on the wall.<br><br>But there were no more pubs in the village, and presently they were<br>in open country again, with no houses in sight and not even any<br>signposts. Gordon and Rosemary began to be alarmed. At two the<br>pubs would shut, and then there would be no food to be had, except<br>perhaps a packet of biscuits from some village sweetshop. At this<br>thought a ravening hunger took possession of them. They toiled<br>exhaustedly up an enormous hill, hoping to find a village on the<br>other side. There was no village, but far below a dark green river<br>wound, with what seemed quite like a large town scattered along its<br>edge and a grey bridge crossing it. They did not even know what<br>river it was--it was the Thames, of course.<br><br>'Thank God!' said Gordon. 'There must be plenty of pubs down<br>there. We'd better take the first one we can find.'<br><br>'Yes, do let's. I'm starving.'<br><br>But when they neared the town it seemed strangely quiet. Gordon<br>wondered whether the people were all at church or eating their<br>Sunday dinners, until he realized that the place was quite<br>deserted. It was Crickham-on-Thames, one of those riverside towns<br>which live for the boating season and go into hibernation for the<br>rest of the year. It straggled along the bank for a mile or more,<br>and it consisted entirely of boat-houses and bungalows, all of them<br>shut up and empty. There were no signs of life anywhere. At last,<br>however, they came upon a fat, aloof, red-nosed man, with a ragged<br>moustache, sitting on a camp-stool beside a jar of beer on the<br>towpath. He was fishing with a twenty-foot roach pole, while on<br>the smooth green water two swans circled about his float, trying to<br>steal his bait as often as he pulled it up.<br><br>'Can you tell us where we can get something to eat?' said Gordon.<br><br>The fat man seemed to have been expecting this question and to<br>derive a sort of private pleasure from it. He answered without<br>looking at Gordon.<br><br>'YOU won't get nothing to eat. Not here you won't,' he said.<br><br>'But dash it! Do you mean to say there isn't a pub in the whole<br>place? We've walked all the way from Farnham Common.'<br><br>The fat man sniffed and seemed to reflect, still keeping his eye on<br>the float. 'I dessay you might try the Ravenscroft Hotel,' he<br>said. 'About half a mile along, that is. I dessay they'd give you<br>something; that is, they would if they was open.'<br><br>'But ARE they open?'<br><br>'They might be and they might not,' said the fat man comfortably.<br><br>'And can you tell us what time it is?' said Rosemary.<br><br>'It's jest gone ten parse one.'<br><br>The two swans followed Gordon and Rosemary a little way along the<br>towpath, evidently expecting to be fed. There did not seem much<br>hope that the Ravenscroft Hotel would be open. The whole place had<br>that desolate flyblown air of pleasure resorts in the off-season.<br>The woodwork of the bungalows was cracking, the white paint was<br>peeling off, the dusty windows showed bare interiors. Even the<br>slot machines that were dotted along the bank were out of order.<br>There seemed to be another bridge at the other end of the town.<br>Gordon swore heartily.<br><br>'What bloody fools we were not to go in that pub when we had the<br>chance!'<br><br>'Oh, dear! I'm simply STARVING. Had we better turn back, do you<br>think?'<br><br>'It's no use, there were no pubs the way we came. We must keep on.<br>I suppose the Ravenscroft Hotel's on the other side of that bridge.<br>If that's a main road there's just a chance it'll be open.<br>Otherwise we're sunk.'<br><br>They dragged their way as far as the bridge. They were thoroughly<br>footsore now. But behold! here at last was what they wanted, for<br>just beyond the bridge, down a sort of private road, stood a<br>biggish, smartish hotel, its back lawns running down to the river.<br>It was obviously open. Gordon and Rosemary started eagerly towards<br>it, and then paused, daunted.<br><br>'It looks frightfully expensive,' said Rosemary.<br><br>It did look expensive. It was a vulgar pretentious place, all gilt<br>and white paint--one of those hotels which have overcharging and<br>bad service written on every brick. Beside the drive, commanding<br>the road, a snobbish board announced in gilt lettering:<br><br><br>THE RAVENSCROFT HOTEL<br><br>OPEN TO NON-RESIDENTS<br><br>LUNCHEONS-TEAS-DINNERS<br><br>DANCE HALL AND TENNIS COURTS<br><br>PARTIES CATERED FOR<br><br><br>Two gleaming two-seater cars were parked in the drive. Gordon<br>quailed. The money in his pocket seemed to shrink to nothing, this<br>was the very opposite to the cosy pub they had been looking for.<br>But he was very hungry. Rosemary tweaked at his arm.<br><br>'It looks a beastly place. I vote we go on.'<br><br>'But we've got to get some food. It's our last chance. We shan't<br>find another pub.'<br><br>'The food's always so disgusting in these places. Beastly cold<br>beef that tastes as if it had been saved up from last year. And<br>they charge you the earth for it.'<br><br>'Oh, well, we'll just order bread and cheese and beer. It always<br>costs about the same.'<br><br>'But they hate you doing that. They'll try to bully us into having<br>a proper lunch, you'll see. We must be firm and just say bread and<br>cheese.'<br><br>'All right, we'll be firm. Come on.'<br><br>They went in, resolved to be firm. But there was an expensive<br>smell in the draughty hallway--a smell of chintz, dead flowers,<br>Thames water, and the rinsings of wine bottles. It was the<br>characteristic smell of a riverside hotel. Gordon's heart sank<br>lower. He knew the type of place this was. It was one of those<br>desolate hotels which exist all along the motor roads and are<br>frequented by stockbrokers airing their whores on Sunday<br>afternoons. In such places you are insulted and overcharged almost<br>as a matter of course. Rosemary shrank nearer to him. She too was<br>intimidated. They saw a door marked 'Saloon' and pushed it open,<br>thinking it must be the bar. It was not a bar, however, but a<br>large, smart, chilly room with corduroy-upholstered chairs and<br>settees. You could have mistaken it for an ordinary drawing-room<br>except that all the ashtrays advertised White Horse whisky. And<br>round one of the tables the people from the cars outside--two<br>blond, flat-headed, fattish men, over-youthfully dressed, and two<br>disagreeable elegant young women--were sitting, having evidently<br>just finished lunch. A waiter, bending over their table, was<br>serving them with liqueurs.<br><br>Gordon and Rosemary had halted in the doorway. The people at the<br>table were already eyeing them with offensive upper-middle-class<br>eyes. Gordon and Rosemary looked tired and dirty, and they knew<br>it. The notion of ordering bread and cheese and beer had almost<br>vanished from their minds. In such a place as this you couldn't<br>possibly say 'Bread and cheese and beer'; 'Lunch' was the only<br>thing you could say. There was nothing for it but 'Lunch' or<br>flight. The waiter was almost openly contemptuous. He had summed<br>them up at a glance as having no money; but also he had divined<br>that it was in their minds to fly and was determined to stop them<br>before they could escape.<br><br>'Sare?' he demanded, lifting his tray off the table.<br><br>Now for it! Say 'Bread and cheese and beer', and damn the<br>consequences! Alas! his courage was gone. 'Lunch' it would have<br>to be. With a seeming-careless gesture he thrust his hand into his<br>pocket. He was feeling his money to make sure that it was still<br>there. Seven and elevenpence left, he knew. The waiter's eye<br>followed the movement; Gordon had a hateful feeling that the man<br>could actually see through the cloth and count the money in his<br>pocket. In a tone as lordly as he could make it, he remarked:<br><br>'Can we have some lunch, please?'<br><br>'Luncheon, sare? Yes, sare. Zees way.'<br><br>The waiter was a black-haired young man with a very smooth, well-<br>featured, sallow face. His dress clothes were excellently cut and<br>yet unclean-looking, as though he seldom took them off. He looked<br>like a Russian prince; probably he was an Englishman and had<br>assumed a foreign accent because this was proper in a waiter.<br>Defeated, Rosemary and Gordon followed him to the dining-room,<br>which was at the back, giving on to the lawn. It was exactly like<br>an aquarium. It was built entirely of greenish glass, and it was<br>so damp and chilly that you could almost have fancied yourself<br>under water. You could both see and smell the river outside. In<br>the middle of each of the small round tables there was a bowl of<br>paper flowers, but at one side, to complete the aquarium effect,<br>there was a whole florist's stand of evergreens, palms, and<br>aspidistras and so forth, like dreary water-plants. In summer such<br>a room might be pleasant enough; at present, when the sun had gone<br>behind a cloud, it was merely dank and miserable. Rosemary was<br>almost as much afraid of the waiter as Gordon was. As they sat<br>down and he turned away for a moment she made a face at his back.<br><br>'I'm going to pay for my own lunch,' she whispered to Gordon,<br>across the table.<br><br>'No, you're not.'<br><br>'What a horrible place! The food's sure to be filthy. I do wish<br>we hadn't come.'<br><br>'Sh!'<br><br>The waiter had come back with a flyblown printed menu. He handed<br>it to Gordon and stood over him with the menacing air of a waiter<br>who knows that you have not much money in your pocket. Gordon's<br>heart pounded. If it was a table d'hote lunch at three and<br>sixpence or even half a crown, they were sunk. He set his teeth<br>and looked at the menu. Thank God! It was a la carte. The<br>cheapest thing on the list was cold beef and salad for one and<br>sixpence. He said, or rather mumbled:<br><br>'We'll have some cold beef, please.'<br><br>The waiter's delicate eyebrows lifted. He feigned surprise.<br><br>'ONLY ze cold beef, sare?'<br><br>'Yes that'll do to go on with, anyway.'<br><br>'But you will not have ANYSING else, sare?'<br><br>'Oh, well. Bring us some bread, of course. And butter.'<br><br>'But no soup to start wiz, sare?'<br><br>'No. No soup.'<br><br>'Nor any fish, sare? Only ze cold beef?'<br><br>'Do we want any fish, Rosemary? I don't think we do. No. No<br>fish.'<br><br>'Nor any sweet to follow, sare? ONLY ze cold beef?'<br><br>Gordon had difficulty in controlling his features. He thought he<br>had never hated anyone so much as he hated this waiter.<br><br>'We'll tell you afterwards if we want anything else,' he said.<br><br>'And you will drink sare?'<br><br>Gordon had meant to ask for beer, but he hadn't the courage now.<br>He had got to win back his prestige after this affair of the cold<br>beef.<br><br>'Bring me the wine list,' he said flatly.<br><br>Another flyblown list was produced. All the wines looked<br>impossibly expensive. However, at the very top of the list there<br>was some nameless table claret at two and nine a bottle. Gordon<br>made hurried calculations. He could just manage two and nine. He<br>indicated the wine with his thumbnail.<br><br>'Bring us a bottle of this,' he said.<br><br>The waiter's eyebrows rose again. He essayed a stroke of irony.<br><br>'You will have ze WHOLE bottle, sare? You would not prefare ze<br>half bottle?'<br><br>'A whole bottle,' said Gordon coldly.<br><br>All in a single delicate movement of contempt the waiter inclined<br>his head, shrugged his left shoulder, and turned away. Gordon<br>could not stand it. He caught Rosemary's eye across the table.<br>Somehow or other they had got to put that waiter in his place! In<br>a moment the waiter came back, carrying the bottle of cheap wine by<br>the neck, and half concealing it behind his coat tails, as though<br>it were something a little indecent or unclean. Gordon had thought<br>of a way to avenge himself. As the waiter displayed the bottle he<br>put out a hand, felt it, and frowned.<br><br>'That's not the way to serve red wine,' he said.<br><br>Just for a moment the waiter was taken aback. 'Sare?' he said.<br><br>'It's stone cold. Take the bottle away and warm it.'<br><br>'Very good, sare.'<br><br>But it was not really a victory. The waiter did not look abashed.<br>Was the wine worth warming? his raised eyebrow said. He bore the<br>bottle away with easy disdain, making it quite clear to Rosemary<br>and Gordon that it was bad enough to order the cheapest wine on the<br>list without making this fuss about it afterwards.<br><br>The beef and salad were corpse-cold and did not seem like real food<br>at all. They tasted like water. The rolls, also, though stale,<br>were damp. The reedy Thames water seemed to have got into<br>everything. It was no surprise that when the wine was opened it<br>tasted like mud. But it was alcoholic, that was the great thing.<br>It was quite a surprise to find how stimulating it was, once you<br>had got it past your gullet and into your stomach. After drinking<br>a glass and a half Gordon felt very much better. The waiter stood<br>by the door, ironically patient, his napkin over his arm, trying to<br>make Gordon and Rosemary uncomfortable by his presence. At first<br>he succeeded, but Gordon's back was towards him, and he disregarded<br>him and presently almost forgot him. By degrees their courage<br>returned. They began to talk more easily and in louder voices.<br><br>'Look,' said Gordon. 'Those swans have followed us all the way up<br>here.'<br><br>Sure enough, there were the two swans sailing vaguely to and fro<br>over the dark green water. And at this moment the sun burst out<br>again and the dreary aquarium of a dining-room was flooded with<br>pleasant greenish light. Gordon and Rosemary felt suddenly warm<br>and happy. They began chattering about nothing, almost as though<br>the waiter had not been there, and Gordon took up the bottle and<br>poured out two more glasses of wine. Over their glasses their eyes<br>met. She was looking at him with a sort of yielding irony. 'I'm<br>your mistress,' her eyes said; 'what a joke!' Their knees were<br>touching under the small table; momentarily she squeezed his knee<br>between her own. Something leapt inside him; a warm wave of<br>sensuality and tenderness crept up his body. He had remembered!<br>She was his girl, his mistress. Presently, when they were alone,<br>in some hidden place in the warm, windless air, he would have her<br>naked body all for his own at last. True, all the morning he had<br>known this, but somehow the knowledge had been unreal. It was only<br>now that he grasped it. Without words said, with a sort of bodily<br>certainty, he knew that within an hour she would be in his arms,<br>naked. As they sat there in the warm light, their knees touching,<br>their eyes meeting, they felt as though already everything had been<br>accomplished. There was deep intimacy between them. They could<br>have sat there for hours, just looking at one another and talking<br>of trivial things that had meanings for them and for nobody else.<br>They did sit there for twenty minutes or more. Gordon had<br>forgotten the waiter--had even forgotten, momentarily, the disaster<br>of being let in for this wretched lunch that was going to strip him<br>of every penny he had. But presently the sun went in, the room<br>grew grey again, and they realized that it was time to go.<br><br>'The bill,' said Gordon, turning half round.<br><br>The waiter made a final effort to be offensive.<br><br>'Ze bill, sare? But you do not wish any coffee, sare?'<br><br>'No, no coffee. The bill.'<br><br>The waiter retired and came back with a folded slip on a salver.<br>Gordon opened it. Six and threepence--and he had exactly seven and<br>elevenpence in the world! Of course he had known approximately<br>what the bill must be, and yet it was a shock now that it came. He<br>stood up, felt in his pocket, and took out all his money. The<br>sallow young waiter, his salver on his arm, eyed the handful of<br>money; plainly he divined that it was all Gordon had. Rosemary<br>also had got up and come round the table. She pinched Gordon's<br>elbow; this was a signal that she would like to pay her share.<br>Gordon pretended not to notice. He paid the six and threepence,<br>and, as he turned away, dropped another shilling on to the salver.<br>The waiter balanced it for a moment on his hand, flicked it over,<br>and then slipped it into his waistcoat pocket with the air of<br>covering up something unmentionable.<br><br>As they went down the passage, Gordon felt dismayed, helpless--<br>dazed, almost. All his money gone at a single swoop! It was a<br>ghastly thing to happen. If only they had not come to this<br>accursed place! The whole day was ruined now--and all for the sake<br>of a couple of plates of cold beef and a bottle of muddy wine!<br>Presently there would be tea to think about, and he had only six<br>cigarettes left, and there were the bus fares back to Slough and<br>God knew what else; and he had just eightpence to pay for the lot!<br>They got outside the hotel feeling as if they had been kicked out<br>and the door slammed behind them. All the warm intimacy of a<br>moment ago was gone. Everything seemed different now that they<br>were outside. Their blood seemed to grow suddenly cooler in the<br>open air. Rosemary walked ahead of him, rather nervous, not<br>speaking. She was half frightened now by the thing she had<br>resolved to do. He watched her strong delicate limbs moving.<br>There was her body that he had wanted so long; but now when the<br>time had come it only daunted him. He wanted her to be his, he<br>wanted to HAVE HAD her, but he wished it were over and done with.<br>It was an effort--a thing he had got to screw himself up to. It<br>was strange that that beastly business of the hotel bill could have<br>upset him so completely. The easy carefree mood of the morning was<br>shattered; in its place there had come back the hateful, harassing,<br>familiar thing--worry about money. In a minute he would have to<br>own up that he had only eightpence left; he would have to borrow<br>money off her to get them home; it would be squalid and shameful.<br>Only the wine inside him kept up his courage. The warmth of the<br>wine, and the hateful feeling of having only eightpence left,<br>warred together in his body, neither getting the better of the<br>other.<br><br>They walked rather slowly, but soon they were away from the river<br>and on higher ground again. Each searched desperately for<br>something to say and could think of nothing. He came level with<br>her, took her hand, and wound her fingers within his own. Like<br>that they felt better. But his heart beat painfully, his entrails<br>were constricted. He wondered whether she felt the same.<br><br>'There doesn't seem to be a soul about,' she said at last.<br><br>'It's Sunday afternoon. They're all asleep under the aspidistra,<br>after roast beef and Yorkshire.'<br><br>There was another silence. They walked on fifty yards or so. With<br>difficulty mastering his voice, he managed to say:<br><br>'It's extraordinarily warm. We might sit down for a bit if we can<br>find a place.'<br><br>'Yes, all right. If you like.'<br><br>Presently they came to a small copse on the left of the road. It<br>looked dead and empty, nothing growing under the naked trees. But<br>at the corner of the copse, on the far side, there was a great<br>tangled patch of sloe or blackthorn bushes. He put his arm round<br>her without saying anything and turned her in that direction.<br>There was a gap in the hedge with some barbed wire strung across<br>it. He held the wire up for her and she slipped nimbly under it.<br>His heart leapt again. How supple and strong she was! But as he<br>climbed over the wire to follow her, the eightpence--a sixpence and<br>two pennies--clinked in his pocket, daunting him anew.<br><br>When they got to the bushes they found a natural alcove. On three<br>sides were beds of thorns, leafless but impenetrable, and on the<br>other side you looked downhill over a sweep of naked ploughed<br>fields. At the bottom of the hill stood a low-roofed cottage, tiny<br>as a child's toy, its chimneys smokeless. Not a creature was<br>stirring anywhere. You could not have been more alone than in such<br>a place. The grass was the fine mossy stuff that grows under<br>trees.<br><br>'We ought to have brought a mackintosh,' he said. He had knelt<br>down.<br><br>'It doesn't matter. The ground's fairly dry.'<br><br>He pulled her to the ground beside him, kissed her, pulled off the<br>flat felt hat, lay upon her breast to breast, kissed her face all<br>over. She lay under him, yielding rather than responding. She did<br>not resist when his hand sought her breasts. But in her heart she<br>was still frightened. She would do it--oh, yes! she would keep her<br>implied promise, she would not draw back; but all the same she was<br>frightened. And at heart he too was half reluctant. It dismayed<br>him to find how little, at this moment, he really wanted her. The<br>money-business still unnerved him. How can you make love when you<br>have only eightpence in your pocket and are thinking about it all<br>the time? Yet in a way he wanted her. Indeed, he could not do<br>without her. His life would be a different thing when once they<br>were really lovers. For a long time he lay on her breast, her head<br>turned sideways, his face against her neck and hair, attempting<br>nothing further.<br><br>Then the sun came out again. It was getting low in the sky now.<br>The warm light poured over them as though a membrane across the sky<br>had broken. It had been a little cold on the grass, really, with<br>the sun behind the clouds; but now once again it was almost as warm<br>as summer. Both of them sat up to exclaim at it.<br><br>'Oh, Gordon, look! Look how the sun's lighting everything up!'<br><br>As the clouds melted away a widening yellow beam slid swiftly<br>across the valley, gilding everything in its path. Grass that had<br>been dull green shone suddenly emerald. The empty cottage below<br>sprang out into warm colours, purply-blue of tiles, cherry-red of<br>brick. Only the fact that no birds were singing reminded you that<br>it was winter. Gordon put his arm round Rosemary and pulled her<br>hard against him. They sat cheek to cheek, looking down the hill.<br>He turned her round and kissed her.<br><br>'You do like me, don't you?'<br><br>'Adore you, silly.'<br><br>'And you're going to be nice to me, aren't you?'<br><br>'Nice to you?'<br><br>'Let me do what I want with you?'<br><br>'Yes, I expect so.'<br><br>'Anything?'<br><br>'Yes, all right. Anything.'<br><br>He pressed her back upon the grass. It was quite different now.<br>The warmth of the sun seemed to have got into their bones. 'Take<br>your clothes off, there's a dear,' he whispered. She did it<br>readily enough. She had no shame before him. Besides, it was so<br>warm and the place was so solitary that it did not matter how many<br>clothes you took off. They spread her clothes out and made a sort<br>of bed for her to lie on. Naked, she lay back, her hands behind<br>her head, her eyes shut, smiling slightly, as though she had<br>considered everything and were at peace in her mind. For a long<br>time he knelt and gazed at her body. Its beauty startled him. She<br>looked much younger naked than with her clothes on. Her face,<br>thrown back, with eyes shut, looked almost childish. He moved<br>closer to her. Once again the coins clinked in his pocket. Only<br>eightpence left! Trouble coming presently. But he wouldn't think<br>of it now. Get on with it, that's the great thing, get on with it<br>and damn the future! He put an arm beneath her and laid his body<br>to hers.<br><br>'May I?--now?'<br><br>'Yes. All right.'<br><br>'You're not frightened?'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'I'll be as gentle as I can with you.'<br><br>'It doesn't matter.'<br><br>A moment later:<br><br>'Oh, Gordon, no! No, no, no!'<br><br>'What? What is it?'<br><br>'No, Gordon, no! You mustn't! NO!'<br><br>She put her hands against him and pushed him violently back. Her<br>face looked remote, frightened, almost hostile. It was terrible to<br>feel her push him away at such a moment. It was as though cold<br>water had been dashed all over him. He fell back from her,<br>dismayed, hurriedly rearranging his clothes.<br><br>'What is it? What's the matter?'<br><br>'Oh, Gordon! I thought you--oh, dear!'<br><br>She threw her arm over her face and rolled over on her side, away<br>from him, suddenly ashamed.<br><br>'What is it?' he repeated.<br><br>'How could you be so THOUGHTLESS?'<br><br>'What do you mean--thoughtless?'<br><br>'Oh! you know what I mean!'<br><br>His heart shrank. He did know what she meant; but he had never<br>thought of it till this moment. And of course--oh, yes!--he ought<br>to have thought of it. He stood up and turned away from her.<br>Suddenly he knew that he could go no further with this business.<br>In a wet field on a Sunday afternoon--and in mid-winter at that!<br>Impossible! It seemed so right, so natural only a minute ago; now<br>it seemed merely squalid and ugly.<br><br>'I didn't expect THIS,' he said bitterly.<br><br>'But I couldn't help it, Gordon! You ought to have--you know.'<br><br>'You don't think I go in for that kind of thing, do you?'<br><br>'But what else can we do? I can't have a baby, can I?'<br><br>'You must take your chance.'<br><br>'Oh, Gordon, how impossible you are!'<br><br>She lay looking up at him, her face full of distress, too overcome<br>for the moment even to remember that she was naked. His<br>disappointment had turned to anger. There you are, you see! Money<br>again! Even the most secret action of your life you don't escape<br>it; you've still got to spoil everything with filthy cold-blooded<br>precautions for money's sake. Money, money, always money! Even in<br>the bridal bed, the finger of the money-god intruding! In the<br>heights or in the depths, he is there. He walked a pace or two up<br>and down, his hands in his pockets.<br><br>'Money again, you see!' he said. 'Even at a moment like this it's<br>got the power to stand over us and bully us. Even when we're alone<br>and miles from anywhere, with not a soul to see us.'<br><br>'What's MONEY got to do with it?'<br><br>'I tell you it'd never enter your head to worry about a baby if it<br>wasn't for the money. You'd WANT the baby if it wasn't for that.<br>You say you "can't" have a baby. What do you mean, you "can't"<br>have a baby? You mean you daren't; because you'd lose your job and<br>I've got no money and all of us would starve. This birth-control<br>business! It's just another way they've found out of bullying us.<br>And you want to acquiesce in it, apparently.'<br><br>'But what am I to do, Gordon? What am I to do?'<br><br>At this moment the sun disappeared behind the clouds. It became<br>perceptibly colder. After all, the scene was grotesque--the naked<br>woman lying in the grass, the dressed man standing moodily by with<br>his hands in his pockets. She'd catch her death of cold in another<br>moment, lying there like that. The whole thing was absurd and<br>indecent.<br><br>'But what else am I to do?' she repeated.<br><br>'I should think you might start by putting your clothes on,' he<br>said coldly.<br><br>He had only said it to avenge his irritation; but its result was to<br>make her so painfully and obviously embarrassed that he had to turn<br>his back on her. She had dressed herself in a very few moments.<br>As she knelt lacing up her shoes he heard her sniff once or twice.<br>She was on the point of crying and was struggling to restrain<br>herself. He felt horribly ashamed. He would have liked to throw<br>himself on his knees beside her, put his arms round her, and ask<br>her pardon. But he could do nothing of the kind; the scene had<br>left him lumpish and awkward. It was with difficulty that he could<br>command his voice even for the most banal remark.<br><br>'Are you ready?' he said flatly.<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>They went back to the road, climbed through the wire, and started<br>down the hill without another word. Fresh clouds were rolling<br>across the sun. It was getting much colder. Another hour and the<br>early dusk would have fallen. They reached the bottom of the hill<br>and came in sight of the Ravenscroft Hotel, scene of their<br>disaster.<br><br>'Where are we going?' said Rosemary in a small sulky voice.<br><br>'Back to Slough, I suppose. We must cross the bridge and have a<br>look at the signposts.'<br><br>They scarcely spoke again till they had gone several miles.<br>Rosemary was embarrassed and miserable. A number of times she<br>edged closer to him, meaning to take his arm, but he edged away<br>from her; and so they walked abreast with almost the width of the<br>road between them. She imagined that she had offended him<br>mortally. She supposed that it was because of his disappointment--<br>because she had pushed him away at the critical moment--that he was<br>angry with her; she would have apologized if he had given her a<br>quarter of a chance. But as a matter of fact he was scarcely<br>thinking of this any longer. His mind had turned away from that<br>side of things. It was the money-business that was troubling him<br>now--the fact that he had only eightpence in his pocket. In a very<br>little while he would have to confess it. There would be the bus<br>fares from Farnham to Slough, and tea in Slough, and cigarettes,<br>and more bus fares and perhaps another meal when they got back to<br>London; and just eightpence to cover the lot! He would have to<br>borrow from Rosemary after all. And that was so damned humiliating.<br>It is hateful to have to borrow money off someone you have just been<br>quarrelling with. What nonsense it made of all his fine attitudes!<br>There was he, lecturing her, putting on superior airs, pretending to<br>be shocked because she took contraception for granted; and the next<br>moment turning round and asking her for money! But there you are,<br>you see, that's what money can do. There is no attitude that money<br>or the lack of it cannot puncture.<br><br>By half past four it was almost completely dark. They tramped<br>along misty roads where there was no illumination save the cracks<br>of cottage windows and the yellow beam of an occasional car. It<br>was getting beastly cold, too, but they had walked four miles and<br>the exercise had warmed them. It was impossible to go on being<br>unsociable any longer. They began to talk more easily and by<br>degrees they edged closer together. Rosemary took Gordon's arm.<br>Presently she stopped him and swung him round to face her.<br><br>'Gordon, WHY are you so beastly to me?'<br><br>'How am I beastly to you?'<br><br>'Coming all this way without speaking a word!'<br><br>'Oh, well!'<br><br>'Are you still angry with me because of what happened just now?'<br><br>'No. I was never angry with you. YOU'RE not to blame.'<br><br>She looked up at him, trying to divine the expression of his face<br>in the almost pitch darkness. He drew her against him, and, as she<br>seemed to expect it, tilted her face back and kissed her. She<br>clung to him eagerly; her body melted against his. She had been<br>waiting for this, it seemed.<br><br>'Gordon, you do love me, don't you?'<br><br>'Of course I do.'<br><br>'Things went wrong somehow. I couldn't help it. I got frightened<br>suddenly.'<br><br>'It doesn't matter. Another time it'll be all right.'<br><br>She was lying limp against him, her head on his breast. He could<br>feel her heart beating. It seemed to flutter violently, as though<br>she were taking some decision.<br><br>'I don't care,' she said indistinctly, her face buried in his coat.<br><br>'Don't care about what?'<br><br>'The baby. I'll risk it. You can do what you like with me.'<br><br>At these surrendering words a weak desire raised itself in him and<br>died away at once. He knew why she had said it. It was not<br>because, at this moment, she really wanted to be made love to. It<br>was from a mere generous impulse to let him know that she loved him<br>and would take a dreaded risk rather than disappoint him.<br><br>'Now?' he said.<br><br>'Yes, if you like.'<br><br>He considered. He so wanted to be sure that she was his! But the<br>cold night air flowed over them. Behind the hedges the long grass<br>would be wet and chill. This was not the time or the place.<br>Besides, that business of the eightpence had usurped his mind. He<br>was not in the mood any longer.<br><br>'I can't,' he said finally.<br><br>'You can't! But, Gordon! I thought--'<br><br>'I know. But it's all different now.'<br><br>'You're still upset?'<br><br>'Yes. In a way.'<br><br>'Why?'<br><br>He pushed her a little away from him. As well have the explanation<br>now as later. Nevertheless he was so ashamed that he mumbled<br>rather than said:<br><br>'I've got a beastly thing to say to you. It's been worrying me all<br>the way along.'<br><br>'What is it?'<br><br>'It's this. Can you lend me some money? I'm absolutely cleaned<br>out. I had just enough money for today, but that beastly hotel<br>bill upset everything. I've only eightpence left.'<br><br>Rosemary was amazed. She broke right out of his arms in her<br>amazement.<br><br>'Only eightpence left! What ARE you talking about? What does it<br>matter if you've only eightpence left?'<br><br>'Don't I tell you I shall have to borrow money off you in another<br>minute? You'll have to pay for your own bus fares, and my bus<br>fares, and your tea and Lord knows what. And I asked you to come<br>out with me! You're supposed to be my guest. It's bloody.'<br><br>'Your GUEST! Oh, Gordon. Is THAT what's been worrying you all<br>this time?'<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>'Gordon, you ARE a baby! How can you let yourself be worried by a<br>thing like that? As though I minded lending you money! Aren't I<br>always telling you I want to pay my share when we go out together?'<br><br>'Yes, and you know how I hate your paying. We had that out the<br>other night.'<br><br>'Oh, how absurd, how absurd you are! Do you think there's anything<br>to be ashamed of in having no money?'<br><br>'Of course there is! It's the only thing in the world there IS to<br>be ashamed of.'<br><br>'But what's it got to do with you and me making love, anyway? I<br>don't understand you. First you want to and then you don't want<br>to. What's money got to do with it?'<br><br>'Everything.'<br><br>He wound her arm in his and started down the road. She would never<br>understand. Nevertheless he had got to explain.<br><br>'Don't you understand that one isn't a full human being--that one<br>doesn't FEEL a human being--unless one's got money in one's<br>pocket?'<br><br>'No. I think that's just silly.'<br><br>'It isn't that I don't want to make love to you. I do. But I tell<br>you I can't make love to you when I've only eightpence in my<br>pocket. At least when you know I've only eightpence. I just can't<br>do it. It's physically impossible.'<br><br>'But why? Why?'<br><br>'You'll find it in Lempriere,' he said obscurely.<br><br>That settled it. They talked no more about it. For the second<br>time he had behaved grossly badly and yet he had made her feel as<br>if it were she who was in the wrong. They walked on. She did not<br>understand him; on the other hand, she forgave him everything.<br>Presently they reached Farnham Common, and, after a wait at the<br>cross road, got a bus to Slough. In the darkness, as the bus<br>loomed near, Rosemary found Gordon's hand and slipped half a crown<br>into it, so that he might pay the fares and not be shamed in public<br>by letting a woman pay for him.<br><br>For his own part Gordon would sooner have walked to Slough and<br>saved the bus fares, but he knew Rosemary would refuse. In Slough,<br>also, he was for taking the train straight back to London, but<br>Rosemary said indignantly that she wasn't going to go without her<br>tea, so they went to a large, dreary, draughty hotel near the<br>station. Tea, with little wilting sandwiches and rock cakes like<br>balls of putty, was two shillings a head. It was torment to Gordon<br>to let her pay for his food. He sulked, ate nothing, and, after a<br>whispered argument, insisted on contributing his eightpence towards<br>the cost of the tea.<br><br>It was seven o'clock when they took the train back to London. The<br>train was full of tired hikers in khaki shorts. Rosemary and<br>Gordon did not talk much. They sat close together, Rosemary with<br>her arm twined through his, playing with his hand, Gordon looking<br>out of the window. People in the carriage eyed them, wondering<br>what they had quarrelled about. Gordon watched the lamp-starred<br>darkness streaming past. So the day to which he had looked forward<br>was ended. And now back to Willowbed Road, with a penniless week<br>ahead. For a whole week, unless some miracle happened, he wouldn't<br>even be able to buy himself a cigarette. What a bloody fool he had<br>been! Rosemary was not angry with him. By the pressure of her<br>hand she tried to make it clear to him that she loved him. His<br>pale discontented face, turned half away from her, his shabby coat,<br>and his unkempt mouse-coloured hair that wanted cutting more than<br>ever, filled her with profound pity. She felt more tenderly<br>towards him than she would have done if everything had gone well,<br>because in her feminine way she grasped that he was unhappy and<br>that life was difficult for him.<br><br>'See me home, will you?' she said as they got out at Paddington.<br><br>'If you don't mind walking. I haven't got the fare.'<br><br>'But let ME pay the fare. Oh, dear! I suppose you won't. But how<br>are you going to get home yourself?'<br><br>'Oh, I'll walk. I know the way. It's not very far.'<br><br>'I hate to think of you walking all that way. You look so tired.<br>Be a dear and let me pay your fare home. DO!'<br><br>'No. You've paid quite enough for me already.'<br><br>'Oh, dear! You are so silly!'<br><br>They halted at the entrance to the Underground. He took her hand.<br>'I suppose we must say good-bye for the present,' he said.<br><br>'Good-bye, Gordon dear. Thanks ever so much for taking me out. It<br>was such fun this morning.'<br><br>'Ah, this morning! It was different then.' His mind went back to<br>the morning hours, when they had been alone on the road together<br>and there was still money in his pocket. Compunction seized him.<br>On the whole he had behaved badly. He pressed her hand a little<br>tighter. 'You're not angry with me, are you?'<br><br>'No, silly, of course not.'<br><br>'I didn't mean to be beastly to you. It was the money. It's<br>always the money.'<br><br>'Never mind, it'll be better next time. We'll go to some better<br>place. We'll go down to Brighton for the week-end, or something.'<br><br>'Perhaps, when I've got the money. You will write soon, won't<br>you?'<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>'Your letters are the only things that keep me going. Tell me when<br>you'll write, so that I can have your letter to look forward to.'<br><br>'I'll write tomorrow night and post it on Tuesday. Then you'll get<br>it last post on Tuesday night.'<br><br>'Then good-bye, Rosemary dear.'<br><br>'Good-bye, Gordon darling.'<br><br>He left her at the booking-office. When he had gone twenty yards<br>he felt a hand laid on his arm. He turned sharply. It was<br>Rosemary. She thrust a packet of twenty Gold Flake, which she had<br>bought at the tobacco kiosk, into his coat pocket and ran back to<br>the Underground before he could protest.<br><br>He trailed homeward through the wastes of Marylebone and Regent's<br>Park. It was the fag-end of the day. The streets were dark and<br>desolate, with that strange listless feeling of Sunday night when<br>people are more tired after a day of idleness than after a day of<br>work. It was vilely cold, too. The wind had risen when the night<br>fell. Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over. Gordon was footsore,<br>having walked a dozen or fifteen miles, and also hungry. He had<br>had little food all day. In the morning he had hurried off without<br>a proper breakfast, and the lunch at the Ravenscroft Hotel wasn't<br>the kind of meal that did you much good; since then he had had no<br>solid food. However, there was no hope of getting anything when he<br>got home. He had told Mother Wisbeach that he would be away all<br>day.<br><br>When he reached the Hampstead Road he had to wait on the kerb to<br>let a stream of cars go past. Even here everything seemed dark and<br>gloomy, in spite of the glaring lamps and the cold glitter of the<br>jewellers' windows. The raw wind pierced his thin clothes, making<br>him shiver. Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over The bending<br>poplars, newly bare. He had finished that poem, all except the<br>last two lines. He thought again of those hours this morning--the<br>empty misty roads, the feeling of freedom and adventure, of having<br>the whole day and the whole country before you in which to wander<br>at will. It was having money that did it, of course. Seven and<br>elevenpence he had had in his pocket this morning. It had been a<br>brief victory over the money-god; a morning's apostasy, a holiday<br>in the groves of Ashtaroth. But such things never last. Your<br>money goes and your freedom with it. Circumcise ye your foreskins,<br>saith the Lord. And back we creep, duly snivelling.<br><br>Another shoal of cars swam past. One in particular caught his eye,<br>a long slender thing, elegant as a swallow, all gleaming blue and<br>silver; a thousand guineas it would have cost, he thought. A blue-<br>clad chauffeur sat at the wheel, upright, immobile, like some<br>scornful statue. At the back, in the pink-lit interior, four<br>elegant young people, two youths, and two girls, were smoking<br>cigarettes and laughing. He had a glimpse of sleek bunny-faces;<br>faces of ravishing pinkness and smoothness, lit by that peculiar<br>inner glow that can never be counterfeited, the soft warm radiance<br>of money.<br><br>He crossed the road. No food tonight. However, there was still<br>oil in the lamp, thank God; he would have a secret cup of tea when<br>he got back. At this moment he saw himself and his life without<br>saving disguises. Every night the same--back to the cold lonely<br>bedroom and the grimy littered sheets of the poem that never got<br>any further. It was a blind alley. He would never finish London<br>Pleasures, he would never marry Rosemary, he would never set his<br>life in order. He would only drift and sink, drift and sink, like<br>the others of his family; but worse than them--down, down into some<br>dreadful sub-world that as yet he could only dimly imagine. It was<br>what he had chosen when he declared war on money. Serve the money-<br>god or go under; there is no other rule.<br><br>Something deep below made the stone street shiver. The tube-train,<br>sliding through middle earth. He had a vision of London, of the<br>western world; he saw a thousand million slaves toiling and<br>grovelling about the throne of money. The earth is ploughed, ships<br>sail, miners sweat in dripping tunnels underground, clerks hurry<br>for the eight-fifteen with the fear of the boss eating at their<br>vitals. And even in bed with their wives they tremble and obey.<br>Obey whom? The money-priesthood, the pink-faced masters of the<br>world. The Upper Crust. A welter of sleek young rabbits in<br>thousand guinea motor cars, of golfing stockbrokers and<br>cosmopolitan financiers, of Chancery lawyers and fashionable Nancy<br>boys, of bankers, newspaper peers, novelists of all four sexes,<br>American pugilists, lady aviators, film stars, bishops, titled<br>poets, and Chicago gorillas.<br><br>When he had gone another fifty yards the rhyme for the final stanza<br>of his poem occurred to him. He walked homeward, repeating the<br>poem to himself:<br><br><br>Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over<br>The bending poplars, newly bare,<br>And the dark ribbons of the chimneys<br>Veer downward; flicked by whips of air,<br><br>Torn posters flutter; coldly sound<br>The boom of trains and the rattle of hooves,<br>And the clerks who hurry to the station<br>Look, shuddering, over the eastern rooves,<br><br>Thinking, each one, 'Here comes the winter!<br>Please God I keep my job this year!'<br>And bleakly, as the cold strikes through<br>Their entrails like an icy spear,<br><br>They think of rent, rates, season tickets,<br>Insurance, coal, the skivvy's wages,<br>Boots, school-bills, and the next instalment<br>Upon the two twin beds from Drage's.<br><br>For if in careless summer days<br>In groves of Ashtaroth we whored,<br>Repentant now, when winds blow cold,<br>We kneel before our rightful lord;<br><br>The lord of all, the money-god,<br>Who rules us blood and hand and brain,<br>Who gives the roof that stops the wind,<br>And, giving, takes away again;<br><br>Who spies with jealous, watchful care,<br>Our thoughts, our dreams, our secret ways,<br>Who picks our words and cuts our clothes,<br>And maps the pattern of our days;<br><br>Who chills our anger, curbs our hope,<br>And buys our lives and pays with toys,<br>Who claims as tribute broken faith,<br>Accepted insults, muted joys;<br><br>Who binds with chains the poet's wit,<br>The navvy's strength, the soldier's pride,<br>And lays the sleek, estranging shield<br>Between the lover and his bride. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/6.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/8.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
