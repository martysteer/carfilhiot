<h2>Chapter 4</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over<br>The bending poplars, newly bare.<br><br><br>As a matter of fact, though, there was not a breath of wind that<br>afternoon. It was almost as mild as spring. Gordon repeated to<br>himself the poem he had begun yesterday, in a cadenced whisper,<br>simply for the pleasure of the sound of it. He was pleased with<br>the poem at this moment. It was a good poem--or would be when it<br>was finished, anyway. He had forgotten that last night it had<br>almost made him sick.<br><br>The plane trees brooded motionless, dimmed by faint wreaths of<br>mist. A tram boomed in the valley far below. Gordon walked up<br>Malkin Hill, rustling instep-deep through the dry, drifted leaves.<br>All down the pavement they were strewn, crinkly and golden, like<br>the rustling flakes of some American breakfast cereal; as though<br>the queen of Brobdingnag had upset her packet of Truweet Breakfast<br>Crisps down the hillside.<br><br>Jolly, the windless winter days! Best time of all the year--or so<br>Gordon thought at this moment. He was as happy as you can be when<br>you haven't smoked all day and have only three-halfpence and a Joey<br>in the world. This was Thursday, early-closing day and Gordon's<br>afternoon off. He was going to the house of Paul Doring, the<br>critic, who lived in Coleridge Grove and gave literary tea-parties.<br><br>It had taken him an hour or more to get himself ready. Social life<br>is so complicated when your income is two quid a week. He had had<br>a painful shave in cold water immediately after dinner. He had put<br>on his best suit--three years old but just passable when he<br>remembered to press the trousers under his mattress. He had turned<br>his collar inside out and tied his tie so that the torn place<br>didn't show. With the point of a match he had scraped enough<br>blacking from the tin to polish his shoes. He had even borrowed a<br>needle from Lorenheim and darned his socks--a tedious job, but<br>better than inking the places where your ankle shows through. Also<br>he had procured an empty Gold Flake packet and put into it a single<br>cigarette extracted from the penny-in-the-slot-machine. That was<br>just for the look of the thing. You can't, of course, go to other<br>people's houses with NO cigarettes. But if you have even one it's<br>all right, because when people see one cigarette in a packet they<br>assume that the packet has been full. It is fairly easy to pass<br>the thing off as an accident.<br><br>'Have a cigarette?' you say casually to someone.<br><br>'Oh--thanks.'<br><br>You push the packet open and then register surprise. 'Hell! I'm<br>down to my last. And I could have sworn I had a full packet.'<br><br>'Oh, I won't take your last. Have one of MINE,' says the other.<br><br>'Oh--thanks.'<br><br>And after that, of course, your host and hostess press cigarettes<br>upon you. But you must have ONE cigarette, just for honour's sake.<br><br>Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over. He would finish that poem<br>presently. He could finish it whenever he chose. It was queer,<br>how the mere prospect of going to a literary tea-party bucked him<br>up. When your income is two quid a week you at least aren't jaded<br>by too much human contact. Even to see the inside of somebody<br>else's house is a kind of treat. A padded armchair under your bum,<br>and tea and cigarettes and the smell of women--you learn to<br>appreciate such things when you are starved of them. In practice,<br>though, Doring's parties never in the least resembled what Gordon<br>looked forward to. Those wonderful, witty, erudite conversations<br>that he imagined beforehand--they never happened or began to<br>happen. Indeed there was never anything that could properly be<br>called conversation at all; only the stupid clacking that goes on<br>at parties everywhere, in Hampstead or Hong Kong. No one really<br>worth meeting ever came to Doring's parties. Doring was such a<br>very mangy lion himself that his followers were hardly even worthy<br>to be called jackals. Quite half of them were those hen-witted<br>middle-aged women who have lately escaped from good Christian homes<br>and are trying to be literary. The star exhibits were troops of<br>bright young things who dropped in for half an hour, formed circles<br>of their own, and talked sniggeringly about the other bright young<br>things to whom they referred by nicknames. For the most part<br>Gordon found himself hanging about on the edges of conversations.<br>Doring was kind in a slapdash way and introduced him to everybody<br>as 'Gordon Comstock--YOU know; the poet. He wrote that dashed<br>clever book of poems called Mice. YOU know.' But Gordon had never<br>yet encountered anybody who DID know. The bright young things<br>summed him up at a glance and ignored him. He was thirtyish, moth-<br>eaten, and obviously penniless. And yet, in spite of the<br>invariable disappointment, how eagerly he looked forward to those<br>literary tea-parties! They were a break in his loneliness, anyway.<br>That is the devilish thing about poverty, the ever-recurrent thing--<br>loneliness. Day after day with never an intelligent person to<br>talk to; night after night back to your godless room, always alone.<br>Perhaps it sounds rather fun if you are rich and sought-after; but<br>how different it is when you do it from necessity!<br><br>Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over. A stream of cars hummed<br>easily up the hill. Gordon eyed them without envy. Who wants a<br>car, anyway? The pink doll-faces of upper-class women gazed at him<br>through the car window. Bloody nit-witted lapdogs. Pampered<br>bitches dozing on their chains. Better the lone wolf than the<br>cringing dogs. He thought of the Tube stations at early morning.<br>The black hordes of clerks scurrying underground like ants into a<br>hole; swarms of little ant-like men, each with dispatch-case in<br>right hand, newspaper in left hand, and the fear of the sack like a<br>maggot in his heart. How it eats at them, that secret fear!<br>Especially on winter days, when they hear the menace of the wind.<br>Winter, the sack, the workhouse, the Embankment benches! Ah!<br><br><br>Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over<br>The bending poplars, newly bare,<br>And the dark ribbons of the chimneys<br>Veer downward; flicked by whips of air,<br>Torn posters flutter; Coldly sound<br>The boom of trains and the rattle of hooves,<br>And the clerks who hurry to the station<br>Look, shuddering, over the eastern rooves,<br>Thinking--<br><br><br>What do they think? Winter's coming. Is my job safe? The sack<br>means the workhouse. Circumcise ye your foreskins, saith the Lord.<br>Suck the blacking off the boss's boots. Yes!<br><br><br>Thinking each one, 'Here comes the winter!<br>Please God I keep my job this year!'<br>And bleakly, as the cold strikes through<br>Their entrails like an icy spear,<br>They think--<br><br><br>'Think' again. No matter. What do they think? Money, money!<br>Rent, rates, taxes, school bills, season tickets, boots for the<br>children. And the life insurance policy and the skivvy's wages.<br>And, my God, suppose the wife gets in the family way again! And<br>did I laugh loud enough when the boss made that joke yesterday?<br>And the next instalment on the vacuum cleaner.<br><br>Neatly, taking a pleasure in his neatness, with the sensation of<br>dropping piece after piece of a jigsaw puzzle into place, he<br>fashioned another stanza:<br><br><br>They think of rent, rates, season tickets,<br>Insurance, coal, the skivvy's wages,<br>Boots, school bills, and the next instalment<br>Upon the two twin beds from Drage's.<br><br><br>Not bad, not bad at all. Finish it presently. Four or five more<br>stanzas. Ravelston would print it.<br><br>A starling sat in the naked boughs of a plane tree, crooning self-<br>pitifully as starlings do on warm winter days when they believe<br>spring is in the air. At the foot of the tree a huge sandy cat sat<br>motionless, mouth open, gazing upwards with rapt desire, plainly<br>expecting that the starling would drop into its mouth. Gordon<br>repeated to himself the four finished stanzas of his poem. It was<br>GOOD. Why had he thought last night that it was mechanical, weak,<br>and empty? He was a poet. He walked more upright, arrogantly<br>almost, with the pride of a poet. Gordon Comstock, author of Mice.<br>'Of exceptional promise,' The Times Lit. Supp. had said. Author<br>also of London Pleasures. For that too would be finished quite<br>soon. He knew now that he could finish it when he chose. Why had<br>he ever despaired of it? Three months it might take; soon enough<br>to come out in the summer. In his mind's eye he saw the 'slim'<br>white buckram shape of London Pleasures; the excellent paper, the<br>wide margins, the good Caslon type, the refined dust-jacket, and<br>the reviews in all the best papers. 'An outstanding achievement'--<br>The Times Lit. Supp. 'A welcome relief from the Sitwell school'--<br>Scrutiny.<br><br>Coleridge Grove was a damp, shadowy, secluded road, a blind alley<br>and therefore void of traffic. Literary associations of the wrong<br>kind (Coleridge was rumoured to have lived there for six weeks in<br>the summer of 1821) hung heavy upon it. You could not look at its<br>antique decaying houses, standing back from the road in dank<br>gardens under heavy trees, without feeling an atmosphere of<br>outmoded 'culture' envelop you. In some of those houses,<br>undoubtedly, Browning Societies still flourished, and ladies in art<br>serge sat at the feet of extinct poets talking about Swinburne and<br>Walter Pater. In spring the gardens were sprinkled with purple and<br>yellow crocuses, and later with harebells, springing up in little<br>Wendy rings among the anaemic grass; and even the trees, it seemed<br>to Gordon, played up to their environment and twisted themselves<br>into whimsy Rackhamesque attitudes. It was queer that a prosperous<br>hack critic like Paul Doring should live in such a place. For<br>Doring was an astonishingly bad critic. He reviewed novels for the<br>Sunday Post and discovered the great English novel with Walpolean<br>regularity once a fortnight. You would have expected him to live<br>in a flat on Hyde Park Corner. Perhaps it was a kind of penance<br>that he had imposed upon himself, as though by living in the<br>refined discomfort of Coleridge Grove he propitiated the injured<br>gods of literature.<br><br>Gordon came round the corner, turning over in his mind a line from<br>London Pleasures. And then suddenly he stopped short. There was<br>something wrong about the look of the Dorings' gate. What was it?<br>Ah, of course! There were no cars waiting outside.<br><br>He paused, walked on a step or two, and stopped again, like a dog<br>that smells danger. It was all wrong. There OUGHT to be some<br>cars. There were always quite a lot of people at the Dorings'<br>parties, and half of them came in cars. Why had nobody else<br>arrived? Could he be too early? But no! They had said half past<br>three and it was at least twenty to four.<br><br>He hastened towards the gate. Already he felt practically sure<br>that the party HAD been put off. A chill like the shadow of a<br>cloud had fallen across him. Suppose the Dorings weren't at home!<br>Suppose the party had been put off! And this thought, though it<br>dismayed him, did not strike him as in the least improbable. It<br>was his special bugbear, the especial childish dread he carried<br>about with him, to be invited to people's houses and then find them<br>not at home. Even when there was no doubt about the invitation he<br>always half expected that there would be some hitch or other. He<br>was never quite certain of his welcome. He took it for granted<br>that people would snub him and forget about him. Why not, indeed?<br>He had no money. When you have no money your life is one long<br>series of snubs.<br><br>He swung the iron gate open. It creaked with a lonely sound. The<br>dank mossy path was bordered with chunks of some Rackhamesque<br>pinkish stone. Gordon inspected the house-front narrowly. He was<br>so used to this kind of thing. He had developed a sort of Sherlock<br>Holmes technique for finding out whether a house was inhabited or<br>not. Ah! Not much doubt about it this time. The house had a<br>deserted look. No smoke coming from the chimneys, no windows<br>lighted. It must be getting darkish indoors--surely they would<br>have lighted the lamps? And there was not a single footmark on the<br>steps; that settled it. Nevertheless with a sort of desperate hope<br>he tugged at the bell. An old-fashioned wire bell, of course. In<br>Coleridge Grove it would have been considered low and unliterary to<br>have an electric bell.<br><br>Clang, clang, clang! went the bell.<br><br>Gordon's last hope vanished. No mistaking the hollow clangour of a<br>bell echoing through an empty house. He seized the handle again<br>and gave it a wrench that almost broke the wire. A frightful,<br>clamorous peal answered him. But it was useless, quite useless.<br>Not a foot stirred within. Even the servants were out. At this<br>moment he became aware of a lace cap, some dark hair, and a pair of<br>youthful eyes regarding him furtively from the basement of the<br>house next door. It was a servant-girl who had come out to see<br>what all the noise was about. She caught his eye and gazed into<br>the middle distance. He looked a fool and knew it. One always<br>does look a fool when one rings the bell of an empty house. And<br>suddenly it came to him that that girl knew all about him--knew<br>that the party had been put off and that everyone except Gordon had<br>been told of it--knew that it was because he had no money that he<br>wasn't worth the trouble of telling. SHE knew. Servants always<br>know.<br><br>He turned and made for the gate. Under the servant's eye he had to<br>stroll casually away, as though this were a small disappointment<br>that scarcely mattered. But he was trembling so with anger that it<br>was difficult to control his movements. The sods! The bloody<br>sods! To have played a trick like that on him! To have invited<br>him, and then changed the day and not even bothered to tell him!<br>There might be other explanations--he just refused to think of<br>them. The sods, the bloody sods! His eye fell upon one of the<br>Rackhamesque chunks of stone. How he'd love to pick that thing up<br>and bash it through the window! He grasped the rusty gate-bar so<br>hard that he hurt his hand and almost tore it. The physical pain<br>did him good. It counteracted the agony at his heart. It was not<br>merely that he had been cheated of an evening spent in human<br>company, though that was much. It was the feeling of helplessness,<br>of insignificance, of being set aside, ignored--a creature not<br>worth worrying about. They'd changed the day and hadn't even<br>bothered to tell him. Told everybody else, but not him. That's<br>how people treat you when you've no money! Just wantonly, cold-<br>bloodedly insult you. It was likely enough, indeed, that the<br>Dorings' had honestly forgotten, meaning no harm; it was even<br>possible that he himself had mistaken the date. But no! He<br>wouldn't think of it. The Dorings' had done it on purpose. Of<br>COURSE they had done it on purpose! Just hadn't troubled to tell<br>him, because he had no money and consequently didn't matter. The<br>sods!<br><br>He walked rapidly away. There was a sharp pain in his breast.<br>Human contact, human voices! But what was the good of wishing?<br>He'd have to spend the evening alone, as usual. His friends were<br>so few and lived so far away. Rosemary would still be at work;<br>besides, she lived at the back of beyond, in West Kensington, in a<br>women's hostel guarded by female dragons. Ravelston lived nearer,<br>in the Regent's Park district. But Ravelston was a rich man and<br>had many engagements; the chances were always against his being at<br>home. Gordon could not even ring him up, because he hadn't the<br>necessary two pennies; only three halfpence and the Joey. Besides,<br>how could he go and see Ravelston when he had no money? Ravelston<br>would be sure to say 'Let's go to a pub,' or something! He<br>couldn't let Ravelston pay for his drinks. His friendship with<br>Ravelston was only possible on the understanding that he paid his<br>share of everything.<br><br>He took out his single cigarette and lighted it. It gave him no<br>pleasure to smoke, walking fast; it was a mere reckless gesture.<br>He did not take much notice of where he was going. All he wanted<br>was to tire himself, to walk and walk till the stupid physical<br>fatigue had obliterated the Dorings' snub. He moved roughly<br>southward--through the wastes of Camden Town, down Tottenham Court<br>Road. It had been dark for some time now. He crossed Oxford<br>Street, threaded through Covent Garden, found himself in the<br>Strand, and crossed the river by Waterloo Bridge. With night the<br>cold had descended. As he walked his anger grew less violent, but<br>his mood could not fundamentally improve. There was a thought that<br>kept haunting him--a thought from which he fled, but which was not<br>to be escaped. It was the thought of his poems. His empty, silly,<br>futile poems! How could he ever have believed in them? To think<br>that actually he had imagined, so short a time ago, that even<br>London Pleasures might one day come to something! It made him sick<br>to think of his poems now. It was like remembering last night's<br>debauch. He knew in his bones that he was no good and his poems<br>were no good. London Pleasures would never be finished. If he<br>lived to be a thousand he would never write a line worth reading.<br>Over and over, in self-hatred, he repeated those four stanzas of<br>the poem he had been making up. Christ, what tripe! Rhyme to<br>rhyme--tinkle, tinkle, tinkle! Hollow as an empty biscuit tin.<br>THAT was the kind of muck he had wasted his life on.<br><br>He had walked a long way, five or seven miles perhaps. His feet<br>were hot and swollen from the pavements. He was somewhere in<br>Lambeth, in a slummy quarter where the narrow, puddled street<br>plunged into blackness at fifty yards' distance. The few lamps,<br>mist-ringed, hung like isolated stars, illumining nothing save<br>themselves. He was getting devilishly hungry. The coffee-shops<br>tempted him with their steamy windows and their chalked signs:<br>'Good Cup of Tea, 2d. No Urns Used.' But it was no use, he<br>couldn't spend his Joey. He went under some echoing railway arches<br>and up the alley on to Hungerford Bridge. On the miry water, lit<br>by the glare of skysigns, the muck of East London was racing<br>inland. Corks, lemons, barrel-staves, a dead dog, hunks of bread.<br>Gordon walked along the Embankment to Westminster. The wind made<br>the plane trees rattle. Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over. He<br>winced. That tripe again! Even now, though it was December, a few<br>poor draggled old wrecks were settling down on the benches, tucking<br>themselves up in sort of parcels of newspaper. Gordon looked at<br>them callously. On the bum, they called it. He would come to it<br>himself some day. Better so, perhaps? He never felt any pity for<br>the genuine poor. It is the black-coated poor, the middle-middle<br>class, who need pitying.<br><br>He walked up to Trafalgar Square. Hours and hours to kill. The<br>National Gallery? Ah, shut long ago, of course. It would be. It<br>was a quarter past seven. Three, four, five hours before he could<br>sleep. He walked seven times round the square, slowly. Four times<br>clockwise, three times widdershins. His feet were sore and most of<br>the benches were empty, but he would not sit down. If he halted<br>for an instant the longing for tobacco would come upon him. In the<br>Charing Cross Road the teashops called like sirens. Once the glass<br>door of a Lyons swung open, letting out a wave of hot cake-scented<br>air. It almost overcame him. After all, why NOT go in? You could<br>sit there for nearly an hour. A cup of tea twopence, two buns a<br>penny each. He had fourpence halfpenny, counting the Joey. But<br>no! That bloody Joey! The girl at the cash desk would titter. In<br>a vivid vision he saw the girl at the cash desk, as she handled his<br>threepenny-bit, grin sidelong at the girl behind the cake-counter.<br>They'd KNOW it was your last threepence. No use. Shove on. Keep<br>moving.<br><br>In the deadly glare of the Neon lights the pavements were densely<br>crowded. Gordon threaded his way, a small shabby figure, with pale<br>face and unkempt hair. The crowd slid past him; he avoided and was<br>avoided. There is something horrible about London at night; the<br>coldness, the anonymity, the aloofness. Seven million people,<br>sliding to and fro, avoiding contact, barely aware of one another's<br>existence, like fish in an aquarium tank. The street swarmed with<br>pretty girls. By scores they streamed past him, their faces<br>averted or unseeing; cold nymph-creatures, dreading the eyes of the<br>male. It was queer how many of them seemed to be alone, or with<br>another girl. Far more women alone than women with men, he noted.<br>That too was money. How many girls alive wouldn't be manless<br>sooner than take a man who's moneyless?<br><br>The pubs were open, oozing sour whiffs of beer. People were<br>trickling by ones and twos into the picture-houses. Gordon halted<br>outside a great garish picture-house, under the weary eye of the<br>commissionaire, to examine the photographs. Greta Garbo in The<br>Painted Veil. He yearned to go inside, not for Greta's sake, but<br>just for the warmth and the softness of the velvet seat. He hated<br>the pictures, of course, seldom went there even when he could<br>afford it. Why encourage the art that is destined to replace<br>literature? But still, there is a kind of soggy attraction about<br>it. To sit on the padded seat in the warm smoke-scented darkness,<br>letting the flickering drivel on the screen gradually overwhelm<br>you--feeling the waves of its silliness lap you round till you seem<br>to drown, intoxicated, in a viscous sea--after all, it's the kind<br>of drug we need. The right drug for friendless people. As he<br>approached the Palace Theatre a tart on sentry-go under the porch<br>marked him down, stepped forward, and stood in his path. A short,<br>stocky Italian girl, very young, with big black eyes. She looked<br>agreeable, and, what tarts so seldom are, merry. For a moment he<br>checked his step, even allowing himself to catch her eye. She<br>looked up at him, ready to break out into a broad-lipped smile.<br>Why not stop and talk to her? She looked as though she might<br>understand him. But no! No money! He looked away and side-<br>stepped her with the cold haste of a man whom poverty makes<br>virtuous. How furious she'd be if he stopped and then she found he<br>had no money! He pressed on. Even to talk costs money.<br><br>Up Tottenham Court Road and Camden Road it was a dreary drudge. He<br>walked slower, dragging his feet a little. He had done ten miles<br>over pavements. More girls streamed past, unseeing. Girls alone,<br>girls with youths, girls with other girls, girls alone. Their<br>cruel youthful eyes went over him and through him as though he had<br>not existed. He was too tired to resent it. His shoulders<br>surrendered to their weariness; he slouched, not trying any longer<br>to preserve his upright carriage and his you-be-damned air. They<br>flee from me that someone did me seek. How could you blame them?<br>He was thirty, moth-eaten, and without charm. Why should any girl<br>ever look at him again?<br><br>He reflected that he must go home at once if he wanted any food--<br>for Ma Wisbeach refused to serve meals after nine o'clock. But the<br>thought of his cold womanless bedroom sickened him. To climb the<br>stairs, light the gas, flop down at the table with hours to kill<br>and nothing to do, nothing to read, nothing to smoke--no, NOT<br>endurable. In Camden Town the pubs were full and noisy, though<br>this was only Thursday. Three women, red-armed, squat as the beer<br>mugs in their hands, stood outside a pub door, talking. From<br>within came hoarse voices, fag-smoke, the fume of beer. Gordon<br>thought of the Crichton Arms. Flaxman might be there. Why not<br>risk it? A half of bitter, threepence halfpenny. He had fourpence<br>halfpenny counting the Joey. After all, a Joey IS legal tender.<br><br>He felt dreadfully thirsty already. It had been a mistake to let<br>himself think of beer. As he approached the Crichton, he heard<br>voices singing. The great garish pub seemed to be more brightly<br>lighted than usual. There was a concert of something going on<br>inside. Twenty ripe male voices were chanting in unison:<br><br><br>'Fo--or REE'S a jorrigoo' fellow,<br>For REE'S a jorrigoo' fellow,<br>For REE'S a jorrigoo' fe--ELL--OW--<br>And toori oori us!'<br><br><br>At least, that was what it sounded like. Gordon drew nearer,<br>pierced by a ravishing thirst. The voices were so soggy, so<br>infinitely beery. When you heard them you saw the scarlet faces of<br>prosperous plumbers. There was a private room behind the bar where<br>the Buffaloes held their secret conclaves. Doubtless it was they<br>who were singing. They were giving some kind of commemorative<br>booze to their president, secretary, Grand Herbivore, or whatever<br>he is called. Gordon hesitated outside the Saloon bar. Better to<br>go to the public bar, perhaps. Draught beer in the public, bottled<br>beer in the saloon. He went round to the other side of the pub.<br>The beer-choked voices followed him:<br><br><br>'With a toori oori ay.<br>An' a toori oori ay!<br><br>'Fo--or REE'S a jorrigoo' fellow,<br>For REE'S a jorrigoo' fellow--'<br><br><br>He felt quite faint for a moment. But it was fatigue and hunger as<br>well as thirst. He could picture the cosy room where those<br>Buffaloes were singing; the roaring fire, the big shiny table, the<br>bovine photographs on the wall. Could picture also, as the singing<br>ceased, twenty scarlet faces disappearing into pots of beer. He<br>put his hand into his pocket and made sure that the threepenny-bit<br>was still there. After all, why not? In the public bar, who would<br>comment? Slap the Joey down on the bar and pass it off as a joke.<br>'Been saving that up from the Christmas pudding--ha, ha!' Laughter<br>all round. Already he seemed to have the metallic taste of draught<br>beer on his tongue.<br><br>He fingered the tiny disc, irresolute. The Buffaloes had tuned up<br>again:<br><br><br>'With a toori oori ay,<br>An' a toori oori ay!<br><br>'Fo--or REE'S a jorrigoo' fellow--'<br><br><br>Gordon moved back to the saloon bar. The window was frosted, and<br>also steamy from the heat inside. Still, there were chinks where<br>you could see through. He peeped in. Yes, Flaxman was there.<br><br>The saloon bar was crowded. Like all rooms seen from the outside,<br>it looked ineffably cosy. The fire that blazed in the grate<br>danced, mirrored, in the brass spittoons. Gordon thought he could<br>almost smell the beer through the glass. Flaxman was propping up<br>the bar with two fish-faced pals who looked like insurance-touts of<br>the better type. One elbow on the bar, his foot on the rail, a<br>beer-streaked glass in the other hand, he was swapping backchat<br>with the blonde cutie barmaid. She was standing on a chair behind<br>the bar, ranging the bottled beer and talking saucily over her<br>shoulder. You couldn't hear what they were saying, but you could<br>guess. Flaxman let fall some memorable witticism. The fish-faced<br>men bellowed with obscene laughter. And the blonde cutie,<br>tittering down at him, half shocked and half delighted, wriggled<br>her neat little bum.<br><br>Gordon's heart sickened. To be in there, just to be in there!<br>In the warmth and light, with people to talk to, with beer and<br>cigarettes and a girl to flirt with! After all, why NOT go in?<br>You could borrow a bob off Flaxman. Flaxman would lend it to you<br>all right. He pictured Flaxman's careless assent--'What ho,<br>chappie! How's life? What? A bob? Sure! Take two. Catch,<br>chappie!'--and the florin flicked along the beer-wet bar. Flaxman<br>was a decent sort, in his way.<br><br>Gordon put his hand against the swing door. He even pushed it open<br>a few inches. The warm fog of smoke and beer slipped through the<br>crack. A familiar, reviving smell; nevertheless as he smelled it<br>his nerve failed him. No! Impossible to go in. He turned away.<br>He couldn't go shoving in that saloon bar with only fourpence<br>halfpenny in his pocket. Never let other people buy your drinks<br>for you! The first commandment of the moneyless. He made off,<br>down the dark pavement.<br><br><br>'For REE'S a jorrigoo' fe--ELL--OW--<br>And toori oori us!<br><br>'With a toori oori, ay!<br>An' a-'<br><br><br>The voices, diminishing with distance, rolled after him, bearing<br>faint tidings of beer. Gordon took the threepenny-bit from his<br>pocket and sent it skimming away into the darkness.<br><br>He was going home, if you could call it 'going'. At any rate he<br>was gravitating in that direction. He did not want to go home, but<br>he had got to sit down. His legs ached and his feet were bruised,<br>and that vile bedroom was the sole place in London where he had<br>purchased the right to sit down. He slipped in quietly, but, as<br>usual, not quite so quietly that Mrs Wisbeach failed to hear him.<br>She gave him a brief nosy glance round the corner of her door. It<br>would be a little after nine. She might get him a meal if he asked<br>her. But she would grizzle and make a favour of it, and he would<br>go to bed hungry sooner than face that.<br><br>He started up the stairs. He was half way up the first flight when<br>a double knock behind made him jump. The post! Perhaps a letter<br>from Rosemary!<br><br>Forced from outside, the letter flap lifted, and with an effort,<br>like a heron regurgitating a flatfish, vomited a bunch of letters<br>on to the mat. Gordon's heart bounded. There were six or seven of<br>them. Surely among all that lot there must be one for himself!<br>Mrs Wisbeach, as usual, had darted from her lair at the sound of<br>the postman's knock. As a matter of fact, in two years Gordon had<br>never once succeeded in getting hold of a letter before Mrs<br>Wisbeach laid hands on it. She gathered the letters jealously to<br>her breast, and then, holding them up one at a time, scanned their<br>addresses. From her manner you could gather that she suspected<br>each one of them of containing a writ, an improper love letter, or<br>an ad for Amen Pills.<br><br>'One for you, Mr Comstock,' she said sourly, handing him a letter.<br><br>His heart shrank and paused in its beat. A long-shaped envelope.<br>Not from Rosemary, therefore. Ah! It was addressed in his own<br>handwriting. From the editor of a paper, then. He had two poems<br>'out' at present. One with the Californian Review, the other with<br>the Primrose Quarterly. But this wasn't an American stamp. And<br>the Primrose had had his poem at least six weeks! Good God,<br>supposing they'd accepted it!<br><br>He had forgotten Rosemary's existence. He said 'Thanks!', stuck<br>the letter in his pocket, and started up the stairs with outward<br>calm, but no sooner was he out of Mrs Wisbeach's sight that he<br>bounded up three steps at a time. He had got to be alone to open<br>that letter. Even before he reached the door he was feeling for<br>his matchbox, but his fingers were trembling so that in lighting<br>the gas he chipped the mantle. He sat down, took the letter from<br>his pocket, and then quailed. For a moment he could not nerve<br>himself to open it. He held it up to the light and felt it to see<br>how thick it was. His poem had been two sheets. Then, calling<br>himself a fool, he ripped the envelope open. Out tumbled his own<br>poem, and with it a neat--oh, so neat!--little printed slip of<br>imitation parchment:<br><br><br>The Editor regrets that he is unable to make use of the enclosed<br>contribution.<br><br><br>The slip was decorated with a design of funereal laurel leaves.<br><br>Gordon gazed at the thing with wordless hatred. Perhaps no snub in<br>the world is so deadly as this, because none is so unanswerable.<br>Suddenly he loathed his own poem and was acutely ashamed of it. He<br>felt it the weakest, silliest poem ever written. Without looking<br>at it again he tore it into small bits and flung them into the<br>wastepaper basket. He would put that poem out of his mind for<br>ever. The rejection slip, however, he did not tear up yet. He<br>fingered it, feeling its loathly sleekness. Such an elegant little<br>thing, printed in admirable type. You could tell at a glance that<br>it came from a 'good' magazine--a snooty highbrow magazine with the<br>money of a publishing house behind it. Money, money! Money and<br>culture! It was a stupid thing that he had done. Fancy sending a<br>poem to a paper like the Primrose! As though they'd accept poems<br>from people like HIM. The mere fact that the poem wasn't typed<br>would tell them what kind of person he was. He might as well have<br>dropped a card on Buckingham Palace. He thought of the people who<br>wrote for the Primrose; a coterie of moneyed highbrows--those<br>sleek, refined young animals who suck in money and culture with<br>their mother's milk. The idea of trying to horn in among that<br>pansy crowd! But he cursed them all the same. The sods! The<br>bloody sods! 'The Editor regrets!' Why be so bloody mealy-mouthed<br>about it? Why not say outright, 'We don't want your bloody poems.<br>We only take poems from chaps we were at Cambridge with. You<br>proletarians keep your distance'? The bloody, hypocritical sods!<br><br>At last he crumpled up the rejection slip, threw it away, and stood<br>up. Better get to bed while he had the energy to undress. Bed was<br>the only place that was warm. But wait. Wind the clock, set the<br>alarm. He went through the familiar action with a sense of deadly<br>staleness. His eye fell upon the aspidistra. Two years he had<br>inhabited this vile room; two mortal years in which nothing had<br>been accomplished. Seven hundred wasted days, all ending in the<br>lonely bed. Snubs, failures, insults, all of them unavenged.<br>Money, money, all is money! Because he had no money the Dorings'<br>snubbed him, because he had no money the Primrose had turned down<br>his poem, because he had no money Rosemary wouldn't sleep with him.<br>Social failure, artistic failure, sexual failure--they are all the<br>same. And lack of money is at the bottom of them all.<br><br>He must hit back at somebody or something. He could not go to bed<br>with that rejection slip as the last thing in his mind. He thought<br>of Rosemary. It was five days now since she had written. If there<br>had been a letter from her this evening even that rap over the<br>knuckles from the Primrose Quarterly would have mattered less. She<br>declared that she loved him, and she wouldn't sleep with him,<br>wouldn't even write to him! She was the same as all the others.<br>She despised him and forgot about him because he had no money and<br>therefore didn't matter. He would write her an enormous letter,<br>telling her what it felt like to be ignored and insulted, making<br>her see how cruelly she had treated him.<br><br>He found a clean sheet of paper and wrote in the top right-hand<br>corner:<br><br>'31 Willowbed Road, NW, 1 December, 9.30 p.m.'<br><br>But having written that much, he found that he could write no more.<br>He was in the defeated mood when even the writing of a letter is<br>too great an effort. Besides, what was the use? She would never<br>understand. No woman ever understands. But he must write<br>something. Something to wound her--that was what he most wanted,<br>at this moment. He meditated for a long time, and at last wrote,<br>exactly in the middle of the sheet:<br><br><br>You have broken my heart.<br><br><br>No address, no signature. Rather neat it looked, all by itself,<br>there in the middle of the sheet, in his small 'scholarly'<br>handwriting. Almost like a little poem in itself. This thought<br>cheered him up a little.<br><br>He stuck the letter in an envelope and went out and posted it at<br>the post office on the corner, spending his last three halfpence on<br>a penny stamp and a halfpenny stamp out of the slot machine. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/3.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/5.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
