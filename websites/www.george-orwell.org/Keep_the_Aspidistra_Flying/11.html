<h2>Chapter 11</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Spring, spring! Bytuene Mershe ant Averil, when spray biginneth to<br>spring! When shaws be sheene and swards full fayre, and leaves<br>both large and longe! When the hounds of spring are on winter's<br>traces, in the spring time, the only pretty ring time, when the<br>birds do sing, hey-ding-a-ding ding, cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-wee, ta-<br>witta-woo! And so on and so on and so on. See almost any poet<br>between the Bronze Age and 1805.<br><br>But how absurd that even now, in the era of central heating and<br>tinned peaches, a thousand so-called poets are still writing in the<br>same strain! For what difference does spring or winter or any<br>other time of year make to the average civilized person nowadays?<br>In a town like London the most striking seasonal change, apart from<br>the mere change of temperature, is in the things you see lying<br>about on the pavement. In late winter it is mainly cabbage leaves.<br>In July you tread on cherry stones, in November on burnt-out<br>fireworks. Towards Christmas the orange peel grows thicker. It<br>was a different matter in the Middle Ages. There was some sense in<br>writing poems about spring when spring meant fresh meat and green<br>vegetables after months of frowsting in some windowless hut on a<br>diet of salt fish and mouldy bread.<br><br>If it was spring Gordon failed to notice it. March in Lambeth did<br>not remind you of Persephone. The days grew longer, there were<br>vile dusty winds and sometimes in the sky patches of harsh blue<br>appeared. Probably there were a few sooty buds on the trees if you<br>cared to look for them. The aspidistra, it turned out, had not<br>died after all; the withered leaves had dropped off it, but it was<br>putting forth a couple of dull green shoots near its base.<br><br>Gordon had been three months at the library now. The stupid<br>slovenly routine did not irk him. The library had swelled to a<br>thousand 'assorted titles' and was bringing Mr Cheeseman a pound a<br>week clear profit, so Mr Cheeseman was happy after his fashion.<br>He was, nevertheless, nurturing a secret grudge against Gordon.<br>Gordon had been sold to him, so to speak, as a drunkard. He had<br>expected Gordon to get drunk and miss a day's work at least once,<br>thus giving a sufficient pretext for docking his wages; but Gordon<br>had failed to get drunk. Queerly enough, he had no impulse to<br>drink nowadays. He would have gone without beer even if he could<br>have afforded it. Tea seemed a better poison. All his desires and<br>discontents had dwindled. He was better off on thirty bob a week<br>than he had been previously on two pounds. The thirty bob covered,<br>without too much stretching, his rent, cigarettes, a washing bill<br>of about a shilling a week, a little fuel, and his meals, which<br>consisted almost entirely of bacon, bread-and-marg, and tea, and<br>cost about two bob a day, gas included. Sometimes he even had<br>sixpence over for a seat at a cheap but lousy picture-house near<br>the Westminster Bridge Road. He still carried the grimy manuscript<br>of London Pleasures to and fro in his pocket, but it was from mere<br>force of habit; he had dropped even the pretence of working. All<br>his evenings were spent in the same way. There in the remote<br>frowzy attic, by the fire if there was any coal left, in bed if<br>there wasn't, with teapot and cigarettes handy, reading, always<br>reading. He read nothing nowadays except twopenny weekly papers.<br>Tit Bits, Answers, Peg's Paper, The Gem, The Magnet, Home Notes,<br>The Girl's Own Paper--they were all the same. He used to get them<br>a dozen at a time from the shop. Mr Cheeseman had great dusty<br>stacks of them, left over from his uncle's day and used for<br>wrapping paper. Some of them were as much as twenty years old.<br><br>He had not seen Rosemary for weeks past. She had written a number<br>of times and then, for some reason, abruptly stopped writing.<br>Ravelston had written once, asking him to contribute an article on<br>twopenny libraries to Antichrist. Julia had sent a desolate little<br>letter, giving family news. Aunt Angela had had bad colds all the<br>winter, and Uncle Walter was complaining of bladder trouble.<br>Gordon did not answer any of their letters. He would have<br>forgotten their existence if he could. They and their affection<br>were only an encumbrance. He would not be free, free to sink down<br>into the ultimate mud, till he had cut his links with all of them,<br>even with Rosemary.<br><br>One afternoon he was choosing a book for a tow-headed factory girl,<br>when someone he only saw out of the corner of his eye came into the<br>library and hesitated just inside the door.<br><br>'What kind of book did you want?' he asked the factory girl.<br><br>'Oo--jest a kind of a ROmance, please.'<br><br>Gordon selected a ROmance. As he turned, his heart bounded<br>violently. The person who had just come in was Rosemary. She did<br>not make any sign, but stood waiting, pale, and worried-looking,<br>with something ominous in her appearance.<br><br>He sat down to enter the book on the girl's ticket, but his hands<br>had begun trembling so that he could hardly do it. He pressed the<br>rubber stamp in the wrong place. The girl trailed out, peeping<br>into the book as she went. Rosemary was watching Gordon's face.<br>It was a long time since she had seen him by daylight, and she was<br>struck by the change in him. He was shabby to the point of<br>raggedness, his face had grown much thinner and had the dingy,<br>greyish pallor of people who live on bread and margarine. He<br>looked much older--thirty-five at the least. But Rosemary herself<br>did not look quite as usual. She had lost her gay trim bearing,<br>and her clothes had the appearance of having been thrown on in a<br>hurry. It was obvious that there was something wrong.<br><br>He shut the door after the factory girl. 'I wasn't expecting you,'<br>he began.<br><br>'I had to come. I got away from the studio at lunch time. I told<br>them I was ill.'<br><br>'You don't look well. Here, you'd better sit down.'<br><br>There was only one chair in the library. He brought it out from<br>behind the desk and was moving towards her, rather vaguely, to<br>offer some kind of caress. Rosemary did not sit down, but laid her<br>small hand, from which she had removed the glove, on the top rung<br>of the chair-back. By the pressure of her fingers he could see how<br>agitated she was.<br><br>'Gordon, I've a most awful thing to tell you. It's happened after<br>all.'<br><br>'What's happened?'<br><br>'I'm going to have a baby.'<br><br>'A baby? Oh, Christ!'<br><br>He stopped short. For a moment he felt as though someone had<br>struck him a violent blow under the ribs. He asked the usual<br>fatuous question:<br><br>'Are you sure?'<br><br>'Absolutely. It's been weeks now. If you knew the time I've had!<br>I kept hoping and hoping--I took some pills--oh, it was too<br>beastly!'<br><br>'A baby! Oh, God, what fools we were! As though we couldn't have<br>foreseen it!'<br><br>'I know. I suppose it was my fault. I--'<br><br>'Damn! Here comes somebody.'<br><br>The door-bell ping'd. A fat, freckled woman with an ugly under-lip<br>came in at a rolling gait and demanded 'Something with a murder in<br>it.' Rosemary had sat down and was twisting her glove round and<br>round her fingers. The fat woman was exacting. Each book that<br>Gordon offered her she refused on the ground that she had 'had it<br>already' or that it 'looked dry'. The deadly news that Rosemary<br>had brought had unnerved Gordon. His heart pounding, his entrails<br>constricted, he had to pull out book after book and assure the fat<br>woman that this was the very book she was looking for. At last,<br>after nearly ten minutes, he managed to fob her off with something<br>which she said grudgingly she 'didn't think she'd had before'.<br><br>He turned back to Rosemary. 'Well, what the devil are we going to<br>do about it?' he said as soon as the door had shut.<br><br>'I don't see what I can do. If I have this baby I'll lose my job,<br>of course. But it isn't only that I'm worrying about. It's my<br>people finding out. My mother--oh, dear! It simply doesn't bear<br>thinking of.'<br><br>'Ah, your people! I hadn't thought of them. One's people! What a<br>cursed incubus they are!'<br><br>'MY people are all right. They've always been good to me. But<br>it's different with a thing like this.'<br><br>He took a pace or two up and down. Though the news had scared him<br>he had not really grasped it as yet. The thought of a baby, his<br>baby, growing in her womb had awoken in him no emotion except<br>dismay. He did not think of the baby as a living creature; it was<br>a disaster pure and simple. And already he saw where it was going<br>to lead.<br><br>'We shall have to get married, I suppose,' he said flatly.<br><br>'Well, shall we? That's what I came here to ask you.'<br><br>'But I suppose you want me to marry you, don't you?'<br><br>'Not unless YOU want to. I'm not going to tie you down. I know<br>it's against your ideas to marry. You must decide for yourself.'<br><br>'But we've no alternative--if you're really going to have this<br>baby.'<br><br>'Not necessarily. That's what you've got to decide. Because after<br>all there IS another way.'<br><br>'What way?'<br><br>'Oh, YOU know. A girl at the studio gave me an address. A friend<br>of hers had it done for only five pounds.'<br><br>That pulled him up. For the first time he grasped, with the only<br>kind of knowledge that matters, what they were really talking<br>about. The words 'a baby' took on a new significance. They did<br>not mean any longer a mere abstract disaster, they meant a bud of<br>flesh, a bit of himself, down there in her belly, alive and<br>growing. His eyes met hers. They had a strange moment of sympathy<br>such as they had never had before. For a moment he did feel that<br>in some mysterious way they were one flesh. Though they were feet<br>apart he felt as though they were joined together--as though some<br>invisible living cord stretched from her entrails to his. He knew<br>then that it was a dreadful thing they were contemplating--a<br>blasphemy, if that word had any meaning. Yet if it had been put<br>otherwise he might not have recoiled from it. It was the squalid<br>detail of the five pounds that brought it home.<br><br>'No fear!' he said. 'Whatever happens we're not going to do THAT.<br>It's disgusting.'<br><br>'I know it is. But I can't have the baby without being married.'<br><br>'No! If that's the alternative I'll marry you. I'd sooner cut my<br>right hand off than do a thing like that.'<br><br>Ping! went the door-bell. Two ugly louts in cheap bright blue<br>suits, and a girl with a fit of the giggles, came in. One of the<br>youths asked with a sort of sheepish boldness for 'something with<br>a kick in it--something smutty'. Silently, Gordon indicated the<br>shelves where the 'sex' books were kept. There were hundreds of<br>them in the library. They had titles like Secrets of Paris and The<br>Man She Trusted; on their tattered yellow jackets were pictures of<br>half-naked girls lying on divans with men in dinner-jackets<br>standing over them. The stories inside, however, were painfully<br>harmless. The two youths and the girl ranged among them,<br>sniggering over the pictures on their covers, the girl letting out<br>little squeals and pretending to be shocked. They disgusted Gordon<br>so much that he turned his back on them till they had chosen their<br>books.<br><br>When they had gone he came back to Rosemary's chair. He stood<br>behind her, took hold of her small firm shoulders, then slid a hand<br>inside her coat and felt the warmth of her breast. He liked the<br>strong springy feeling of her body; he liked to think that down<br>there, a guarded seed, his baby was growing. She put a hand up and<br>caressed the hand that was on her breast, but did not speak. She<br>was waiting for him to decide.<br><br>'If I marry you I shall have to turn respectable,' he said<br>musingly.<br><br>'Could you?' she said with a touch of her old manner.<br><br>'I mean I shall have to get a proper job--go back to the New<br>Albion. I suppose they'd take me back.'<br><br>He felt her grow very still and knew that she had been waiting for<br>this. Yet she was determined to play fair. She was not going to<br>bully him or cajole him.<br><br>'I never said I wanted you to do that. I want you to marry me--<br>yes, because of the baby. But it doesn't follow you've got to keep<br>me.'<br><br>'There's no sense in marrying if I can't keep you. Suppose I<br>married you when I was like I am at present--no money and no proper<br>job? What would you do then?'<br><br>'I don't know. I'd go on working as long as I could. And<br>afterwards, when the baby got too obvious--well, I suppose I'd<br>have to go home to father and mother.'<br><br>'That would be jolly for you, wouldn't it? But you were so anxious<br>for me to go back to the New Albion before. You haven't changed<br>your mind?'<br><br>'I've thought things over. I know you'd hate to be tied to a<br>regular job. I don't blame you. You've got your own life to<br>live.'<br><br>He thought it over a little while longer. 'It comes down to this.<br>Either I marry you and go back to the New Albion, or you go to one<br>of those filthy doctors and get yourself messed about for five<br>pounds.'<br><br>At this she twisted herself out of his grasp and stood up facing<br>him. His blunt words had upset her. They had made the issue<br>clearer and uglier than before.<br><br>'Oh, why did you say that?'<br><br>'Well, those ARE the alternatives.'<br><br>'I'd never thought of it like that. I came here meaning to be<br>fair. And now it sounds as if I was trying to bully you into it--<br>trying to play on your feelings by threatening to get rid of the<br>baby. A sort of beastly blackmail.'<br><br>'I didn't mean that. I was only stating facts.'<br><br>Her face was full of lines, the black brows drawn together. But<br>she had sworn to herself that she would not make a scene. He could<br>guess what this meant to her. He had never met her people, but he<br>could imagine them. He had some notion of what it might mean to go<br>back to a country town with an illegitimate baby; or, what was<br>almost as bad, with a husband who couldn't keep you. But she was<br>going to play fair. No blackmail! She drew a sharp inward breath,<br>taking a decision.<br><br>'All right, then, I'm not going to hold THAT over your head. It's<br>too mean. Marry me or don't marry me, just as you like. But I'll<br>have the baby, anyway.'<br><br>'You'd do that? Really?'<br><br>'Yes, I think so.'<br><br>He took her in his arms. Her coat had come open, her body was warm<br>against him. He thought he would be a thousand kinds of fool if he<br>let her go. Yet the alternative was impossible, and he did not see<br>it any less clearly because he held her in his arms.<br><br>'Of course, you'd like me to go back to the New Albion,' he said.<br><br>'No, I wouldn't. Not if you don't want to.'<br><br>'Yes, you would. After all, it's natural. You want to see me<br>earning a decent income again. In a GOOD job, with four pounds a<br>week and an aspidistra in the window. Wouldn't you, now? Own up.'<br><br>'All right, then--yes, I would. But it's only something I'd LIKE<br>to see happening; I'm not going to MAKE you do it. I'd just hate<br>you to do it if you didn't really want to. I want you to feel<br>free.'<br><br>'Really and truly free?'<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>'You know what that means? Supposing I decided to leave you and<br>the baby in the lurch?'<br><br>'Well--if you really wanted to. You're free--quite free.'<br><br>After a little while she went away. Later in the evening or<br>tomorrow he would let her know what he decided. Of course it was<br>not absolutely certain that the New Albion would give him a job<br>even if he asked them; but presumably they would, considering what<br>Mr Erskine had said. Gordon tried to think and could not. There<br>seemed to be more customers than usual this afternoon. It maddened<br>him to have to bounce out of his chair every time he had sat down<br>and deal with some fresh influx of fools demanding crime-stories<br>and sex-stories and ROmances. Suddenly, about six o'clock, he<br>turned out the lights, locked up the library, and went out. He had<br>got to be alone. The library was not due to shut for two hours<br>yet. God knew what Mr Cheeseman would say when he found out. He<br>might even give Gordon the sack. Gordon did not care.<br><br>He turned westward, up Lambeth Cut. It was a dull sort of evening,<br>not cold. There was muck underfoot, white lights, and hawkers<br>screaming. He had got to think this thing out, and he could think<br>better walking. But it was so hard, so hard! Back to the New<br>Albion, or leave Rosemary in the lurch; there was no other<br>alternative. It was no use thinking, for instance, that he might<br>find some 'good' job which would offend his sense of decency a bit<br>less. There aren't so many 'good' jobs waiting for moth-eaten<br>people of thirty. The New Albion was the only chance he had or<br>ever would have.<br><br>At the corner, on the Westminster Bridge Road, he paused a moment.<br>There were some posters opposite, livid in the lamplight. A<br>monstrous one, ten feet high at least, advertised Bovex. The Bovex<br>people had dropped Corner Table and got on to a new tack. They<br>were running a series of four-line poems--Bovex Ballads, they were<br>called. There was a picture of a horribly eupeptic family, with<br>grinning ham-pink faces, sitting at breakfast; underneath, in<br>blatant lettering:<br><br><br>Why should YOU be thin and white?<br>And have that washed-out feeling?<br>Just take hot Bovex every night--<br>Invigorating--healing!<br><br><br>Gordon gazed at the thing. He drank in its puling silliness. God,<br>what trash! 'Invigorating--healing!' The weak incompetence of it!<br>It hadn't even the vigorous badness of the slogans that really<br>stick. Just soppy, lifeless drivel. It would have been almost<br>pathetic in its feebleness if one hadn't reflected that all over<br>London and all over every town in England that poster was<br>plastered, rotting the minds of men. He looked up and down the<br>graceless street. Yes, war is coming soon. You can't doubt it<br>when you see the Bovex ads. The electric drills in our streets<br>presage the rattle of the machine-guns. Only a little while before<br>the aeroplanes come. Zoom--bang! A few tons of T.N.T. to send our<br>civilization back to hell where it belongs.<br><br>He crossed the road and walked on, southward. A curious thought<br>had struck him. He did not any longer want that war to happen. It<br>was the first time in months--years, perhaps--that he had thought<br>of it and not wanted it.<br><br>If he went back to the New Albion, in a month's time he might be<br>writing Bovex Ballads himself. To go back to THAT! Any 'good' job<br>was bad enough; but to be mixed up in THAT! Christ! Of course he<br>oughtn't to go back. It was just a question of having the guts to<br>stand firm. But what about Rosemary? He thought of the kind of<br>life she would live at home, in her parents' house, with a baby and<br>no money; and of the news running through that monstrous family<br>that Rosemary had married some awful rotter who couldn't even keep<br>her. She would have the whole lot of them nagging at her together.<br>Besides, there was the baby to think about. The money-god is so<br>cunning. If he only baited his traps with yachts and race-horses,<br>tarts and champagne, how easy it would be to dodge them. It is<br>when he gets at you through your sense of decency that he finds you<br>helpless.<br><br>The Bovex Ballad jungled in Gordon's head. He ought to stand firm.<br>He had made war on money--he ought to stick it out. After all,<br>hitherto he HAD stuck it out, after a fashion. He looked back over<br>his life. No use deceiving himself. It had been a dreadful life--<br>lonely, squalid, futile. He had lived thirty years and achieved<br>nothing except misery. But that was what he had chosen. It was<br>what he WANTED, even now. He wanted to sink down, down into the<br>muck where money does not rule. But this baby-business had upset<br>everything. It was a pretty banal predicament, after all. Private<br>vices, public virtues--the dilemma is as old as the world.<br><br>He looked up and saw that he was passing a public library. A<br>thought struck him. That baby. What did it mean, anyway, having a<br>baby? What was it that was actually happening to Rosemary at this<br>moment? He had only vague and general ideas of what pregnancy<br>meant. No doubt they would have books in there that would tell him<br>about it. He went in. The lending library was on the left. It<br>was there that you had to ask for works of reference.<br><br>The woman at the desk was a university graduate, young, colourless,<br>spectacled, and intensely disagreeable. She had a fixed suspicion<br>that no one--at least, no male person--ever consulted works of<br>reference except in search of pornography. As soon as you<br>approached she pierced you through and through with a flash of her<br>pince-nez and let you know that your dirty secret was no secret<br>from HER. After all, all works of reference are pornographical,<br>except perhaps Whitaker's Almanack. You can put even the Oxford<br>Dictionary to evil purposes by looking up words like ---- and ----.<br><br>Gordon knew her type at a glance, but he was too preoccupied to<br>care. 'Have you any book on gynaecology?' he said.<br><br>'Any WHAT?' demanded the young woman with a pince-nez flash of<br>unmistakable triumph. As usual! Another male in search of dirt!<br><br>'Well, any books on midwifery? About babies being born, and so<br>forth.'<br><br>'We don't issue books of that description to the general public,'<br>said the young woman frostily.<br><br>'I'm sorry--there's a point I particularly want to look up.'<br><br>'Are you a medical student?'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'Then I don't QUITE see what you want with books on midwifery.'<br><br>Curse the woman! Gordon thought. At another time he would have<br>been afraid of her; at present, however, she merely bored him.<br><br>'If you want to know, my wife's going to have a baby. We neither<br>of us know much about it. I want to see whether I can find out<br>anything useful.'<br><br>The young woman did not believe him. He looked too shabby and<br>worn, she decided, to be a newly married man. However, it was her<br>job to lend out books, and she seldom actually refused them, except<br>to children. You always got your book in the end, after you had<br>been made to feel yourself a dirty swine. With an aseptic air she<br>led Gordon to a small table in the middle of the library and<br>presented him with two fat books in brown covers. Thereafter she<br>left him alone, but kept an eye on him from whatever part of the<br>library she happened to be in. He could feel her pince-nez probing<br>the back of his neck at long range, trying to decide from his<br>demeanour whether he was really searching for information or merely<br>picking out the dirty bits.<br><br>He opened one of the books and searched inexpertly through it.<br>There were acres of close-printed text full of Latin words. That<br>was no use. He wanted something simple--pictures, for choice. How<br>long had this thing been going on? Six weeks--nine weeks, perhaps.<br>Ah! This must be it.<br><br>He came on a print of a nine weeks' foetus. It gave him a shock to<br>see it, for he had not expected it to look in the least like that.<br>It was a deformed, gnomelike thing, a sort of clumsy caricature of<br>a human being, with a huge domed head as big as the rest of its<br>body. In the middle of the great blank expanse of head there was a<br>tiny button of an ear. The thing was in profile; its boneless arm<br>was bent, and one hand, crude as a seal's flipper, covered its<br>face--fortunately, perhaps. Below were little skinny legs, twisted<br>like a monkey's with the toes turned in. It was a monstrous thing,<br>and yet strangely human. It surprised him that they should begin<br>looking human so soon. He had pictured something much more<br>rudimentary; a mere blob of nucleus, like a bubble of frog-spawn.<br>But it must be very tiny, of course. He looked at the dimensions<br>marked below. Length 30 millimetres. About the size of a large<br>gooseberry.<br><br>But perhaps it had not been going on quite so long as that. He<br>turned back a page or two and found a print of a six weeks' foetus.<br>A really dreadful thing this time--a thing he could hardly even<br>bear to look at. Strange that our beginnings and endings are so<br>ugly--the unborn as ugly as the dead. This thing looked as if it<br>were dead already. Its huge head, as though too heavy to hold<br>upright, was bent over at right angles at the place where its neck<br>ought to have been. There was nothing you could call a face, only<br>a wrinkle representing the eye--or was it the mouth? It had no<br>human resemblance this time; it was more like a dead puppy-dog.<br>Its short thick arms were very doglike, the hands being mere stumpy<br>paws. 15.5 millimetres long--no bigger than a hazel nut.<br><br>He pored for a long time over the two pictures. Their ugliness<br>made them more credible and therefore more moving. His baby had<br>seemed real to him from the moment when Rosemary spoke of abortion;<br>but it had been a reality without visual shape--something that<br>happened in the dark and was only important after it had happened.<br>But here was the actual process taking place. Here was the poor<br>ugly thing, no bigger than a gooseberry, that he had created by<br>his heedless act. Its future, its continued existence perhaps,<br>depended on him. Besides, it was a bit of himself--it WAS himself.<br>Dare one dodge such a responsibility as that?<br><br>But what about the alternative? He got up, handed over his books<br>to the disagreeable young woman, and went out; then, on an impulse,<br>turned back and went into the other part of the library, where the<br>periodicals were kept. The usual crowd of mangy-looking people<br>were dozing over the papers. There was one table set apart for<br>women's papers. He picked up one of them at random and bore it off<br>to another table.<br><br>It was an American paper of the more domestic kind, mainly adverts<br>with a few stories lurking apologetically among them. And WHAT<br>adverts! Quickly he flicked over the shiny pages. Lingerie,<br>jewellery, cosmetics, fur coats, silk stockings flicked up and down<br>like the figures in a child's peepshow. Page after page, advert<br>after advert. Lipsticks, undies, tinned food, patent medicines,<br>slimming cures, face-creams. A sort of cross-section of the money-<br>world. A panorama of ignorance, greed, vulgarity, snobbishness,<br>whoredom, and disease.<br><br>And THAT was the world they wanted him to re-enter. THAT was the<br>business in which he had a chance of Making Good. He flicked over<br>the pages more slowly. Flick, flick. Adorable--until she smiles.<br>The food that is shot out of a gun. Do you let foot-fag affect<br>your personality? Get back that peach-bloom on a Beautyrest<br>Mattress. Only a PENETRATING face-cream will reach that<br>undersurface dirt. Pink toothbrush is HER trouble. How to<br>alkalize your stomach almost instantly. Roughage for husky kids.<br>Are you one of the four out of five? The world-famed Culturequick<br>Scrapbook. Only a drummer and yet he quoted Dante.<br><br>Christ, what muck!<br><br>But of course it was an American paper. The Americans always go<br>one better on any kinds of beastliness, whether it is ice-cream<br>soda, racketeering, or theosophy. He went over to the women's<br>table and picked up another paper. An English one this time.<br>Perhaps the ads in an English paper wouldn't be quite so bad--<br>a little less brutally offensive?<br><br>He opened the paper. Flick, flick. Britons never shall be slaves!<br><br>Flick, flick. Get that waist-line back to normal! She SAID<br>'Thanks awfully for the lift,' but she THOUGHT, 'Poor boy, why<br>doesn't somebody tell him?' How a woman of thirty-two stole her<br>young man from a girl of twenty. Prompt relief for feeble kidneys.<br>Silkyseam--the smooth-sliding bathroom tissue. Asthma was choking<br>her! Are YOU ashamed of your undies? Kiddies clamour for their<br>Breakfast Crisps. Now I've a schoolgirl complexion all over. Hike<br>all day on a slab of Vitamalt!<br><br>To be mixed up in THAT! To be in it and of it--part and parcel of<br>it! God, God, God!<br><br>Presently he went out. The dreadful thing was that he knew already<br>what he was going to do. His mind was made up--had been made up<br>for a long time past. When this problem appeared it had brought<br>its solution with it; all his hesitation had been a kind of make-<br>believe. He felt as though some force outside himself were pushing<br>him. There was a telephone booth near by. Rosemary's hostel was<br>on the phone--she ought to be at home by now. He went into the<br>booth, feeling in his pocket. Yes, exactly two pennies. He<br>dropped them into the slot, swung the dial.<br><br>A refaned, adenoidal feminine voice answered him: 'Who's thyah,<br>please?'<br><br>He pressed Button A. So the die was cast.<br><br>'Is Miss Waterlow in?'<br><br>'Who's THYAH, please?'<br><br>'Say it's Mr Comstock. She'll know. Is she at home?'<br><br>'Ay'll see. Hold the lane, please.'<br><br>A pause.<br><br>'Hullo! Is that you, Gordon?'<br><br>'Hullo! Hullo! Is that you, Rosemary? I just wanted to tell you.<br>I've thought it over--I've made up my mind.'<br><br>'Oh!' There was another pause. With difficulty mastering her<br>voice, she added: 'Well, what did you decide?'<br><br>'It's all right. I'll take the job--if they'll give it me, that<br>is.'<br><br>'Oh, Gordon, I'm so glad! You're not angry with me? You don't<br>feel I've sort of bullied you into it?'<br><br>'No, it's all right. It's the only thing I can do. I've thought<br>everything out. I'll go up to the office and see them tomorrow.'<br><br>'I AM so glad!'<br><br>'Of course, I'm assuming they'll give me the job. But I suppose<br>they will, after what old Erskine said.'<br><br>'I'm sure they will. But, Gordon, there's just one thing. You<br>will go there nicely dressed, won't you? It might make a lot of<br>difference.'<br><br>'I know. I'll have to get my best suit out of pawn. Ravelston<br>will lend me the money.'<br><br>'Never mind about Ravelston. I'll lend you the money. I've got<br>four pounds put away. I'll run out and wire it you before the<br>post-office shuts. I expect you'll want some new shoes and a new<br>tie as well. And, oh, Gordon!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Wear a hat when you go up to the office, won't you? It looks<br>better, wearing a hat.'<br><br>'A hat! God! I haven't worn a hat for two years. Must I?'<br><br>'Well--it does look more business-like, doesn't it?'<br><br>'Oh, all right. A bowler hat, even, if you think I ought.'<br><br>'I think a soft hat would do. But get your hair cut, won't you,<br>there's a dear?'<br><br>'Yes, don't you worry. I'll be a smart young business man. Well<br>groomed, and all that.'<br><br>'Thanks ever so, Gordon dear. I must run out and wire that money.<br>Good night and good luck.'<br><br>'Good night.'<br><br>He came out of the booth. So that was that. He had torn it now,<br>right enough.<br><br>He walked rapidly away. What had he done? Chucked up the sponge!<br>Broken all his oaths! His long and lonely war had ended in<br>ignominious defeat. Circumcise ye your foreskins, saith the Lord.<br>He was coming back to the fold, repentant. He seemed to be walking<br>faster than usual. There was a peculiar sensation, an actual<br>physical sensation, in his heart, in his limbs, all over him. What<br>was it? Shame, misery, despair? Rage at being back in the clutch<br>of money? Boredom when he thought of the deadly future? He<br>dragged the sensation forth, faced it, examined it. It was relief.<br><br>Yes, that was the truth of it. Now that the thing was done he felt<br>nothing but relief; relief that now at last he had finished with<br>dirt, cold, hunger, and loneliness and could get back to decent,<br>fully human life. His resolutions, now that he had broken them,<br>seemed nothing but a frightful weight that he had cast off.<br>Moreover, he was aware that he was only fulfilling his destiny. In<br>some corner of his mind he had always known that this would happen.<br>He thought of the day when he had given them notice at the New<br>Albion; and Mr Erskine's kind, red, beefish face, gently counselling<br>him not to chuck up a 'good' job for nothing. How bitterly he had<br>sworn, then, that he was done with 'good' jobs for ever! Yet it was<br>foredoomed that he should come back, and he had known it even then.<br>And it was not merely because of Rosemary and the baby that he had<br>done it. That was the obvious cause, the precipitating cause, but<br>even without it the end would have been the same; if there had been<br>no baby to think about, something else would have forced his hand.<br>For it was what, in his secret heart, he had desired.<br><br>After all he did not lack vitality, and that moneyless existence to<br>which he had condemned himself had thrust him ruthlessly out of the<br>stream of life. He looked back over the last two frightful years.<br>He had blasphemed against money, rebelled against money, tried to<br>live like an anchorite outside the money-world; and it had brought<br>him not only misery, but also a frightful emptiness, an inescapable<br>sense of futility. To abjure money is to abjure life. Be not<br>righteous over much; why shouldst thou die before thy time? Now he<br>was back in the money-world, or soon would be. Tomorrow he would<br>go up to the New Albion, in his best suit and overcoat (he must<br>remember to get his overcoat out of pawn at the same time as his<br>suit), in homburg hat of the correct gutter-crawling pattern,<br>neatly shaved and with his hair cut short. He would be as though<br>born anew. The sluttish poet of today would be hardly recognizable<br>in the natty young business man of tomorrow. They would take him<br>back, right enough; he had the talent they needed. He would buckle<br>to work, sell his soul, and hold down his job.<br><br>And what about the future? Perhaps it would turn out that these<br>last two years had not left much mark upon him. They were merely a<br>gap, a small setback in his career. Quite quickly, now that he had<br>taken the first step, he would develop the cynical, blinkered<br>business mentality. He would forget his fine disgusts, cease to<br>rage against the tyranny of money--cease to be aware of it, even--<br>cease to squirm at the ads for Bovex and Breakfast Crisps. He<br>would sell his soul so utterly that he would forget it had ever<br>been his. He would get married, settle down, prosper moderately,<br>push a pram, have a villa and a radio and an aspidistra. He would<br>be a law-abiding little cit like any other law-abiding little cit--<br>a soldier in the strap-hanging army. Probably it was better so.<br><br>He slowed his pace a little. He was thirty and there was grey in<br>his hair, yet he had a queer feeling that he had only just grown<br>up. It occurred to him that he was merely repeating the destiny of<br>every human being. Everyone rebels against the money-code, and<br>everyone sooner or later surrenders. He had kept up his rebellion<br>a little longer than most, that was all. And he had made such a<br>wretched failure of it! He wondered whether every anchorite in his<br>dismal cell pines secretly to be back in the world of men. Perhaps<br>there were a few who did not. Somebody or other had said that the<br>modern world is only habitable by saints and scoundrels. He,<br>Gordon, wasn't a saint. Better, then, to be an unpretending<br>scoundrel along with the others. It was what he had secretly pined<br>for; now that he had acknowledged his desire and surrendered to it,<br>he was at peace.<br><br>He was making roughly in the direction of home. He looked up at<br>the houses he was passing. It was a street he did not know.<br>Oldish houses, mean-looking and rather dark, let off in flatlets<br>and single rooms for the most part. Railed areas, smoke-grimed<br>bricks, whited steps, dingy lace curtains. 'Apartments' cards in<br>half the windows, aspidistras in nearly all. A typical lower-<br>middle-class street. But not, on the whole, the kind of street<br>that he wanted to see blown to hell by bombs.<br><br>He wondered about the people in houses like those. They would be,<br>for example, small clerks, shop-assistants, commercial travellers,<br>insurance touts, tram conductors. Did THEY know that they were<br>only puppets dancing when money pulled the strings? You bet they<br>didn't. And if they did, what would they care? They were too busy<br>being born, being married, begetting, working, dying. It mightn't<br>be a bad thing, if you could manage it, to feel yourself one of<br>them, one of the ruck of men. Our civilization is founded on greed<br>and fear, but in the lives of common men the greed and fear are<br>mysteriously transmuted into something nobler. The lower-middle-<br>class people in there, behind their lace curtains, with their<br>children and their scraps of furniture and their aspidistras--they<br>lived by the money-code, sure enough, and yet they contrived to<br>keep their decency. The money-code as they interpreted it was not<br>merely cynical and hoggish. They had their standards, their<br>inviolable points of honour. They 'kept themselves respectable'--<br>kept the aspidistra flying. Besides, they were ALIVE. They were<br>bound up in the bundle of life. They begot children, which is what<br>the saints and the soul-savers never by any chance do.<br><br>The aspidistra is the tree of life, he thought suddenly.<br><br>He was aware of a lumpish weight in his inner pocket. It was the<br>manuscript of London Pleasures. He took it out and had a look at<br>it under a street lamp. A great wad of paper, soiled and tattered,<br>with that peculiar, nasty, grimed-at-the-edges look of papers which<br>have been a long time in one's pocket. About four hundred lines in<br>all. The sole fruit of his exile, a two years' foetus which would<br>never be born. Well, he had finished with all that. Poetry!<br>POETRY, indeed! In 1935.<br><br>What should he do with the manuscript? Best thing, shove it down<br>the W.C. But he was a long way from home and had not the necessary<br>penny. He halted by the iron grating of a drain. In the window of<br>the nearest house an aspidistra, a striped one, peeped between the<br>yellow lace curtains.<br><br>He unrolled a page of London Pleasures. In the middle of the<br>labyrinthine scrawlings a line caught his eye. Momentary regret<br>stabbed him. After all, parts of it weren't half bad! If only it<br>could ever be finished! It seemed such a shame to shy it away<br>after all the work he had done on it. Save it, perhaps? Keep it<br>by him and finish it secretly in his spare time? Even now it might<br>come to something.<br><br>No, no! Keep your parole. Either surrender or don't surrender.<br><br>He doubled up the manuscript and stuffed it between the bars of the<br>drain. It fell with a plop into the water below.<br><br>Vicisti, O aspidistra! <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/10.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/12.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
