<h2>Chapter 3</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">'Gordon Comstock' was a pretty bloody name, but then Gordon came<br>from a pretty bloody family. The 'Gordon' part of it was Scotch,<br>of course. The prevalence of such names nowadays is merely a part<br>of the Scotchification of England that has been going on these last<br>fifty years. 'Gordon', 'Colin', 'Malcolm', 'Donald'--these are the<br>gifts of Scotland to the world, along with golf, whisky, porridge,<br>and the works of Barrie and Stevenson.<br><br>The Comstocks belonged to the most dismal of all classes, the<br>middle-middle class, the landless gentry. In their miserable<br>poverty they had not even the snobbish consolation of regarding<br>themselves as an 'old' family fallen on evil days, for they were<br>not an 'old' family at all, merely one of those families which rose<br>on the wave of Victorian prosperity and then sank again faster than<br>the wave itself. They had had at most fifty years of comparative<br>wealth, corresponding with the lifetime of Gordon's grandfather,<br>Samuel Comstock--Gran'pa Comstock, as Gordon was taught to call<br>him, though the old man died four years before he was born.<br><br>Gran'pa Comstock was one of those people who even from the grave<br>exert a powerful influence. In life he was a tough old scoundrel.<br>He plundered the proletariat and the foreigner of fifty thousand<br>pounds, he built himself a red brick mansion as durable as a<br>pyramid, and he begot twelve children, of whom eleven survived.<br>Finally he died quite suddenly, of a cerebral haemorrhage. In<br>Kensal Green his children placed over him a monolith with the<br>following inscription:<br><br><br>IN EVER LOVING MEMORY OF<br><br>SAMUEL EZEKIEL COMSTOCK,<br><br>A FAITHFUL HUSBAND, A TENDER FATHER AND<br><br>AN UPRIGHT AND GODLY MAN,<br><br>WHO WAS BORN ON 9 JULY 1828, AND<br><br>DEPARTED THIS LIFE 5 SEPTEMBER 1901,<br><br>THIS STONE IS ERECTED BY<br><br>HIS SORROWING CHILDREN.<br><br>HE SLEEPS IN THE ARMS OF JESUS.<br><br><br>No need to repeat the blasphemous comments which everyone who had<br>known Gran'pa Comstock made on that last sentence. But it is worth<br>pointing out that the chunk of granite on which it was inscribed<br>weighed close on five tons and was quite certainly put there with<br>the intention, though not the conscious intention, of making sure<br>that Gran'pa Comstock shouldn't get up from underneath it. If you<br>want to know what a dead man's relatives really think of him, a<br>good rough test is the weight of his tombstone.<br><br>The Comstocks, as Gordon knew them, were a peculiarly dull, shabby,<br>dead-alive, ineffectual family. They lacked vitality to an extent<br>that was surprising. That was Gran'pa Comstock's doing, of course.<br>By the time when he died all his children were grown up and some of<br>them were middle-aged, and he had long ago succeeded in crushing<br>out of them any spirit they might ever have possessed. He had lain<br>upon them as a garden roller lies upon daisies, and there was no<br>chance of their flattened personalities ever expanding again. One<br>and all they turned out listless, gutless, unsuccessful sort of<br>people. None of the boys had proper professions, because Gran'pa<br>Comstock had been at the greatest pains to drive all of them into<br>professions for which they were totally unsuited. Only one of<br>them--John, Gordon's father--had even braved Gran'pa Comstock to<br>the extent of getting married during the latter's lifetime. It was<br>impossible to imagine any of them making any sort of mark in the<br>world, or creating anything, or destroying anything, or being<br>happy, or vividly unhappy, or fully alive, or even earning a decent<br>income. They just drifted along in an atmosphere of semi-genteel<br>failure. They were one of those depressing families, so common<br>among the middle-middle classes, in which NOTHING EVER HAPPENS.<br><br>From his earliest childhood Gordon's relatives had depressed him<br>horribly. When he was a little boy he still had great numbers of<br>uncles and aunts living. They were all more or less alike--grey,<br>shabby, joyless people, all rather sickly in health and all<br>perpetually harassed by money-worries which fizzled along without<br>ever reaching the sensational explosion of bankruptcy. It was<br>noticeable even then that they had lost all impulse to reproduce<br>themselves. Really vital people, whether they have money or<br>whether they haven't, multiply almost as automatically as animals.<br>Gran'pa Comstock, for instance, himself one of a litter of twelve,<br>had produced eleven progeny. Yet all those eleven produced only<br>two progeny between them, and those two--Gordon and his sister<br>Julia--had produced, by 1934, not even one. Gordon, last of the<br>Comstocks, was born in 1905, an unintended child; and thereafter,<br>in thirty long, long years, there was not a single birth in the<br>family, only deaths. And not only in the matter of marrying and<br>begetting, but in every possible way, NOTHING EVER HAPPENED in the<br>Comstock family. Every one of them seemed doomed, as though by a<br>curse, to a dismal, shabby, hole-and-corner existence. None of<br>them ever DID anything. They were the kind of people who in every<br>conceivable activity, even if it is only getting on to a bus, are<br>automatically elbowed away from the heart of things. All of them,<br>of course, were hopeless fools about money. Gran'pa Comstock had<br>finally divided his money among them more or less equally, so that<br>each received, after the sale of the red-brick mansion, round about<br>five thousand pounds. And no sooner was Gran'pa Comstock underground<br>than they began to fritter their money away. None of them had the<br>guts to lose it in sensational ways such as squandering it on women<br>or at the races; they simply dribbled it away and dribbled it away,<br>the women in silly investments and the men in futile little business<br>ventures that petered out after a year or two, leaving a net loss.<br>More than half of them went unmarried to their graves. Some of the<br>women did make rather undesirable middle-aged marriages after their<br>father was dead, but the men, because of their incapacity to earn a<br>proper living, were the kind who 'can't afford' to marry. None of<br>them, except Gordon's Aunt Angela, ever had so much as a home to<br>call their own; they were the kind of people who live in godless<br>'rooms' and tomb-like boarding-houses. And year after year they<br>died off and died off, of dingy but expensive little diseases that<br>swallowed up the last penny of their capital. One of the women,<br>Gordon's Aunt Charlotte, wandered off into the Mental Home at<br>Clapham in 1916. The Mental Homes of England, how chock-a-block<br>they stand! And it is above all derelict spinsters of the middle-<br>classes who keep them going. By 1934 only three of that generation<br>survived; Aunt Charlotte already mentioned, and Aunt Angela, who by<br>some happy chance had been induced to buy a house and a tiny annuity<br>in 1912, and Uncle Walter, who dingily existed on the few hundred<br>pounds that were left out of his five thousand and by running<br>short-lived 'agencies' for this and that.<br><br>Gordon grew up in the atmosphere of cut-down clothes and stewed<br>neck of mutton. His father, like the other Comstocks, was a<br>depressed and therefore depressing person, but he had some brains<br>and a slight literary turn. And seeing that his mind was of the<br>literary type and he had a shrinking horror of anything to do with<br>figures, it had seemed only natural to Gran'pa Comstock to make him<br>into a chartered accountant. So he practised, ineffectually, as a<br>chartered accountant, and was always buying his way into<br>partnerships which were dissolved after a year or two, and his<br>income fluctuated, sometimes rising to five hundred a year and<br>sometimes falling to two hundred, but always with a tendency to<br>decrease. He died in 1922, aged only fifty-six, but worn out--<br>he had suffered from a kidney disease for a long time past.<br><br>Since the Comstocks were genteel as well as shabby, it was<br>considered necessary to waste huge sums on Gordon's 'education'.<br>What a fearful thing it is, this incubus of 'education'! It means<br>that in order to send his son to the right kind of school (that is,<br>a public school or an imitation of one) a middle-class man is<br>obliged to live for years on end in a style that would be scorned<br>by a jobbing plumber. Gordon was sent to wretched, pretentious<br>schools whose fees were round about 120 pounds a year. Even these<br>fees, of course, meant fearful sacrifices at home. Meanwhile<br>Julia, who was five years older than he, received as nearly as<br>possible no education at all. She was, indeed, sent to one or two<br>poor, dingy little boarding schools, but she was 'taken away' for<br>good when she was sixteen. Gordon was 'the boy' and Julia was 'the<br>girl', and it seemed natural to everyone that 'the girl' should be<br>sacrificed to 'the boy'. Moreover, it had early been decided in<br>the family that Gordon was 'clever'. Gordon, with his wonderful<br>'cleverness', was to win scholarships, make a brilliant success in<br>life, and retrieve the family fortunes--that was the theory, and no<br>one believed in it more firmly than Julia. Julia was a tall,<br>ungainly girl, much taller than Gordon, with a thin face and a neck<br>just a little too long--one of those girls who even at their most<br>youthful remind one irresistibly of a goose. But her nature was<br>simple and affectionate. She was a self-effacing, home-keeping,<br>ironing, darning, and mending kind of girl, a natural spinster-<br>soul. Even at sixteen she had 'old maid' written all over her.<br>She idolized Gordon. All through his childhood she watched over<br>him, nursed him, spoiled him, went in rags so that he might have<br>the right clothes to go to school in, saved up her wretched pocket-<br>money to buy him Christmas presents and birthday presents. And of<br>course he repaid her, as soon as he was old enough, by despising<br>her because she was not pretty and not 'clever'.<br><br>Even at the third-rate schools to which Gordon was sent nearly all<br>the boys were richer than himself. They soon found out his<br>poverty, of course, and gave him hell because of it. Probably the<br>greatest cruelty one can inflict on a child is to send it to school<br>among children richer than itself. A child conscious of poverty<br>will suffer snobbish agonies such as a grown-up person can scarcely<br>imagine. In those days, especially at his preparatory school,<br>Gordon's life had been one long conspiracy to keep his end up and<br>pretend that his parents were richer than they were. Ah, the<br>humiliations of those days! That awful business, for instance,<br>at the beginning of each term, when you had to 'give in' to the<br>headmaster, publicly, the money you had brought back with you; and<br>the contemptuous, cruel sniggers from the other boys when you<br>didn't 'give in' ten bob or more. And the time when the others<br>found out that Gordon was wearing a ready-made suit which had cost<br>thirty-five shillings! The times that Gordon dreaded most of all<br>were when his parents came down to see him. Gordon, in those days<br>still a believer, used actually to pray that his parents wouldn't<br>come down to school. His father, especially, was the kind of<br>father you couldn't help being ashamed of; a cadaverous, despondent<br>man, with a bad stoop, his clothes dismally shabby and hopelessly<br>out of date. He carried about with him an atmosphere of failure,<br>worry, and boredom. And he had such a dreadful habit, when he was<br>saying good-bye, of tipping Gordon half a crown right in front of<br>the other boys, so that everyone could see that it was only half a<br>crown and not, as it ought to have been, ten bob! Even twenty<br>years afterwards the memory of that school made Gordon shudder.<br><br>The first effect of all this was to give him a crawling reverence<br>for money. In those days he actually hated his poverty-stricken<br>relatives--his father and mother, Julia, everybody. He hated them<br>for their dingy homes, their dowdiness, their joyless attitude to<br>life, their endless worrying and groaning over threepences and<br>sixpences. By far the commonest phrase in the Comstock household<br>was, 'We can't afford it.' In those days he longed for money as<br>only a child can long. Why SHOULDN'T one have decent clothes and<br>plenty of sweets and go to the pictures as often as one wanted to?<br>He blamed his parents for their poverty as though they had been<br>poor on purpose. Why couldn't they be like other boys' parents?<br>They PREFERRED being poor, it seemed to him. That is how a child's<br>mind works.<br><br>But as he grew older he grew--not less unreasonable, exactly, but<br>unreasonable in a different way. By this time he had found his<br>feet at school and was less violently oppressed. He never was very<br>successful at school--he did no work and won no scholarships--but<br>he managed to develop his brain along the lines that suited it. He<br>read the books which the headmaster denounced from the pulpit, and<br>developed unorthodox opinions about the C. of E., patriotism, and<br>the Old Boys' tie. Also he began writing poetry. He even, after a<br>year or two, began to send poems to the Athenaeum, the New Age, and<br>the Weekly Westminster; but they were invariably rejected. Of<br>course there were other boys of similar type with whom he<br>associated. Every public school has its small self-conscious<br>intelligentsia. And at that moment, in the years just after the<br>War, England was so full of revolutionary opinion that even the<br>public schools were infected by it. The young, even those who had<br>been too young to fight, were in a bad temper with their elders, as<br>well they might be; practically everyone with any brains at all was<br>for the moment a revolutionary. Meanwhile the old--those over<br>sixty, say--were running in circles like hens, squawking about<br>'subversive ideas'. Gordon and his friends had quite an exciting<br>time with their 'subversive ideas'. For a whole year they ran an<br>unofficial monthly paper called the Bolshevik, duplicated with a<br>jellygraph. It advocated Socialism, free love, the dismemberment<br>of the British Empire, the abolition of the Army and Navy, and so<br>on and so forth. It was great fun. Every intelligent boy of<br>sixteen is a Socialist. At that age one does not see the hook<br>sticking out of the rather stodgy bait.<br><br>In a crude, boyish way, he had begun to get the hang of this money-<br>business. At an earlier age than most people he grasped that ALL<br>modern commerce is a swindle. Curiously enough, it was the<br>advertisements in the Underground stations that first brought it<br>home to him. He little knew, as the biographers say, that he<br>himself would one day have a job in an advertising firm. But there<br>was more to it than the mere fact that business is a swindle. What<br>he realized, and more clearly as time went on, was that money-<br>worship has been elevated into a religion. Perhaps it is the only<br>real religion--the only really FELT religion--that is left to us.<br>Money is what God used to be. Good and evil have no meaning any<br>longer except failure and success. Hence the profoundly<br>significant phrase, to MAKE GOOD. The decalogue has been reduced<br>to two commandments. One for the employers--the elect, the money-<br>priesthood as it were--'Thou shalt make money'; the other for the<br>employed--the slaves and underlings--'Thou shalt not lose thy job.'<br>It was about this time that he came across The Ragged Trousered<br>Philanthropists and read about the starving carpenter who pawns<br>everything but sticks to his aspidistra. The aspidistra became a<br>sort of symbol for Gordon after that. The aspidistra, flower of<br>England! It ought to be on our coat of arms instead of the lion<br>and the unicorn. There will be no revolution in England while<br>there are aspidistras in the windows.<br><br>He did not hate and despise his relatives now--or not so much, at<br>any rate. They still depressed him greatly--those poor old<br>withering aunts and uncles, of whom two or three had already died,<br>his father, worn out and spiritless, his mother, faded, nervy, and<br>'delicate' (her lungs were none too strong), Julia, already, at<br>one-and-twenty, a dutiful, resigned drudge who worked twelve hours<br>a day and never had a decent frock. But he grasped now what was<br>the matter with them. It was not MERELY the lack of money. It was<br>rather that, having no money, they still lived mentally in the<br>money-world--the world in which money is virtue and poverty is<br>crime. It was not poverty but the down-dragging of RESPECTABLE<br>poverty that had done for them. They had accepted the money-code,<br>and by that code they were failures. They had never had the sense<br>to lash out and just LIVE, money or no money, as the lower classes<br>do. How right the lower classes are! Hats off to the factory lad<br>who with fourpence in the world puts his girl in the family way!<br>At least he's got blood and not money in his veins.<br><br>Gordon thought it all out, in the naive selfish manner of a boy.<br>There are two ways to live, he decided. You can be rich, or you<br>can deliberately refuse to be rich. You can possess money, or you<br>can despise money; the one fatal thing is to worship money and fail<br>to get it. He took it for granted that he himself would never be<br>able to make money. It hardly even occurred to him that he might<br>have talents which could be turned to account. That was what his<br>schoolmasters had done for him; they had rubbed it into him that he<br>was a seditious little nuisance and not likely to 'succeed' in<br>life. He accepted this. Very well, then, he would refuse the<br>whole business of 'succeeding'; he would make it his especial<br>purpose NOT to 'succeed'. Better to reign in hell than serve in<br>heaven; better to serve in hell than serve in heaven, for that<br>matter. Already, at sixteen, he knew which side he was on. He was<br>AGAINST the money-god and all his swinish priesthood. He had<br>declared war on money; but secretly, of course.<br><br>It was when he was seventeen that his father died, leaving about<br>two hundred pounds. Julia had been at work for some years now.<br>During 1918 and 1919 she had worked in a Government office, and<br>after that she took a course of cookery and got a job in a nasty,<br>ladylike little teashop near Earl's Court Underground Station. She<br>worked a seventy-two hour week and was given her lunch and tea and<br>twenty-five shillings; out of this she contributed twelve shillings<br>a week, often more, to the household expenses. Obviously the best<br>thing to do, now that Mr Comstock was dead, would have been to take<br>Gordon away from school, find him a job, and let Julia have the two<br>hundred pounds to set up a teashop of her own. But here the<br>habitual Comstock folly about money stepped in. Neither Julia nor<br>her mother would hear of Gordon leaving school. With the strange<br>idealistic snobbishness of the middle classes, they were willing to<br>go to the workhouse sooner than let Gordon leave school before the<br>statutory age of eighteen. The two hundred pounds, or more than<br>half of it, must be used in completing Gordon's 'education'.<br>Gordon let them do it. He had declared war on money but that did<br>not prevent him from being damnably selfish. Of course he dreaded<br>this business of going to work. What boy wouldn't dread it? Pen-<br>pushing in some filthy office--God! His uncles and aunts were<br>already talking dismally about 'getting Gordon settled in life'.<br>They saw everything in terms of 'good' jobs. Young Smith had got<br>such a 'good' job in a bank, and young Jones had got such a 'good'<br>job in an insurance office. It made him sick to hear them. They<br>seemed to want to see every young man in England nailed down in the<br>coffin of a 'good' job.<br><br>Meanwhile, money had got to be earned. Before her marriage<br>Gordon's mother had been a music teacher, and even since then she<br>had taken pupils, sporadically, when the family were in lower water<br>than usual. She now decided that she would start giving lessons<br>again. It was fairly easy to get pupils in the suburbs--they were<br>living in Acton--and with the music fees and Julia's contribution<br>they could probably 'manage' for the next year or two. But the<br>state of Mrs Comstock's lungs was now something more than<br>'delicate'. The doctor who had attended her husband before his<br>death had put his stethoscope to her chest and looked serious. He<br>had told her to take care of herself, keep warm, eat nourishing<br>food, and, above all, avoid fatigue. The fidgeting, tiring job of<br>giving piano lessons was, of course, the worst possible thing for<br>her. Gordon knew nothing of this. Julia knew, however. It was a<br>secret between the two women, carefully kept from Gordon.<br><br>A year went by. Gordon spent it rather miserably, more and more<br>embarrassed by his shabby clothes and lack of pocket-money, which<br>made girls an object of terror to him. However, the New Age<br>accepted one of his poems that year. Meanwhile, his mother sat on<br>comfortless piano stools in draughty drawing-rooms, giving lessons<br>at two shillings an hour. And then Gordon left school, and fat<br>interfering Uncle Walter, who had business connexions in a small<br>way, came forward and said that a friend of a friend of his could<br>get Gordon ever such a 'good' job in the accounts department of a<br>red lead firm. It was really a splendid job--a wonderful opening<br>for a young man. If Gordon buckled to work in the right spirit he<br>might be a Big Pot one of these days. Gordon's soul squirmed.<br>Suddenly, as weak people do, he stiffened, and, to the horror of<br>the whole family, refused even to try for the job.<br><br>There were fearful rows, of course. They could not understand him.<br>It seemed to them a kind of blasphemy to refuse such a 'good' job<br>when you got the chance of it. He kept reiterating that he didn't<br>want THAT KIND of job. Then what DID he want? they all demanded.<br>He wanted to 'write', he told them sullenly. But how could he<br>possibly make a living by 'writing'? they demanded again. And of<br>course he couldn't answer. At the back of his mind was the idea<br>that he could somehow live by writing poetry; but that was too<br>absurd even to be mentioned. But at any rate, he wasn't going into<br>business, into the money-world. He would have a job, but not a<br>'good' job. None of them had the vaguest idea what he meant. His<br>mother wept, even Julia 'went for' him, and all round him there<br>were uncles and aunts (he still had six or seven of them left)<br>feebly volleying and incompetently thundering. And after three<br>days a dreadful thing happened. In the middle of supper his mother<br>was seized by a violent fit of coughing, put her hand to her<br>breast, fell forward, and began bleeding at the mouth.<br><br>Gordon was terrified. His mother did not die, as it happened, but<br>she looked deathly as they carried her upstairs. Gordon rushed for<br>the doctor. For several days his mother lay at death's door. It<br>was the draughty drawing-rooms and the trudging to and fro in all<br>weathers that had done it. Gordon hung helplessly about the house,<br>a dreadful feeling of guilt mingling with his misery. He did not<br>exactly know but he half divined, that his mother had killed<br>herself in order to pay his school fees. After this he could not<br>go on opposing her any longer. He went to Uncle Walter and told<br>him that he would take that job in the red lead firm, if they would<br>give it him. So Uncle Walter spoke to his friend, and the friend<br>spoke to his friend, and Gordon was sent for and interviewed by an<br>old gentleman with badly fitting false teeth, and finally was given<br>a job, on probation. He started on twenty-five bob a week. And<br>with this firm he remained six years.<br><br>They moved away from Acton and took a flat in a desolate red block<br>of flats somewhere in the Paddington district. Mrs Comstock had<br>brought her piano, and when she had got some of her strength back<br>she gave occasional lessons. Gordon's wages were gradually raised,<br>and the three of them 'managed', more or less. It was Julia and<br>Mrs Comstock who did most of the 'managing'. Gordon still had a<br>boy's selfishness about money. At the office he got on not<br>absolutely badly. It was said of him that he was worth his wages<br>but wasn't the type that Makes Good. In a way the utter contempt<br>that he had for his work made things easier for him. He could put<br>up with this meaningless office-life, because he never for an<br>instant thought of it as permanent. Somehow, sometime, God knew<br>how or when, he was going to break free of it. After all, there<br>was always his 'writing'. Some day, perhaps, he might be able to<br>make a living of sorts by 'writing'; and you'd feel you were free<br>of the money-stink if you were a 'writer', would you not? The<br>types he saw all round him, especially the older men, made him<br>squirm. That was what it meant to worship the money-god! To<br>settle down, to Make Good, to sell your soul for a villa and an<br>aspidistra! To turn into the typical little bowler-hatted sneak--<br>Strube's 'little man'--the little docile cit who slips home by the<br>six-fifteen to a supper of cottage pie and stewed tinned pears,<br>half an hour's listening-in to the B. B. C. Symphony Concert, and<br>then perhaps a spot of licit sexual intercourse if his wife 'feels<br>in the mood'! What a fate! No, it isn't like that that one was<br>meant to live. One's got to get right out of it, out of the money-<br>stink. It was a kind of plot that he was nursing. He was as<br>though dedicated to this war against money. But it was still a<br>secret. The people at the office never suspected him of unorthodox<br>ideas. They never even found out that he wrote poetry--not that<br>there was much to find out, for in six years he had less than<br>twenty poems printed in the magazines. To look at, he was just the<br>same as any other City clerk--just a soldier in the strap-hanging<br>army that sways eastward at morning, westward at night in the<br>carriages of the Underground.<br><br>He was twenty-four when his mother died. The family was breaking<br>up. Only four of the older generation of Comstocks were left now--<br>Aunt Angela, Aunt Charlotte, Uncle Walter, and another uncle who<br>died a year later. Gordon and Julia gave up the flat. Gordon took<br>a furnished room in Doughty Street (he felt vaguely literary,<br>living in Bloomsbury), and Julia moved to Earl's Court, to be near<br>the shop. Julia was nearly thirty now, and looked much older. She<br>was thinner than ever, though healthy enough, and there was grey in<br>her hair. She still worked twelve hours a day, and in six years<br>her wages had only risen by ten shillings a week. The horribly<br>ladylike lady who kept the teashop was a semi-friend as well as an<br>employer, and thus could sweat and bully Julia to the tune of<br>'dearest' and 'darling'. Four months after his mother's death<br>Gordon suddenly walked out of his job. He gave the firm no<br>reasons. They imagined that he was going to 'better himself', and--<br>luckily, as it turned out--gave him quite good references. He had<br>not even thought of looking for another job. He wanted to burn his<br>boats. From now on he would breathe free air, free of the money-<br>stink. He had not consciously waited for his mother to die before<br>doing this; still, it was his mother's death that had nerved him to<br>it.<br><br>Of course there was another and more desolating row in what was<br>left of the family. They thought Gordon must have gone mad. Over<br>and over again he tried, quite vainly, to explain to them why he<br>would not yield himself to the servitude of a 'good' job. 'But<br>what are you going to live on? What are you going to live on?' was<br>what they all wailed at him. He refused to think seriously about<br>it. Of course, he still harboured the notion that he could make a<br>living of sorts by 'writing'. By this time he had got to know<br>Ravelston, editor of Antichrist, and Ravelston, besides printing<br>his poems, managed to get him books to review occasionally. His<br>literary prospects were not so bleak as they had been six years<br>ago. But still, it was not the desire to 'write' that was his real<br>motive. To get out of the money-world--that was what he wanted.<br>Vaguely he looked forward to some kind of moneyless, anchorite<br>existence. He had a feeling that if you genuinely despise money<br>you can keep going somehow, like the birds of the air. He forgot<br>that the birds of the air don't pay room-rent. The poet starving<br>in a garret--but starving, somehow, not uncomfortably--that was his<br>vision of himself.<br><br>The next seven months were devastating. They scared him and almost<br>broke his spirit. He learned what it means to live for weeks on<br>end on bread and margarine, to try to 'write' when you are half<br>starved, to pawn your clothes, to sneak trembling up the stairs<br>when you owe three weeks' rent and your landlady is listening for<br>you. Moreover, in those seven months he wrote practically nothing.<br>The first effect of poverty is that it kills thought. He grasped,<br>as though it were a new discovery, that you do not escape from<br>money merely by being moneyless. On the contrary, you are the<br>hopeless slave of money until you have enough of it to live on--a<br>'competence', as the beastly middle-class phrase goes. Finally he<br>was turned out of his room, after a vulgar row. He was three days<br>and four nights in the street. It was bloody. Three mornings, on<br>the advice of another man he met on the Embankment, he spent in<br>Billingsgate, helping to shove fish-barrows up the twisty little<br>hills from Billingsgate into Eastcheap. 'Twopence an up' was what<br>you got, and the work knocked hell out of your thigh muscles.<br>There were crowds of people on the same job, and you had to wait<br>your turn; you were lucky if you made eighteen-pence between four<br>in the morning and nine. After three days of it Gordon gave up.<br>What was the use? He was beaten. There was nothing for it but to<br>go back to his family, borrow some money, and find another job.<br><br>But now, of course, there was no job to be had. For months he<br>lived by cadging on the family. Julia kept him going till the last<br>penny of her tiny savings was gone. It was abominable. Here was<br>the outcome of all his fine attitudes! He had renounced ambition,<br>made war on money, and all it led to was cadging from his sister!<br>And Julia, he knew, felt his failure far more than she felt the<br>loss of her savings. She had had such hopes of Gordon. He alone<br>of all the Comstocks had had it in him to 'succeed'. Even now she<br>believed that somehow, some day, he was going to retrieve the<br>family fortunes. He was so 'clever'--surely he could make money if<br>he tried! For two whole months Gordon stayed with Aunt Angela in<br>her little house at Highgate--poor, faded, mummified Aunt Angela,<br>who even for herself had barely enough to eat. All this time he<br>searched desperately for work. Uncle Walter could not help him.<br>His influence in the business world, never large, was now<br>practically nil. At last, however, in a quite unexpected way, the<br>luck turned. A friend of a friend of Julia's employer's brother<br>managed to get Gordon a job in the accounts department of the New<br>Albion Publicity Company.<br><br>The New Albion was one of those publicity firms which have sprung<br>up everywhere since the War--the fungi, as you might say, that<br>sprout from a decaying capitalism. It was a smallish rising firm<br>and took every class of publicity it could get. It designed a<br>certain number of large-scale posters for oatmeal stout, self-<br>raising flour, and so forth, but its main line was millinery and<br>cosmetic advertisements in the women's illustrated papers, besides<br>minor ads in twopenny weeklies, such as Whiterose Pills for Female<br>Disorders, Your Horoscope Cast by Professor Raratongo, The Seven<br>Secrets of Venus, New Hope for the Ruptured, Earn Five Pounds a<br>Week in your Spare Time, and Cyprolax Hair Lotion Banishes all<br>Unpleasant Intruders. There was a large staff of commercial<br>artists, of course. It was here that Gordon first made the<br>acquaintance of Rosemary. She was in the 'studio' and helped to<br>design fashion plates. It was a long time before he actually spoke<br>to her. At first he knew her merely as a remote personage, small,<br>dark, with swift movements, distinctly attractive but rather<br>intimidating. When they passed one another in the corridors she<br>eyed him ironically, as though she knew all about him and<br>considered him a bit of a joke; nevertheless she seemed to look at<br>him a little oftener than was necessary. He had nothing to do with<br>her side of the business. He was in the accounts department, a<br>mere clerk on three quid a week.<br><br>The interesting thing about the New Albion was that it was so<br>completely modern in spirit. There was hardly a soul in the firm<br>who was not perfectly well aware that publicity--advertising--is<br>the dirtiest ramp that capitalism has yet produced. In the red<br>lead firm there had still lingered certain notions of commercial<br>honour and usefulness. But such things would have been laughed at<br>in the New Albion. Most of the employees were the hard-boiled,<br>Americanized, go-getting type to whom nothing in the world is<br>sacred, except money. They had their cynical code worked out. The<br>public are swine; advertising is the rattling of a stick inside a<br>swill-bucket. And yet beneath their cynicism there was the final<br>naivete, the blind worship of the money-god. Gordon studied them<br>unobtrusively. As before, he did his work passably well and his<br>fellow-employees looked down on him. Nothing had changed in his<br>inner mind. He still despised and repudiated the money-code.<br>Somehow, sooner or later, he was going to escape from it; even now,<br>after his first fiasco, he still plotted to escape. He was IN the<br>money world, but not OF it. As for the types about him, the little<br>bowler-hatted worms who never turned, and the go-getters, the<br>American business-college gutter-crawlers, they rather amused him<br>than not. He liked studying their slavish keep-your-job mentality.<br>He was the chiel amang them takin' notes.<br><br>One day a curious thing happened. Somebody chanced to see a poem<br>of Gordon's in a magazine, and put it about that they 'had a poet<br>in the office'. Of course Gordon was laughed at, not ill-<br>naturedly, by the other clerks. They nicknamed him 'the bard' from<br>that day forth. But though amused, they were also faintly<br>contemptuous. It confirmed all their ideas about Gordon. A fellow<br>who wrote poetry wasn't exactly the type to Make Good. But the<br>thing had an unexpected sequel. About the time when the clerks<br>grew tired of chaffing Gordon, Mr Erskine, the managing director,<br>who had hitherto taken only the minimum notice of him, sent for him<br>and interviewed him.<br><br>Mr Erskine was a large, slow-moving man with a broad, healthy,<br>expressionless face. From his appearance and the slowness of his<br>speech you would have guessed with confidence that he had something<br>to do with either agriculture or cattle-breeding. His wits were as<br>slow as his movements, and he was the kind of man who never hears<br>of anything until everybody else has stopped talking about it. How<br>such a man came to be in charge of an advertising agency, only the<br>strange gods of capitalism know. But he was quite a likeable<br>person. He had not that sniffish, buttoned-up spirit that usually<br>goes with an ability to make money. And in a way his fat-<br>wittedness stood him in good stead. Being insensible to popular<br>prejudice, he could assess people on their merits; consequently, he<br>was rather good at choosing talented employees. The news that<br>Gordon had written poems, so far from shocking him, vaguely<br>impressed him. They wanted literary talents in the New Albion.<br>Having sent for Gordon, he studied him in a somnolent, sidelong way<br>and asked him a number of inconclusive questions. He never<br>listened to Gordon's answers, but punctuated his questions with a<br>noise that sounded like 'Hm, hm, hm.' Wrote poetry, did he? Oh<br>yes? Hm. And had it printed in the papers? Hm, hm. Suppose they<br>paid you for that kind of thing? Not much, eh? No, suppose not.<br>Hm, hm. Poetry? Hm. A bit difficult, that must be. Getting the<br>lines the same length, and all that. Hm, hm. Write anything else?<br>Stories, and so forth? Hm. Oh yes? Very interesting. Hm!<br><br>Then, without further questions, he promoted Gordon to a special<br>post as secretary--in effect, apprentice--to Mr Clew, the New<br>Albion's head copywriter. Like every other advertising agency, the<br>New Albion was constantly in search of copywriters with a touch of<br>imagination. It is a curious fact, but it is much easier to find<br>competent draughtsmen than to find people who can think of slogans<br>like 'Q. T. Sauce keeps Hubby Smiling' and 'Kiddies clamour for<br>their Breakfast Crisps'. Gordon's wages were not raised for the<br>moment, but the firm had their eye on him. With luck he might be a<br>full-fledged copywriter in a year's time. It was an unmistakable<br>chance to Make Good.<br><br>For six months he was working with Mr Clew. Mr Clew was a harassed<br>man of about forty, with wiry hair into which he often plunged his<br>fingers. He worked in a stuffy little office whose walls were<br>entirely papered with his past triumphs in the form of posters. He<br>took Gordon under his wing in a friendly way, showed him the ropes,<br>and was even ready to listen to his suggestions. At that time they<br>were working on a line of magazine ads for April Dew, the great new<br>deodorant which the Queen of Sheba Toilet Requisites Co. (this was<br>Flaxman's firm, curiously enough) were putting on the market.<br>Gordon started on the job with secret loathing. But now there was<br>a quite unexpected development. It was that Gordon showed, almost<br>from the start, a remarkable talent for copywriting. He could<br>compose an ad as though he had been born to it. The vivid phrase<br>that sticks and rankles, the neat little para. that packs a world<br>of lies into a hundred words--they came to him almost unsought. He<br>had always had a gift for words, but this was the first time he had<br>used it successfully. Mr Clew thought him very promising. Gordon<br>watched his own development, first with surprise, then with<br>amusement, and finally with a kind of horror. THIS, then, was what<br>he was coming to! Writing lies to tickle the money out of fools'<br>pockets! There was a beastly irony, too, in the fact that he, who<br>wanted to be a 'writer', should score his sole success in writing<br>ads for deodorants. However, that was less unusual than he<br>imagined. Most copywriters, they say, are novelists manques; or is<br>it the other way about?<br><br>The Queen of Sheba were very pleased with their ads. Mr Erskine<br>also was pleased. Gordon's wages were raised by ten shillings a<br>week. And it was now that Gordon grew frightened. Money was<br>getting him after all. He was sliding down, down, into the money-<br>sty. A little more and he would be stuck in it for life. It is<br>queer how these things happen. You set your face against success,<br>you swear never to Make Good--you honestly believe that you<br>couldn't Make Good even if you wanted to; and then something<br>happens along, some mere chance, and you find yourself Making Good<br>almost automatically. He saw that now or never was the time to<br>escape. He had got to get out of it--out of the money-world,<br>irrevocably, before he was too far involved.<br><br>But this time he wasn't going to be starved into submission. He<br>went to Ravelston and asked his help. He told him that he wanted<br>some kind of job; not a 'good' job, but a job that would keep his<br>body without wholly buying his soul. Ravelston understood<br>perfectly. The distinction between a job and a 'good' job did not<br>have to be explained to him; nor did he point out to Gordon the<br>folly of what he was doing. That was the great thing about<br>Ravelston. He could always see another person's point of view. It<br>was having money that did it, no doubt; for the rich can afford to<br>be intelligent. Moreover, being rich himself, he could find jobs<br>for other people. After only a fortnight he told Gordon of<br>something that might suit him. A Mr McKechnie, a rather<br>dilapidated second-hand bookseller with whom Ravelston dealt<br>occasionally, was looking for an assistant. He did not want a<br>trained assistant who would expect full wages; he wanted somebody<br>who looked like a gentleman and could talk about books--somebody to<br>impress the more bookish customers. It was the very reverse of a<br>'good' job. The hours were long, the pay was wretched--two pounds<br>a week--and there was no chance of advancement. It was a blind-<br>alley job. And, of course, a blind-alley job was the very thing<br>Gordon was looking for. He went and saw Mr McKechnie, a sleepy,<br>benign old Scotchman with a red nose and a white beard stained by<br>snuff, and was taken on without demur. At this time, too, his<br>volume of poems, Mice, was going to press. The seventh publisher<br>to whom he had sent it had accepted it. Gordon did not know that<br>this was Ravelston's doing. Ravelston was a personal friend of the<br>publisher. He was always arranging this kind of thing, stealthily,<br>for obscure poets. Gordon thought the future was opening before<br>him. He was a made man--or, by Smilesian, aspidistral standards,<br>UNmade.<br><br>He gave a month's notice at the office. It was a painful business<br>altogether. Julia, of course, was more distressed than ever at<br>this second abandonment of a 'good' job. By this time Gordon had<br>got to know Rosemary. She did not try to prevent him from throwing<br>up his job. It was against her code to interfere--'You've got to<br>live your own life,' was always her attitude. But she did not in<br>the least understand why he was doing it. The thing that most<br>upset him, curiously enough, was his interview with Mr Erskine. Mr<br>Erskine was genuinely kind. He did not want Gordon to leave the<br>firm, and said so frankly. With a sort of elephantine politeness<br>he refrained from calling Gordon a young fool. He did, however,<br>ask him why he was leaving. Somehow, Gordon could not bring<br>himself to avoid answering or to say--the only thing Mr Erskine<br>would have understood--that he was going after a better-paid job.<br>He blurted out shamefacedly that he 'didn't think business suited<br>him' and that he 'wanted to go in for writing'. Mr Erskine was<br>noncommittal. Writing, eh? Hm. Much money in that sort of thing<br>nowadays? Not much, eh? Hm. No, suppose not. Hm. Gordon,<br>feeling and looking ridiculous, mumbled that he had 'got a book<br>just coming out'. A book of poems, he added with difficulty in<br>pronouncing the word. Mr Erskine regarded him sidelong before<br>remarking:<br><br>'Poetry, eh? Hm. Poetry? Make a living out of that sort of<br>thing, do you think?'<br><br>'Well--not a living, exactly. But it would help.'<br><br>'Hm--well! You know best, I expect. If you want a job any time,<br>come back to us. I dare say we could find room for you. We can do<br>with your sort here. Don't forget.'<br><br>Gordon left with a hateful feeling of having behaved perversely and<br>ungratefully. But he had got to do it; he had got to get out of<br>the money-world. It was queer. All over England young men were<br>eating their hearts out for lack of jobs, and here was he, Gordon,<br>to whom the very word 'job' was faintly nauseous, having jobs<br>thrust unwanted upon him. It was an example of the fact that you<br>can get anything in this world if you genuinely don't want it.<br>Moreover, Mr Erskine's words stuck in his mind. Probably he had<br>meant what he said. Probably there WOULD be a job waiting for<br>Gordon if he chose to go back. So his boats were only half burned.<br>The New Albion was a doom before him as well as behind.<br><br>But how happy had he been, just at first, in Mr McKechnie's<br>bookshop! For a little while--a very little while--he had the<br>illusion of being really out of the money-world. Of course the<br>book-trade was a swindle, like all other trades; but how different<br>a swindle! Here was no hustling and Making Good, no gutter-<br>crawling. No go-getter could put up for ten minutes with the<br>stagnant air of the book-trade. As for the work, it was very<br>simple. It was mainly a question of being in the shop ten hours a<br>day. Mr McKechnie wasn't a bad old stick. He was a Scotchman, of<br>course, but Scottish is as Scottish does. At any rate he was<br>reasonably free from avarice--his most distinctive trait seemed to<br>be laziness. He was also a teetotaller and belonged to some<br>Nonconformist sect or other, but this did not affect Gordon.<br>Gordon had been at the shop about a month when Mice was published.<br>No less than thirteen papers reviewed it! And The Times Lit. Supp.<br>said that it showed 'exceptional promise'. It was not till months<br>later that he realized what a hopeless failure Mice had really<br>been.<br><br>And it was only now, when he was down to two quid a week and had<br>practically cut himself off from the prospect of earning more, that<br>he grasped the real nature of the battle he was fighting. The<br>devil of it is that the glow of renunciation never lasts. Life on<br>two quid a week ceases to be a heroic gesture and becomes a dingy<br>habit. Failure is as great a swindle as success. He had thrown up<br>his 'good' job and renounced 'good' jobs for ever. Well, that was<br>necessary. He did not want to go back on it. But it was no use<br>pretending that because his poverty was self-imposed he had escaped<br>the ills that poverty drags in its train. It was not a question of<br>hardship. You don't suffer real physical hardship on two quid a<br>week, and if you did it wouldn't matter. It is in the brain and<br>the soul that lack of money damages you. Mental deadness,<br>spiritual squalor--they seem to descend upon you inescapably when<br>your income drops below a certain point. Faith, hope, money--only<br>a saint could have the first two without having the third.<br><br>He was growing more mature. Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-<br>nine. He had reached the age when the future ceases to be a rosy<br>blur and becomes actual and menacing. The spectacle of his<br>surviving relatives depressed him more and more. As he grew older<br>he felt himself more akin to them. That was the way he was going!<br>A few years more, and he would be like that, just like that! He<br>felt this even with Julia, whom he saw oftener than his uncle and<br>aunt. In spite of various resolves never to do it again, he still<br>borrowed money off Julia periodically. Julia's hair was greying<br>fast; there was a deep line scored down each of her thin red<br>cheeks. She had settled her life into a routine in which she was<br>not unhappy. There was her work at the shop, her 'sewing' at<br>nights in her Earl's Court bed-sitting-room (second floor, back,<br>nine bob a week unfurnished), her occasional forgatherings with<br>spinster friends as lonely as herself. It was the typical<br>submerged life of the penniless unmarried woman; she accepted it,<br>hardly realizing that her destiny could ever have been different.<br>Yet in her way she suffered, more for Gordon than for herself. The<br>gradual decay of the family, the way they had died off and died off<br>and left nothing behind, was a sort of tragedy in her mind. Money,<br>money! 'None of us ever seems to make any money!' was her<br>perpetual lament. And of them all, Gordon alone had had the chance<br>to make money; and Gordon had chosen not to. He was sinking<br>effortless into the same rut of poverty as the others. After the<br>first row was over, she was too decent to 'go for' him again<br>because he had thrown up his job at the New Albion. But his<br>motives were quite meaningless to her. In her wordless feminine<br>way she knew that the sin against money is the ultimate sin.<br><br>And as for Aunt Angela and Uncle Walter--oh dear, oh dear! What a<br>couple! It made Gordon feel ten years older every time he looked<br>at them.<br><br>Uncle Walter, for example. Uncle Walter was very depressing. He<br>was sixty-seven, and what with his various 'agencies' and the<br>dwindling remnants of his patrimony his income might have been<br>nearly three pounds a week. He had a tiny little cabin of an<br>office off Cursitor Street, and he lived in a very cheap boarding-<br>house in Holland Park. That was quite according to precedent; all<br>the Comstock men drifted naturally into boarding-houses. When you<br>looked at poor old uncle, with his large tremulous belly, his<br>bronchitic voice, his broad, pale, timidly pompous face, rather<br>like Sargent' s portrait of Henry James, his entirely hairless<br>head, his pale, pouchy eyes, and his ever-drooping moustache, to<br>which he tried vainly to give an upward twirl--when you looked at<br>him, you found it totally impossible to believe that he had ever<br>been young. Was it conceivable that such a being had ever felt<br>life tingle in his veins? Had he ever climbed a tree, taken a<br>header off a springboard, or been in love? Had he ever had a brain<br>in working order? Even back in the early nineties, when he was<br>arithmetically young, had he ever made any kind of stab at life? A<br>few furtive half-hearted frolics, perhaps. A few whiskies in dull<br>bars, a visit or two to the Empire promenade, a little whoring on<br>the Q. T.; the sort of dingy, drabby fornications that you can<br>imagine happening between Egyptian mummies after the museum is<br>closed for the night. And after that the long, long quiet years of<br>business failure, loneliness, and stagnation in godless boarding-<br>houses.<br><br>And yet uncle in his old age was probably not unhappy. He had one<br>hobby of never-failing interest, and that was his diseases. He<br>suffered, by his own account, from every disease in the medical<br>dictionary, and was never weary of talking about them. Indeed, it<br>seemed to Gordon that none of the people in his uncle's boarding-<br>house--he had been there occasionally--ever did talk about anything<br>except their diseases. All over the darkish drawing-room, ageing,<br>discoloured people sat about in couples, discussing symptoms.<br>Their conversation was like the dripping of stalactite to<br>stalagmite. Drip, drip. 'How is your lumbago?' says stalactite to<br>stalagmite. 'I find my Kruschen Salts are doing me good,' says<br>stalagmite to stalactite. Drip, drip, drip.<br><br>And then there was Aunt Angela, aged sixty-nine. Gordon tried not<br>even to think of Aunt Angela oftener than he could help.<br><br>Poor, dear, good, kind, depressing Aunt Angela!<br><br>Poor, shrivelled, parchment-yellow, skin-and-bone Aunt Angela!<br>There in her miserable little semi-detached house in Highgate--<br>Briarbrae, its name was--there in her palace in the northern<br>mountains, there dwelleth she, Angela the Ever-virgin, of whom no<br>man either living or among the shades can say truly that upon her<br>lips he hath pressed the dear caresses of a lover. All alone she<br>dwelleth, and all day long she fareth to and fro, and in her hand<br>is the feather-mop fashioned from the tail feathers of the<br>contumacious turkey, and with it she polisheth the dark-leaved<br>aspidistras and flicketh the hated dust from the resplendent never-<br>to-be-used Crown Derby china tea-service. And ever and anon she<br>comforteth her dear heart with draughts of the dark brown tea, both<br>Flowery Orange and Pekoe Points, which the small-bearded sons of<br>Coromandel have ferried to her across the wine-dark sea. Poor,<br>dear, good, kind, but on the whole unloveable Aunt Angela! Her<br>annuity was ninety-eight pounds a year (thirty-eight bob a week,<br>but she retained a middle-class habit of thinking of her income as<br>a yearly and not weekly thing), and out of that, twelve and<br>sixpence a week went on house rates. She would probably have<br>starved occasionally if Julia had not smuggled her packets of cakes<br>and bread and butter from the shop--always, of course, presented as<br>'Just a few little things that it seemed a pity to throw away',<br>with the solemn pretence that Aunt Angela didn't really need them.<br><br>Yet she too had her pleasures, poor old aunty. She had become a<br>great novel-reader in her old age, the public library being only<br>ten minutes' walk from Briarbrae. During his lifetime, on some<br>whim or other, Gran'pa Comstock had forbidden his daughters to read<br>novels. Consequently, having only begun to read novels in 1902,<br>Aunt Angela was always a couple of decades behind the current mode<br>in fiction. But she plodded along in the rear, faint yet pursuing.<br>In the nineteen-hundreds she was still reading Rhoda Broughton and<br>Mrs Henry Wood. In the War years she discovered Hall Caine and Mrs<br>Humphry Ward. In the nineteen-twenties she was reading Silas<br>Hocking and H. Seton Merriman, and by the nineteen-thirties she had<br>almost, but not quite, caught up with W. B. Maxwell and William J.<br>Locke. Further she would never get. As for the post-War<br>novelists, she had heard of them afar off, with their immorality<br>and their blasphemies and their devastating 'cleverness'. But she<br>would never live to read them. Walpole we know, and Hichens we<br>read, but Hemingway, who are you?<br><br>Well, this was 1934, and that was what was left of the Comstock<br>family. Uncle Walter, with his 'agencies' and his diseases. Aunt<br>Angela, dusting the Crown Derby china tea-service in Briarbrae.<br>Aunt Charlotte, still preserving a vague vegetable existence in the<br>Mental Home. Julia, working a seventy-two-hour week and doing her<br>'sewing' at nights by the tiny gas-fire in her bedsitting-room.<br>Gordon, nearly thirty, earning two quid a week in a fool's job, and<br>struggling, as the sole demonstrable object of his existence, with<br>a dreadful book that never got any further.<br><br>Possibly there were some other, more distantly related Comstocks,<br>for Gran'pa Comstock had been one of a family of twelve. But if<br>any survived they had grown rich and lost touch with their poor<br>relations; for money is thicker than blood. As for Gordon's branch<br>of the family, the combined income of the five of them, allowing<br>for the lump sum that had been paid down when Aunt Charlotte<br>entered the Mental Home, might have been six hundred a year. Their<br>combined ages were two hundred and sixty-three years. None of them<br>had ever been out of England, fought in a war, been in prison,<br>ridden a horse, travelled in an aeroplane, got married, or given<br>birth to a child. There seemed no reason why they should not<br>continue in the same style until they died. Year in, year out,<br>NOTHING EVER HAPPENED in the Comstock family. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/2.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/4.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
