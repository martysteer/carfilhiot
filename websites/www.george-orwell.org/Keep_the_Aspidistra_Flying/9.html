<h2>Chapter 9</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">And, by Jove, tomorrow we WERE sober!<br><br>Gordon emerged from some long, sickly dream to the consciousness<br>that the books in the lending library were the wrong way up. They<br>were all lying on their sides. Moreover, for some reason their<br>backs had turned white--white and shiny, like porcelain.<br><br>He opened his eyes a little wider and moved an arm. Small rivulets<br>of pain, seemingly touched off by the movement, shot through his<br>body at unexpected places--down the calves of his legs, for<br>instance, and up both sides of his head. He perceived that he was<br>lying on his side, with a hard smooth pillow under his cheek and a<br>coarse blanket scratching his chin and pushing its hairs into his<br>mouth. Apart from the minor pains that stabbed him every time he<br>moved, there was a large, dull sort of pain which was not localized<br>but which seemed to hover all over him.<br><br>Suddenly he flung off the blanket and sat up. He was in a police<br>cell. At this moment a frightful spasm of nausea overcame him.<br>Dimly perceiving a W.C. in the corner, he crept towards it and was<br>violently sick, three or four times.<br><br>After that, for several minutes, he was in agonizing pain. He<br>could scarcely stand on his feet, his head throbbed as though it<br>were going to burst, and the light seemed like some scalding white<br>liquid pouring into his brain through the sockets of his eyes. He<br>sat on the bed holding his head between his hands. Presently, when<br>some of the throbbing had died down, he had another look about him.<br>The cell measured about twelve feet long by six wide and was very<br>high. The walls were all of white porcelain bricks, horribly white<br>and clean. He wondered dully how they cleaned as high up as the<br>ceiling. Perhaps with a hose, he reflected. At one end there was<br>a little barred window, very high up, and at the other end, over<br>the door, an electric bulb let into the wall and protected by a<br>stout grating. The thing he was sitting on was not actually a bed,<br>but a shelf with one blanket and a canvas pillow. The door was of<br>steel, painted green. In the door there was a little round hole<br>with a flap on the outside.<br><br>Having seen this much he lay down and pulled the blanket over him<br>again. He had no further curiosity about his surroundings. As to<br>what had happened last night, he remembered everything--at least,<br>he remembered everything up to the time when he had gone with Dora<br>into the room with the aspidistra. God knew what had happened<br>after that. There had been some kind of bust-up and he had landed<br>in the clink. He had no notion of what he had done; it might be<br>murder for all he knew. In any case he did not care. He turned<br>his face to the wall and pulled the blanket over his head to shut<br>out the light.<br><br>After a long time the spyhole in the door was pushed aside. Gordon<br>managed to turn his head round. His neck-muscles seemed to creak.<br>Through the spyhole he could see a blue eye and a semi-circle of<br>pink chubby cheek.<br><br>''Ja do with a cup of tea?' a voice said.<br><br>Gordon sat up and instantly felt very sick again. He took his head<br>between his hands and groaned. The thought of a cup of hot tea<br>appealed to him, but he knew it would make him sick if it had sugar<br>in it.<br><br>'Please,' he said.<br><br>The police constable opened a partition in the top half of the door<br>and passed in a thick white mug of tea. It had sugar in it. The<br>constable was a solid rosy young man of about twenty-five, with a<br>kind face, white eyelashes, and a tremendous chest. It reminded<br>Gordon of the chest of a carthorse. He spoke with a good accent<br>but with vulgar turns of speech. For a minute or so he stood<br>regarding Gordon.<br><br>'You weren't half bad last night,' he said finally.<br><br>'I'm bad now.'<br><br>'You was worse last night, though. What you go and hit the<br>sergeant for?'<br><br>'Did I hit the sergeant?'<br><br>'Did you? Coo! He wasn't half wild. He turns to me and he says--<br>holding his ear he was, like this--he says, "Now, if that man<br>wasn't too drunk to stand, I'd knock his block off." It's all gone<br>down on your charge sheet. Drunk and disorderly. You'd only ha'<br>bin drunk and incapable if you hadn't of hit the sergeant.'<br><br>'Do you know what I shall get for this?'<br><br>'Five quid or fourteen days. You'll go up before Mr Groom. Lucky<br>for you it wasn't Mr Walker. He'd give you a month without the<br>option, Mr Walker would. Very severe on the drunks he is.<br>Teetotaller.'<br><br>Gordon had drunk some of the tea. It was nauseatingly sweet but<br>its warmth made him feel stronger. He gulped it down. At this<br>moment a nasty, snarling sort of voice--the sergeant whom Gordon<br>had hit, no doubt--yelped from somewhere outside:<br><br>'Take that man out and get him washed. Black Maria leaves at half<br>past nine.'<br><br>The constable hastened to open the cell door. As soon as Gordon<br>stepped outside he felt worse then ever. This was partly because<br>it was much colder in the passage than in the cell. He walked a<br>step or two, and then suddenly his head was going round and round.<br>'I'm going to be sick!' he cried. He was falling--he flung out a<br>hand and stopped himself against the wall. The constable's strong<br>arm went round him. Across the arm, as over a rail, Gordon sagged,<br>doubled up and limp. A jet of vomit burst from him. It was the<br>tea, of course. There was a gutter running along the stone floor.<br>At the end of the passage the moustachio'd sergeant, in tunic<br>without a belt, stood with his hand on his hip, looking on<br>disgustedly.<br><br>'Dirty little tyke,' he muttered, and turned away.<br><br>'Come on, old chap,' said the constable. 'You'll be better in half<br>a mo'.'<br><br>He half led, half dragged Gordon to a big stone sink at the end of<br>the passage and helped him to strip to the waist. His gentleness<br>was astonishing. He handled Gordon almost like a nurse handling a<br>child. Gordon had recovered enough strength to sluice himself with<br>the ice-cold water and rinse his mouth out. The constable gave him<br>a torn towel to dry himself with and then led him back to the cell.<br><br>'Now you sit quiet till the Black Maria comes. And take my tip--<br>when you go up to the court, you plead guilty and say you won't do<br>it again. Mr Groom won't be hard on you.'<br><br>'Where are my collar and tie?' said Gordon.<br><br>'We took 'em away last night. You'll get 'em back before you go up<br>to court. We had a bloke hung himself with his tie, once.'<br><br>Gordon sat down on the bed. For a little while he occupied himself<br>by calculating the number of porcelain bricks in the walls, then<br>sat with his elbows on his knees, his head between his hands. He<br>was still aching all over; he felt weak, cold, jaded, and, above<br>all, bored. He wished that boring business of going up to the<br>court could be avoided somehow. The thought of being put into some<br>jolting vehicle and taken across London to hang about in chilly<br>cells and passages, and of having to answer questions and be<br>lectured by magistrates, bored him indescribably. All he wanted<br>was to be left alone. But presently there was the sound of several<br>voices farther down the passage, and then of feet approaching. The<br>partition in the door was opened.<br><br>'Couple of visitors for you,' the constable said.<br><br>Gordon was bored by the very thought of visitors. Unwillingly he<br>looked up, and saw Flaxman and Ravelston looking in upon him. How<br>they had got there together was a mystery, but Gordon felt not the<br>faintest curiosity about it. They bored him. He wished they would<br>go away.<br><br>'Hullo, chappie!' said Flaxman.<br><br>'YOU here?' said Gordon with a sort of weary offensiveness.<br><br>Ravelston looked miserable. He had been up since the very early<br>morning, looking for Gordon. This was the first time he had seen<br>the interior of a police cell. His face shrank with disgust as he<br>looked at the chilly white-tiled place with its shameless W.C. in<br>the corner. But Flaxman was more accustomed to this kind of thing.<br>He cocked a practised eye at Gordon.<br><br>'I've seen 'em worse,' he said cheerfully. 'Give him a prairie<br>oyster and he'd buck up something wonderful. D'you know what your<br>eyes look like, chappie?' he added to Gordon. 'They look as if<br>they'd been taken out and poached.'<br><br>'I was drunk last night,' said Gordon, his head between his hands.<br><br>'I gathered something of the kind, old chappie.'<br><br>'Look here, Gordon,' said Ravelston, 'we came to bail you out, but<br>it seems we're too late. They're taking you up to court in a few<br>minutes' time. This is a bloody show. It's a pity you didn't give<br>them a false name when they brought you here last night.'<br><br>'Did I tell them my name?'<br><br>'You told them everything. I wish to God I hadn't let you out of<br>my sight. You slipped out of that house somehow and into the<br>street.'<br><br>'Wandering up and down Shaftesbury Avenue, drinking out of a<br>bottle,' said Flaxman appreciatively. 'But you oughtn't to have<br>hit the sergeant, old chappie! That was a bit of bloody<br>foolishness. And I don't mind telling you Mother Wisbeach is on<br>your track. When your pal here came round this morning and told<br>her you'd been for a night on the tiles, she took on as if you'd<br>done a bloody murder.'<br><br>'And look here, Gordon,' said Ravelston.<br><br>There was the familiar note of discomfort in his face. It was<br>something about money, as usual. Gordon looked up. Ravelston was<br>gazing into the distance.<br><br>'Look here.'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'About your fine. You'd better leave that to me. I'll pay it.'<br><br>'No, you won't.'<br><br>'My dear old chap! They'll send you to jail if I don't.'<br><br>'Oh, hell! I don't care.'<br><br>He did not care. At this moment he did not care if they sent him<br>to prison for a year. Of course he couldn't pay his fine himself.<br>He knew without even needing to look that he had no money left. He<br>would have given it all to Dora, or more probably she would have<br>pinched it. He lay down on the bed again and turned his back on<br>the others. In the sulky, sluggish state that he was in, his sole<br>desire was to get rid of them. They made a few more attempts to<br>talk to him, but he would not answer, and presently they went away.<br>Flaxman's voice boomed cheerfully down the passage. He was giving<br>Ravelston minute instructions as to how to make a prairie oyster.<br><br>The rest of that day was very beastly. Beastly was the ride in the<br>Black Maria, which, inside, was like nothing so much as a miniature<br>public lavatory, with tiny cubicles down each side, into which you<br>were locked and in which you had barely room to sit down.<br>Beastlier yet was the long wait in one of the cells adjoining the<br>magistrate's court. This cell was an exact replica of the cell at<br>the police station, even to having precisely the same number of<br>porcelain bricks. But it differed from the police station cell in<br>being repulsively dirty. It was cold, but the air was so fetid as<br>to be almost unbreathable. Prisoners were coming and going all the<br>time. They would be thrust into the cell, taken out after an hour<br>or two to go up to the court, and then perhaps brought back again<br>to wait while the magistrate decided upon their sentence or fresh<br>witnesses were sent for. There were always five or six men in the<br>cell, and there was nothing to sit on except the plank bed. And<br>the worst was that nearly all of them used the W.C.--there,<br>publicly, in the tiny cell. They could not help it. There was<br>nowhere else to go. And the plug of the beastly thing did not even<br>pull properly.<br><br>Until the afternoon Gordon felt sick and weak. He had had no<br>chance to shave, and his face was hatefully scrubby. At first he<br>merely sat on the corner of the plank bed, at the end nearest the<br>door, as far away from the W.C. as he could get, and took no notice<br>of the other prisoners. They bored and disgusted him; later, as<br>his headache wore off, he observed them with a faint interest.<br>There was a professional burglar, a lean worried-looking man with<br>grey hair, who was in a terrible stew about what would happen to<br>his wife and kids if he were sent to jail. He had been arrested<br>for 'loitering with intent to enter'--a vague offence for which you<br>generally get convicted if there are previous convictions against<br>you. He kept walking up and down, flicking the fingers of his<br>right hand with a curious nervous gesture, and exclaiming against<br>the unfairness of it. There was also a deaf mute who stank like a<br>ferret, and a small middle-aged Jew with a fur-collared overcoat,<br>who had been buyer to a large firm of kosher butchers. He had<br>bolted with twenty-seven pounds, gone to Aberdeen, of all places,<br>and spent the money on tarts. He too had a grievance, for he said<br>his case ought to have been tried in the rabbi's court instead of<br>being turned over to the police. There was also a publican who<br>had embezzled his Christmas club money. He was a big, hearty,<br>prosperous-looking man of about thirty-five, with a loud red face<br>and a loud blue overcoat--the sort of man who, if he were not a<br>publican, would be a bookie. His relatives had paid back the<br>embezzled money, all except twelve pounds, but the club members had<br>decided to prosecute. There was something in this man's eyes that<br>troubled Gordon. He carried everything off with a swagger, but all<br>the while there was that blank, staring look in his eyes; he would<br>fall into a kind of reverie at every gap in the conversation. It<br>was somehow rather dreadful to see him. There he was, still in his<br>smart clothes, with the splendour of a publican's life only a month<br>or two behind him; and now he was ruined, probably for ever. Like<br>all London publicans he was in the claw of the brewer, he would be<br>sold up and his furniture and fittings seized, and when he came out<br>of jail he would never have a pub or a job again.<br><br>The morning wore on with dismal slowness. You were allowed to<br>smoke--matches were forbidden, but the constable on duty outside<br>would give you a light through the trap in the door. Nobody had<br>any cigarettes except the publican, who had his pockets full of<br>them and distributed them freely. Prisoners came and went. A<br>ragged dirty man who claimed to be a coster 'up' for obstruction<br>was put into the cell for half an hour. He talked a great deal,<br>but the others were deeply suspicious of him; when he was taken out<br>again they all declared he was a 'split'. The police, it was said,<br>often put a 'split' into the cells, disguised as a prisoner, to<br>pick up information. Once there was great excitement when the<br>constable whispered through the trap that a murderer, or would-be<br>murderer, was being put into the cell next door. He was a youth of<br>eighteen who had stabbed his 'tart' in the belly, and she was not<br>expected to live. Once the trap opened and the tired, pale face of<br>a clergyman looked in. He saw the burglar, said wearily, 'YOU here<br>again, Jones?' and went away again. Dinner, so-called, was served<br>out at about twelve o'clock. All you got was a cup of tea and two<br>slices of bread and marg. You could have food sent in, though, if<br>you could pay for it. The publican had a good dinner sent in in<br>covered dishes; but he had no appetite for it, and gave most of it<br>away. Ravelston was still hanging about the court, waiting for<br>Gordon's case to come on, but he did not know the ropes well enough<br>to have food sent in to Gordon. Presently the burglar and the<br>publican were taken away, sentenced, and brought back to wait till<br>the Black Maria should take them off to jail. They each got nine<br>months. The publican questioned the burglar about what prison was<br>like. There was a conversation of unspeakable obscenity about the<br>lack of women there.<br><br>Gordon's case came on at half past two, and it was over so quickly<br>that it seemed preposterous to have waited all that time for it.<br>Afterwards he could remember nothing about the court except the<br>coat of arms over the magistrate's chair. The magistrate was<br>dealing with the drunks at the rate of two a minute. To the tune<br>of 'John-Smith-drunk six-shillings-move-on-NEXT!' they filed past<br>the railings of the dock, precisely like a crowd taking tickets at<br>a booking-office. Gordon's case, however, took two minutes instead<br>of thirty seconds, because he had been disorderly and the sergeant<br>had to testify that Gordon had struck him on the ear and called him<br>a ---- bastard. There was also a mild sensation in the court<br>because Gordon, when questioned at the police station, had<br>described himself as a poet. He must have been very drunk to say a<br>thing like that. The magistrate looked at him suspiciously.<br><br>'I see you call yourself a POET. ARE you a poet?'<br><br>'I write poetry,' said Gordon sulkily.<br><br>'Hm! Well, it doesn't seem to teach you to behave yourself, does<br>it? You will pay five pounds or go to prison for fourteen days.<br>NEXT!'<br><br>And that was all. Nevertheless, somewhere at the back of the court<br>a bored reporter had pricked up his ears.<br><br>On the other side of the court there was a room where a police<br>sergeant sat with a large ledger, entering up the drunks' fines and<br>taking payment. Those who could not pay were taken back to the<br>cells. Gordon had expected this to happen to himself. He was<br>quite resigned to going to prison. But when he emerged from the<br>court it was to find that Ravelston was waiting there and had<br>already paid his fine for him. Gordon did not protest. He allowed<br>Ravelston to pack him into a taxi and take him back to the flat in<br>Regent's Park. As soon as they got there Gordon had a hot bath; he<br>needed one, after the beastly contaminating grime of the last<br>twelve hours. Ravelston lent him a razor, lent him a clean shirt<br>and pyjamas and socks and underclothes, even went out of doors and<br>bought him a toothbrush. He was strangely solicitous about Gordon.<br>He could not rid himself of a guilty feeling that what had happened<br>last night was mainly his own fault; he ought to have put his foot<br>down and taken Gordon home as soon as he showed signs of being<br>drunk. Gordon scarcely noticed what was being done for him. Even<br>the fact the Ravelston had paid his fine failed to trouble him.<br>For the rest of that afternoon he lay in one of the armchairs in<br>front of the fire, reading a detective story. About the future he<br>refused to think. He grew sleepy very early. At eight o'clock he<br>went to bed in the spare bedroom and slept like a log for nine<br>hours.<br><br>It was not till next morning that he began to think seriously about<br>his situation. He woke in the wide caressing bed, softer and<br>warmer than any bed he had ever slept in, and began to grope about<br>for his matches. Then he remembered that in places like this you<br>didn't need matches to get a light, and felt for the electric<br>switch that hung on a cord at the bedhead. Soft light flooded the<br>room. There was a syphon of soda water on the bed-table. Gordon<br>discovered that even after thirty-six hours there was still a vile<br>taste in his mouth. He had a drink and looked about him.<br><br>It was a queer feeling, lying there in somebody else's pyjamas in<br>somebody else's bed. He felt that he had no business there--that<br>this wasn't the sort of place where he belonged. There was a sense<br>of guilt in lying here in luxury when he was ruined and hadn't a<br>penny in the world. For he was ruined right enough, there was no<br>doubt about that. He seemed to know with perfect certainty that<br>his job was lost. God knew what was going to happen next. The<br>memory of that stupid dull debauch rolled back upon him with<br>beastly vividness. He could recall everything, from his first pink<br>gin before he started out to Dora's peach-coloured garters. He<br>squirmed when he thought of Dora. WHY does one do these things?<br>Money again, always money! The rich don't behave like that. The<br>rich are graceful even in their vices. But if you have no money<br>you don't even know how to spend it when you get it. You just<br>splurge it frantically away, like a sailor in a bawdy-house his<br>first night ashore.<br><br>He had been in the clink, twelve hours. He thought of the cold<br>faecal stench of that cell at the police court. A foretaste of<br>future days. And everyone would know that he had been in the<br>clink. With luck it might be kept from Aunt Angela and Uncle<br>Walter, but Julia and Rosemary probably knew already. With<br>Rosemary it didn't matter so much, but Julia would be ashamed and<br>miserable. He thought of Julia. Her long thin back as she bent<br>over the tea-caddy; her good, goose-like, defeated face. She had<br>never lived. From childhood she had been sacrificed to him--to<br>Gordon, to 'the boy'. It might be a hundred quid he had 'borrowed'<br>from her in all these years; and then even five quid he couldn't<br>spare her. Five quid he had set aside for her, and then spent it<br>on a tart!<br><br>He turned out the light and lay on his back, wide awake. At this<br>moment he saw himself with frightful clarity. He took a sort of<br>inventory of himself and his possessions. Gordon Comstock, last of<br>the Comstocks, thirty years old, with twenty-six teeth left; with<br>no money and no job; in borrowed pyjamas in a borrowed bed; with<br>nothing before him except cadging and destitution, and nothing<br>behind him except squalid fooleries. His total wealth a puny body<br>and two cardboard suitcases full of worn-out clothes.<br><br>At seven Ravelston was awakened by a tap on his door. He rolled<br>over and said sleepily, 'Hullo?' Gordon came in, a dishevelled<br>figure almost lost in the borrowed silk pyjamas. Ravelston roused<br>himself, yawning. Theoretically he got up at the proletarian hour<br>of seven. Actually he seldom stirred until Mrs Beaver, the<br>charwoman, arrived at eight. Gordon pushed the hair out of his<br>eyes and sat down on the foot of Ravelston's bed.<br><br>'I say, Ravelston, this is bloody. I've been thinking things over.<br>There's going to be hell to pay.'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'I shall lose my job. McKechnie can't keep me on after I've been<br>in the clink. Besides, I ought to have been at work yesterday.<br>Probably the shop wasn't opened all day.'<br><br>Ravelston yawned. 'It'll be all right, I think. That fat chap--<br>what's his name? Flaxman--rang McKechnie up and told him you were<br>down with flu. He made it pretty convincing. He said your<br>temperature was a hundred and three. Of course your landlady<br>knows. But I don't suppose she'd tell McKechnie.'<br><br>'But suppose it's got into the papers!'<br><br>'Oh, lord! I suppose that might happen. The char brings the<br>papers up at eight. But do they report drunk cases? Surely not?'<br><br>Mrs Beaver brought the Telegraph and the Herald. Ravelston sent<br>her out for the Mail and the Express. They searched hurriedly<br>through the police-court news. Thank God! it hadn't 'got into the<br>papers' after all. There was no reason why it should, as a matter<br>of fact. It was not as if Gordon had been a racing motorist or a<br>professional footballer. Feeling better, Gordon managed to eat<br>some breakfast, and after breakfast Ravelston went out. It was<br>agreed that he should go up to the shop, see Mr McKechnie, give him<br>further details of Gordon's illness, and find out how the land lay.<br>It seemed quite natural to Ravelston to waste several days in<br>getting Gordon out of his scrape. All the morning Gordon hung<br>about the flat, restless and out of sorts, smoking cigarettes in an<br>endless chain. Now that he was alone, hope had deserted him. He<br>knew by profound instinct that Mr McKechnie would have heard about<br>his arrest. It wasn't the kind of thing you could keep dark. He<br>had lost his job, and that was all about it.<br><br>He lounged across to the window and looked out. A desolate day;<br>the whitey-grey sky looked as if it could never be blue again; the<br>naked trees wept slowly into the gutters. Down a neighbouring<br>street the cry of the coal-man echoed mournfully. Only a fortnight<br>to Christmas now. Jolly to be out of work at this time of year!<br>But the thought, instead of frightening him, merely bored him. The<br>peculiar lethargic feeling, the stuffy heaviness behind the eyes,<br>that one has after a fit of drunkenness, seemed to have settled<br>upon him permanently. The prospect of searching for another job<br>bored him even more than the prospect of poverty. Besides, he<br>would never find another job. There are no jobs to be had<br>nowadays. He was going down, down into the sub-world of the<br>unemployed--down, down into God knew what workhouse depths of dirt<br>and hunger and futility. And chiefly he was anxious to get it over<br>with as little fuss and effort as possible.<br><br>Ravelston came back at about one o'clock. He pulled his gloves off<br>and threw them into a chair. He looked tired and depressed.<br>Gordon saw at a glance that the game was up.<br><br>'He's heard, of course?' he said.<br><br>'Everything, I'm afraid.'<br><br>'How? I suppose that cow of a Wisbeach woman went and sneaked to<br>him?'<br><br>'No. It was in the paper after all. The local paper. He got it<br>out of that.'<br><br>'Oh, hell! I'd forgotten that.'<br><br>Ravelston produced from his coat pocket a folded copy of a bi-<br>weekly paper. It was one that they took in at the shop because Mr<br>McKechnie advertised in it--Gordon had forgotten that. He opened<br>it. Gosh! What a splash! It was all over the middle page.<br><br><br>BOOKSELLER'S ASSISTANT FINED<br><br>MAGISTRATE'S SEVERE STRICTURE<br><br>'DISGRACEFUL FRACAS'<br><br><br>There were nearly two columns of it. Gordon had never been so<br>famous before and never would be again. They must have been very<br>hard up for a bit of news. But these local papers have a curious<br>notion of patriotism. They are so avid for local news that a<br>bicycle-accident in the Harrow Road will occupy more space than a<br>European crisis, and such items of news as 'Hampstead Man on Murder<br>Charge' or 'Dismembered Baby in Cellar in Camberwell' are displayed<br>with positive pride.<br><br>Ravelston described his interview with Mr McKechnie. Mr McKechnie,<br>it seemed, was torn between his rage against Gordon and his desire<br>not to offend such a good customer as Ravelston. But of course,<br>after such a thing like that, you could hardly expect him to take<br>Gordon back. These scandals were bad for trade, and besides, he<br>was justly angry at the lies Flaxman had told him over the phone.<br>But he was angriest of all at the thought of HIS assistant being<br>drunk and disorderly. Ravelston said that the drunkenness seemed<br>to anger him in a way that was peculiar. He gave the impression<br>that he would almost have preferred Gordon to pinch money out of<br>the till. Of course, he was a teetotaller himself. Gordon had<br>sometimes wondered whether he wasn't also a secret drinker, in the<br>traditional Scottish style. His nose was certainly very red. But<br>perhaps it was snuff that did it. Anyway, that was that. Gordon<br>was in the soup, full fathom five.<br><br>'I suppose the Wisbeach will stick to my clothes and things,' he<br>said. 'I'm not going round there to fetch them. Besides, I owe<br>her a week's rent.'<br><br>'Oh, don't worry about that. I'll see to your rent and everything.'<br><br>'My dear chap, I can't let you pay my rent!'<br><br>'Oh, dash it!' Ravelston's face grew faintly pink. He looked<br>miserably into the distance, and then said what he had to say all<br>in a sudden burst: 'Look here, Gordon, we must get this settled.<br>You've just got to stay here till this business has blown over.<br>I'll see you through about money and all that. You needn't think<br>you're being a nuisance, because you're not. And anyway, it's only<br>till you get another job.'<br><br>Gordon moved moodily away from him, his hands in his pockets. He<br>had foreseen all this, of course. He knew that he ought to refuse,<br>he WANTED to refuse, and yet he had not quite the courage.<br><br>'I'm not going to sponge on you like that,' he said sulkily.<br><br>'Don't use such expressions, for God's sake! Besides, where could<br>you go if you didn't stay here?'<br><br>'I don't know--into the gutter, I suppose. It's where I belong.<br>The sooner I get there the better.'<br><br>'Rot! You're going to stay here till you've found another job.'<br><br>'But there isn't a job in the world. It might be a year before I<br>found a job. I don't WANT a job.'<br><br>'You mustn't talk like that. You'll find a job right enough.<br>Something's bound to turn up. And for God's sake don't talk about<br>SPONGING on me. It's only an arrangement between friends. If you<br>really want to, you can pay it all back when you've got the money.'<br><br>'Yes--WHEN!'<br><br>But in the end he let himself be persuaded. He had known that he<br>would let himself be persuaded. He stayed on at the flat, and<br>allowed Ravelston to go round to Willowbed Road and pay his rent<br>and recover his two cardboard suitcases; he even allowed Ravelston<br>to 'lend' him a further two pounds for current expenses. His heart<br>sickened while he did it. He was living on Ravelston--sponging on<br>Ravelston. How could there ever be a real friendship between them<br>again? Besides, in his heart he didn't want to be helped. He only<br>wanted to be left alone. He was headed for the gutter; better to<br>reach the gutter quickly and get it over. Yet for the time being<br>he stayed, simply because he lacked the courage to do otherwise.<br><br>But as for this business of getting a job, it was hopeless from the<br>start. Even Ravelston, though rich, could not manufacture jobs out<br>of nothing. Gordon knew beforehand that there were no jobs going<br>begging in the book trade. During the next three days he wore his<br>shoes out traipsing from bookseller to bookseller. At shop after<br>shop he set his teeth, marched in, demanded to see the manager, and<br>three minutes later marched out again with his nose in the air.<br>The answer was always the same--no jobs vacant. A few booksellers<br>were taking on an extra man for the Christmas rush, but Gordon was<br>not the type they were looking for. He was neither smart nor<br>servile; he wore shabby clothes and spoke with the accent of a<br>gentleman. Besides, a few questions always brought it out that he<br>had been sacked from his last job for drunkenness. After only<br>three days he gave it up. He knew it was no use. It was only to<br>please Ravelston that he had even been pretending to look for work.<br><br>In the evening he trailed back to the flat, footsore and with his<br>nerves on edge from a series of snubs. He was making all his<br>journeys on foot, to economize Ravelston's two pounds. When he got<br>back Ravelston had just come up from the office and was sitting in<br>one of the armchairs in front of the fire, with some long galley-<br>proofs over his knee. He looked up as Gordon came in.<br><br>'Any luck?' he said as usual.<br><br>Gordon did not answer. If he had answered it would have been with<br>a stream of obscenities. Without even looking at Ravelston he went<br>straight into his bedroom, kicked off his shoes, and flung himself<br>on the bed. He hated himself at this moment. Why had he come<br>back? What right had he to come back and sponge on Ravelston when<br>he hadn't even the intention of looking for a job any longer? He<br>ought to have stayed out in the streets, slept in Trafalgar Square,<br>begged--anything. But he hadn't the guts to face the streets as<br>yet. The prospect of warmth and shelter had tugged him back. He<br>lay with his hands beneath his head, in a mixture of apathy and<br>self-hatred. After about half an hour he heard the door-bell ring<br>and Ravelston get up to answer it. It was that bitch Hermione<br>Slater, presumably. Ravelston had introduced Gordon to Hermione a<br>couple of days ago, and she had treated him like dirt. But a<br>moment later there was a knock at the bedroom door.<br><br>'What is it?' said Gordon.<br><br>'Somebody's come to see you,' said Ravelston.<br><br>'To see ME?'<br><br>'Yes. Come on into the other room.'<br><br>Gordon swore and rolled sluggishly off the bed. When he got to the<br>other room he found that the visitor was Rosemary. He had been<br>half expecting her, of course, but it wearied him to see her. He<br>knew why she had come; to sympathize with him, to pity him, to<br>reproach him--it was all the same. In his despondent, bored mood<br>he did not want to make the effort of talking to her. All he<br>wanted was to be left alone. But Ravelston was glad to see her.<br>He had taken a liking to her in their single meeting and thought<br>she might cheer Gordon up. He made a transparent pretext to go<br>downstairs to the office, leaving the two of them together.<br><br>They were alone, but Gordon made no move to embrace her. He was<br>standing in front of the fire, round-shouldered, his hands in his<br>coat pockets, his feet thrust into a pair of Ravelston's slippers<br>which were much too big for him. She came rather hesitantly<br>towards him, not yet taking off her hat or her coat with the lamb-<br>skin collar. It hurt her to see him. In less than a week his<br>appearance had deteriorated strangely. Already he had that<br>unmistakable, seedy, lounging look of a man who is out of work.<br>His face seemed to have grown thinner, and there were rings round<br>his eyes. Also it was obvious that he had not shaved that day.<br><br>She laid her hand on his arm, rather awkwardly, as a woman does<br>when it is she who has to make the first embrace.<br><br>'Gordon--'<br><br>'Well?'<br><br>He said it almost sulkily. The next moment she was in his arms.<br>But it was she who had made the first movement, not he. Her head<br>was on his breast, and behold! she was struggling with all her<br>might against the tears that almost overwhelmed her. It bored<br>Gordon dreadfully. He seemed so often to reduce her to tears! And<br>he didn't want to be cried over; he only wanted to be left alone--<br>alone to sulk and despair. As he held her there, one hand<br>mechanically caressing her shoulder, his main feeling was boredom.<br>She had made things more difficult for him by coming here. Ahead<br>of him were dirt, cold, hunger, the streets, the workhouse, and the<br>jail. It was against THAT that he had got to steel himself. And<br>he could steel himself, if only she would leave him alone and not<br>come plaguing him with these irrelevant emotions.<br><br>He pushed her a little way from him. She had recovered herself<br>quickly, as she always did.<br><br>'Gordon, my dear one! Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry!'<br><br>'Sorry about what?'<br><br>'You losing your job and everything. You look so unhappy.'<br><br>'I'm not unhappy. Don't pity me, for God's sake.'<br><br>He disengaged himself from her arms. She pulled her hat off and<br>threw it into a chair. She had come here with something definite<br>to say. It was something she had refrained from saying all these<br>years--something that it had seemed to her a point of chivalry not<br>to say. But now it had got to be said, and she would come straight<br>out with it. It was not in her nature to beat about the bush.<br><br>'Gordon, will you do something to please me?'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Will you go back to the New Albion?'<br><br>So that was it! Of course he had foreseen it. She was going to<br>start nagging at him like all the others. She was going to add<br>herself to the band of people who worried him and badgered him to<br>'get on'. But what else could you expect? It was what any woman<br>would say. The marvel was that she had never said it before. Go<br>back to the New Albion! It had been the sole significant action of<br>his life, leaving the New Albion. It was his religion, you might<br>say, to keep out of that filthy money-world. Yet at this moment he<br>could not remember with any clarity the motives for which he had<br>left the New Albion. All he knew was that he would never go back,<br>not if the skies fell, and that the argument he foresaw bored him<br>in advance.<br><br>He shrugged his shoulders and looked away. 'The New Albion<br>wouldn't take me back,' he said shortly.<br><br>'Yes, they would. You remember what Mr Erskine said. It's not so<br>long ago--only two years. And they're always on the look-out for<br>good copywriters. Everyone at the office says so. I'm sure they'd<br>give you a job if you went and asked them. And they'd pay you at<br>least four pounds a week.'<br><br>'Four pounds a week! Splendid! I could afford to keep an<br>aspidistra on that, couldn't I?'<br><br>'No, Gordon, don't joke about it now.'<br><br>'I'm not joking. I'm serious.'<br><br>'You mean you won't go back to them--not even if they offered you a<br>job?'<br><br>'Not in a thousand years. Not if they paid me fifty pounds a<br>week.'<br><br>'But why? Why?'<br><br>'I've told you why,' he said wearily.<br><br>She looked at him helplessly. After all, it was no use. There was<br>this money-business standing in the way--these meaningless scruples<br>which she had never understood but which she had accepted merely<br>because they were his. She felt all the impotence, the resentment<br>of a woman who sees an abstract idea triumphing over common sense.<br>How maddening it was, that he should let himself be pushed into the<br>gutter by a thing like that! She said almost angrily:<br><br>'I don't understand you, Gordon, I really don't. Here you are out<br>of work, you may be starving in a little while for all you know;<br>and yet when there's a good job which you can have almost for the<br>asking, you won't take it.'<br><br>'No, you're quite right. I won't.'<br><br>'But you must have SOME kind of job, mustn't you?'<br><br>'A job, but not a GOOD job. I've explained that God knows how<br>often. I dare say I'll get a job of sorts sooner or later. The<br>same kind of job as I had before.'<br><br>'But I don't believe you're even TRYING to get a job, are you?'<br><br>'Yes, I am. I've been out all today seeing booksellers.'<br><br>'And you didn't even shave this morning!' she said, changing her<br>ground with feminine swiftness.<br><br>He felt his chin. 'I don't believe I did, as a matter of fact.'<br><br>'And then you expect people to give you a job! Oh, Gordon!'<br><br>'Oh, well, what does it matter? It's too much fag to shave every<br>day.'<br><br>'You're letting yourself go to pieces,' she said bitterly. 'You<br>don't seem to WANT to make any effort. You want to sink--just<br>SINK!'<br><br>'I don't know--perhaps. I'd sooner sink than rise.'<br><br>There were further arguments. It was the first time she had ever<br>spoken to him like this. Once again the tears came into her eyes,<br>and once again she fought them back. She had come here swearing to<br>herself that she would not cry. The dreadful thing was that her<br>tears, instead of distressing him, merely bored him. It was as<br>though he COULD not care, and yet at his very centre there was an<br>inner heart that cared because he could not care. If only she<br>would leave him alone! Alone, alone! Free from the nagging<br>consciousness of his failure; free to sink, as she had said, down,<br>down into quiet worlds where money and effort and moral obligation<br>did not exist. Finally he got away from her and went back to the<br>spare bedroom, it was definitely a quarrel--the first really deadly<br>quarrel they had ever had. Whether it was to be final he did not<br>know. Nor did he care, at this moment. He locked the door behind<br>him and lay on the bed smoking a cigarette. He must get out of<br>this place, and quickly! Tomorrow morning he would clear out.<br>No more sponging on Ravelston! No more blackmail to the gods<br>of decency! Down, down, into the mud--down to the streets, the<br>workhouse, and the jail. It was only there that he could be at<br>peace.<br><br>Ravelston came upstairs to find Rosemary alone and on the point of<br>departure. She said good-bye and then suddenly turned to him and<br>laid her hand on his arm. She felt that she knew him well enough<br>now to take him into her confidence.<br><br>'Mr Ravelston, please--WILL you try and persuade Gordon to get a<br>job?'<br><br>'I'll do what I can. Of course it's always difficult. But I<br>expect we'll find him a job of sorts before long.'<br><br>'It's so dreadful to see him like this! He goes absolutely to<br>pieces. And all the time, you see, there's a job he could quite<br>easily get if he wanted it--a really GOOD job. It's not that he<br>can't, it's simply that he won't.'<br><br>She explained about the New Albion. Ravelston rubbed his nose.<br><br>'Yes. As a matter of fact I've heard all about that. We talked it<br>over when he left the New Albion.'<br><br>'But you don't think he was right to leave them?' she said,<br>promptly divining that Ravelston DID think Gordon right.<br><br>'Well--I grant you it wasn't very wise. But there's a certain<br>amount of truth in what he says. Capitalism's corrupt and we ought<br>to keep outside it--that's his idea. It's not practicable, but in<br>a way it's sound.'<br><br>'Oh, I dare say it's all right as a theory! But when he's out of<br>work and when he could get this job if he chose to ask for it--<br>SURELY you don't think he's right to refuse?'<br><br>'Not from a common-sense point of view. But in principle--well,<br>yes.'<br><br>'Oh, in principle! We can't afford principles, people like us.<br>THAT'S what Gordon doesn't seem to understand.'<br><br>Gordon did not leave the flat next morning. One resolves to do<br>these things, one WANTS to do them; but when the time comes, in the<br>cold morning light, they somehow don't get done. He would stay<br>just one day more he told himself; and then again it was 'just one<br>day more', until five whole days had passed since Rosemary's visit,<br>and he was still lurking there, living on Ravelston, with not even<br>a flicker of a job in sight. He still made some pretence of<br>searching for work, but he only did it to save his face. He would<br>go out and loaf for hours in public libraries, and then come home<br>to lie on the bed in the spare bedroom, dressed except for his<br>shoes, smoking endless cigarettes. And for all that inertia and<br>the fear of the streets still held him there, those five days were<br>awful, damnable, unspeakable. There is nothing more dreadful in<br>the world than to live in somebody else's house, eating his bread<br>and doing nothing in return for it. And perhaps it is worst of all<br>when your benefactor won't for a moment admit that he is your<br>benefactor. Nothing could have exceeded Ravelston's delicacy. He<br>would have perished rather than admit that Gordon was sponging on<br>him. He had paid Gordon's fine, he had paid his arrears of rent,<br>he had kept him for a week, and he had 'lent' him two pounds on top<br>of that; but it was nothing, it was a mere arrangement between<br>friends, Gordon would do the same for him another time. From time<br>to time Gordon made feeble efforts to escape, which always ended in<br>the same way.<br><br>'Look here, Ravelston, I can't stay here any longer. You've kept<br>me long enough. I'm going to clear out tomorrow morning.'<br><br>'But my dear old chap! Do be sensible. You haven't--' But no!<br>Not even now, when Gordon was openly on the rocks, could Ravelston<br>say, 'You haven't got any money.' One can't say things like that.<br>He compromised: 'Where are you going to live, anyway?'<br><br>'God knows--I don't care. There are common lodging-houses and<br>places. I've got a few bob left.'<br><br>'Don't be such an ass. You'd much better stay here till you've<br>found a job.'<br><br>'But it might be months, I tell you. I can't live on you like<br>this.'<br><br>'Rot, my dear chap! I like having you here.'<br><br>But of course, in his inmost heart, he didn't really like having<br>Gordon there. How should he? It was an impossible situation.<br>There was a tension between them all the time. It is always so<br>when one person is living on another. However delicately<br>disguised, charity is still horrible; there is a malaise, almost a<br>secret hatred, between the giver and the receiver. Gordon knew<br>that his friendship with Ravelston would never be the same again.<br>Whatever happened afterwards, the memory of this evil time would be<br>between them. The feeling of his dependent position, of being in<br>the way, unwanted, a nuisance, was with him night and day. At<br>meals he would scarcely eat, he would not smoke Ravelston's<br>cigarettes, but bought himself cigarettes out of his few remaining<br>shillings. He would not even light the gas-fire in his bedroom.<br>He would have made himself invisible if he could. Every day, of<br>course, people were coming and going at the flat and at the office.<br>All of them saw Gordon and grasped his status. Another of<br>Ravelston's pet scroungers, they all said. He even detected a<br>gleam of professional jealousy in one or two of the hangers-on of<br>Antichrist. Three times during that week Hermione Slater came.<br>After his first encounter with her he fled from the flat as soon as<br>she appeared; on one occasion, when she came at night, he had to<br>stay out of doors till after midnight. Mrs Beaver, the charwoman,<br>had also 'seen through' Gordon. She knew his type. He was another<br>of those good-for-nothing young 'writing gentlemen' who sponged on<br>poor Mr Ravelston. So in none too subtle ways she made things<br>uncomfortable for Gordon. Her favourite trick was to rout him out<br>with broom and pan--'Now, Mr Comstock, I've got to do this room<br>out, IF you please'--from whichever room he had settled down in.<br><br>But in the end, unexpectedly and through no effort of his own,<br>Gordon did get a job. One morning a letter came for Ravelston from<br>Mr McKechnie. Mr McKechnie had relented--not to the extent of<br>taking Gordon back, of course, but to the extent of helping him<br>find another job. He said that a Mr Cheeseman, a bookseller in<br>Lambeth, was looking for an assistant. From what he said it was<br>evident that Gordon could get the job if he applied for it; it was<br>equally evident that there was some snag about the job. Gordon had<br>vaguely heard of Mr Cheeseman--in the book trade everybody knows<br>everybody else. In his heart the news bored him. He didn't really<br>want this job. He didn't want ever to work again; all he wanted<br>was to sink, sink, effortless, down into the mud. But he couldn't<br>disappoint Ravelston after all Ravelston had done for him. So the<br>same morning he went down to Lambeth to inquire about the job.<br><br>The shop was in the desolate stretch of road south of Waterloo<br>Bridge. It was a poky, mean-looking shop, and the name over it,<br>in faded gilt, was not Cheeseman but Eldridge. In the window,<br>however, there were some valuable calf folios, and some sixteenth-<br>century maps which Gordon thought must be worth money. Evidently<br>Mr Cheeseman specialized in 'rare' books. Gordon plucked up his<br>courage and went in.<br><br>As the door-bell ping'd, a tiny, evil-looking creature, with a<br>sharp nose and heavy black eyebrows, emerged from the office behind<br>the shop. He looked up at Gordon with a kind of nosy malice. When<br>he spoke it was in an extraordinary clipped manner, as though he<br>were biting each word in half before it escaped from him. 'Ot c'n<br>I do f'yer!'--that approximately was what it sounded like. Gordon<br>explained why he had come. Mr Cheeseman shot a meaning glance at<br>him and answered in the same clipped manner as before:<br><br>'Oh, eh? Comstock, eh? Come 'is way. Got mi office back here.<br>Bin 'specting you.'<br><br>Gordon followed him. Mr Cheeseman was a rather sinister little<br>man, almost small enough to be called a dwarf, with very black<br>hair, and slightly deformed. As a rule a dwarf, when malformed,<br>has a full-sized torso and practically no legs. With Mr Cheeseman<br>it was the other way about. His legs were normal length, but the<br>top half of his body was so short that his buttocks seemed to<br>sprout almost immediately below his shoulder blades. This gave<br>him, in walking, a resemblance to a pair of scissors. He had the<br>powerful bony shoulders of the dwarf, the large ugly hands, and the<br>sharp nosing movements of the head. His clothes had that peculiar<br>hardened, shiny texture of clothes that are very old and very<br>dirty. They were just going into the office when the door-bell<br>ping'd again, and a customer came in, holding out a book from the<br>sixpenny box outside and half a crown. Mr Cheeseman did not take<br>the change out of the till--apparently there was no till--but<br>produced a very greasy wash-leather purse from some secret place<br>under his waistcoat. He handled the purse, which was almost lost<br>in his big hands, in a peculiarly secretive way, as though to hide<br>it from sight.<br><br>'I like keep mi money i' mi pocket,' he explained, with an upward<br>glance, as they went into the office.<br><br>It was apparent that Mr Cheeseman clipped his words from a notion<br>that words cost money and ought not to be wasted. In the office<br>they had a talk, and Mr Cheeseman extorted from Gordon the<br>confession that he had been sacked for drunkenness. As a matter of<br>fact he knew all about this already. He had heard about Gordon<br>from Mr McKechnie, whom he had met at an auction a few days<br>earlier. He had pricked up his ears when he heard the story, for<br>he was on the look-out for an assistant, and clearly an assistant<br>who had been sacked for drunkenness would come at reduced wages.<br>Gordon saw that his drunkenness was going to be used as a weapon<br>against him. Yet Mr Cheeseman did not seem absolutely unfriendly.<br>He seemed to be the kind of person who will cheat you if he can,<br>and bully you if you give him the chance, but who will also regard<br>you with a contemptuous good-humour. He took Gordon into his<br>confidence, talked of conditions in the trade, and boasted with<br>much chuckling of his own astuteness. He had a peculiar chuckle,<br>his mouth curving upwards at the corners and his large nose seeming<br>about to disappear into it.<br><br>Recently, he told Gordon, he had had an idea for a profitable side-<br>line. He was going to start a twopenny library; but it would have<br>to be quite separate from the shop, because anything so low-class<br>would frighten away the book-lovers who came to the shop in search<br>of 'rare' books. He had taken premises a little distance away, and<br>in the lunch-hour he took Gordon to see them. They were farther<br>down the dreary street, between a flyblown ham-and-beef shop and a<br>smartish undertaker. The ads in the undertaker's window caught<br>Gordon's eye. It seems you can get underground for as little as<br>two pounds ten nowadays. You can even get buried on the hire-<br>purchase. There was also an ad for cremations--'Reverent,<br>Sanitary, and Inexpensive.'<br><br>The premises consisted of a single narrow room--a mere pipe of a<br>room with a window as wide as itself, furnished with a cheap desk,<br>one chair, and a card index. The new-painted shelves were ready<br>and empty. This was not, Gordon saw at a glance, going to be the<br>kind of library that he had presided over at McKechnie's.<br>McKechnie's library had been comparatively highbrow. It had<br>dredged no deeper than Dell, and it even had books by Lawrence and<br>Huxley. But this was one of those cheap arid evil little libraries<br>('mushroom libraries', they are called) which are springing up all<br>over London and are deliberately aimed at the uneducated. In<br>libraries like these there is not a single book that is ever<br>mentioned in the reviews or that any civilized person has ever<br>heard of. The books are published by special low-class firms and<br>turned out by wretched hacks at the rate of four a year, as<br>mechanically as sausages and with much less skill. In effect they<br>are merely fourpenny novelettes disguised as novels, and they only<br>cost the library-proprietor one and eightpence a volume. Mr<br>Cheeseman explained that he had not ordered the books yet. He<br>spoke of 'ordering the books' as one might speak of ordering a ton<br>of coals. He was going to start with five hundred assorted titles,<br>he said. The shelves were already marked off into sections--'Sex',<br>'Crime', 'Wild West', and so forth.<br><br>He offered Gordon the job. It was very simple. All you had to do<br>was to remain there ten hours a day, hand out the book, take the<br>money, and choke off the more obvious book-pinchers. The pay, he<br>added with a measuring, sidelong glance, was thirty shillings a<br>week.<br><br>Gordon accepted promptly. Mr Cheeseman was perhaps faintly<br>disappointed. He had expected an argument, and would have enjoyed<br>crushing Gordon by reminding him that beggars can't be choosers.<br>But Gordon was satisfied. The job would do. There was no TROUBLE<br>about a job like this; no room for ambition, no effort, no hope.<br>Ten bob less--ten bob nearer the mud. It was what he wanted.<br><br>He 'borrowed' another two pounds from Ravelston and took a<br>furnished bed-sitting room, eight bob a week, in a filthy alley<br>parallel to Lambeth Cut. Mr Cheeseman ordered the five hundred<br>assorted titles, and Gordon started work on the twentieth of<br>December. This, as it happened, was his thirtieth birthday. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/8.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/10.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
