<h2>Chapter 5</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br>'We're printing that poem of yours in next month's Antichrist,'<br>said Ravelston from his first-floor window.<br><br>Gordon, on the pavement below, affected to have forgotten the poem<br>Ravelston was speaking about; he remembered it intimately, of<br>course, as he remembered all his poems.<br><br>'Which poem?' he said.<br><br>'The one about the dying prostitute. We thought it was rather<br>successful.' Gordon laughed a laugh of gratified conceit, and<br>managed to pass it off as a laugh of sardonic amusement.<br><br>'Aha! A dying prostitute! That's rather what you might call one<br>of my subjects. I'll do you one about an aspidistra next time.'<br><br>Ravelston's over-sensitive, boyish face, framed by nice dark-brown<br>hair, drew back a little from the window.<br><br>'It's intolerably cold,' he said. 'You'd better come up and have<br>some food, or something.'<br><br>'No, you come down. I've had dinner. Let's go to a pub and have<br>some beer.'<br><br>'All right then. Half a minute while I get my shoes on.'<br><br>They had been talking for some minutes, Gordon on the pavement,<br>Ravelston leaning out of the window above. Gordon had announced<br>his arrival not by knocking at the door but by throwing a pebble<br>against the window pane. He never, if he could help it, set foot<br>inside Ravelston's flat. There was something in the atmosphere of<br>the flat that upset him and made him feel mean, dirty, and out of<br>place. It was so overwhelmingly, though unconsciously, upper-<br>class. Only in the street or in a pub could he feel himself<br>approximately Ravelston's equal. It would have astonished<br>Ravelston to learn that his four-roomed flat, which he thought of<br>as a poky little place, had this effect upon Gordon. To Ravelston,<br>living in the wilds of Regent's Park was practically the same thing<br>as living in the slums; he had chosen to live there, en bon<br>socialiste, precisely as your social snob will live in a mews in<br>Mayfair for the sake of the 'WI' on his notepaper. It was part of<br>a lifelong attempt to escape from his own class and become, as it<br>were, an honorary member of the proletariat. Like all such<br>attempts, it was foredoomed to failure. No rich man ever succeeds<br>in disguising himself as a poor man; for money, like murder, will<br>out.<br><br>On the street door there was a brass plate inscribed:<br><br><br>P. W. H. RAVELSTON<br><br>ANTICHRIST<br><br><br>Ravelston lived on the first floor, and the editorial offices of<br>Antichrist were downstairs. Antichrist was a middle- to high-brow<br>monthly, Socialist in a vehement but ill-defined way. In general,<br>it gave the impression of being edited by an ardent Nonconformist<br>who had transferred his allegiance from God to Marx, and in doing<br>so had got mixed up with a gang of vers libre poets. This was not<br>really Ravelston's character; merely he was softer-hearted than an<br>editor ought to be, and consequently was at the mercy of his<br>contributors. Practically anything got printed in Antichrist if<br>Ravelston suspected that its author was starving.<br><br>Ravelston appeared a moment later, hatless and pulling on a pair of<br>gauntlet gloves. You could tell him at a glance for a rich young<br>man. He wore the uniform of the moneyed intelligentsia; an old<br>tweed coat--but it was one of those coats which have been made by a<br>good tailor and grow more aristocratic as they grow older--very<br>loose grey flannel bags, a grey pullover, much-worn brown shoes.<br>He made a point of going everywhere, even to fashionable houses and<br>expensive restaurants, in these clothes, just to show his contempt<br>for upper-class conventions; he did not fully realize that it is<br>only the upper classes who can do these things. Though he was a<br>year older than Gordon he looked much younger. He was very tall,<br>with a lean, wide-shouldered body and the typical lounging grace<br>of the upper-class youth. But there was something curiously<br>apologetic in his movements and in the expression of his face. He<br>seemed always in the act of stepping out of somebody else's way.<br>When expressing an opinion he would rub his nose with the back of<br>his left forefinger. The truth was that in every moment of his<br>life he was apologizing, tacitly, for the largeness of his income.<br>You could make him uncomfortable as easily by reminding him that he<br>was rich as you could make Gordon by reminding him that he was<br>poor.<br><br>'You've had dinner, I gather?' said Ravelston, in his rather<br>Bloomsbury voice.<br><br>'Yes, ages ago. Haven't you?'<br><br>'Oh, yes, certainly. Oh, quite!'<br><br>It was twenty past eight and Gordon had had no food since midday.<br>Neither had Ravelston. Gordon did not know that Ravelston was<br>hungry, but Ravelston knew that Gordon was hungry, and Gordon knew<br>that Ravelston knew it. Nevertheless, each saw good reason for<br>pretending not to be hungry. They seldom or never had meals<br>together. Gordon would not let Ravelston buy his meals for him,<br>and for himself he could not afford to go to restaurants, not even<br>to a Lyons or an A.B.C. This was Monday and he had five and<br>ninepence left. He might afford a couple of pints at a pub, but<br>not a proper meal. When he and Ravelston met it was always agreed,<br>with silent manoeuvrings, that they should do nothing that involved<br>spending money, beyond the shilling or so one spends in a pub. In<br>this way the fiction was kept up that there was no serious<br>difference in their incomes.<br><br>Gordon sidled closer to Ravelston as they started down the<br>pavement. He would have taken his arm, only of course one can't do<br>that kind of thing. Beside Ravelston's taller, comelier figure he<br>looked frail, fretful, and miserably shabby. He adored Ravelston<br>and was never quite at ease in his presence. Ravelston had not<br>merely a charm of manner, but also a kind of fundamental decency,<br>a graceful attitude to life, which Gordon scarcely encountered<br>elsewhere. Undoubtedly it was bound up with the fact that<br>Ravelston was rich. For money buys all virtues. Money suffereth<br>long and is kind, is not puffed up, doth not behave unseemly,<br>seeketh not her own. But in some ways Ravelston was not even like<br>a moneyed person. The fatty degeneration of the spirit which goes<br>with wealth had missed him, or he had escaped it by a conscious<br>effort. Indeed his whole life was a struggle to escape it. It was<br>for this reason that he gave up his time and a large part of his<br>income to editing an unpopular Socialist monthly. And apart from<br>Antichrist, money flowed from him in all directions. A tribe of<br>cadgers ranging from poets to pavement-artists browsed upon him<br>unceasingly. For himself he lived upon eight hundred a year or<br>thereabouts. Even of this income he was acutely ashamed. It was<br>not, he realized, exactly a proletarian income; but he had never<br>learned to get along on less. Eight hundred a year was a minimum<br>living wage to him, as two pounds a week was to Gordon.<br><br>'How is your work getting on?' said Ravelston presently.<br><br>'Oh, as usual. It's a drowsy kind of job. Swapping back-chat with<br>old hens about Hugh Walpole. I don't object to it.'<br><br>'I meant your own work--your writing. Is London Pleasures getting<br>on all right?'<br><br>'Oh, Christ! Don't speak of it. It's turning my hair grey.'<br><br>'Isn't it going forward at all?'<br><br>'My books don't go forward. They go backward.'<br><br>Ravelston sighed. As editor of Antichrist, he was used to<br>encouraging despondent poets that it had become a second nature to<br>him. He did not need telling why Gordon 'couldn't' write, and why<br>all poets nowadays 'can't' write, and why when they do write it is<br>something as arid as the rattling of a pea inside a big drum. He<br>said with sympathetic gloom:<br><br>'Of course I admit this isn't a hopeful age to write poetry in.'<br><br>'You bet it isn't.'<br><br>Gordon kicked his heel against the pavement. He wished that London<br>Pleasures had not been mentioned. It brought back to him the<br>memory of his mean, cold bedroom and the grimy papers littered<br>under the aspidistra. He said abruptly:<br><br>'This writing business! What b--s it all is! Sitting in a corner<br>torturing a nerve which won't even respond any longer. And who<br>wants poetry nowadays? Training performing fleas would be more<br>useful by comparison.'<br><br>'Still, you oughtn't to let yourself be discouraged. After all,<br>you do produce something, which is more than one can say for a lot<br>of poets nowadays. There was Mice, for instance.'<br><br>'Oh, Mice! It makes me spew to think of it.'<br><br>He thought with loathing of that sneaky little foolscap octavo.<br>Those forty or fifty drab, dead little poems, each like a little<br>abortion in its labelled jar. 'Exceptional promise', The Times<br>Lit. Supp. had said. A hundred and fifty-three copies sold and the<br>rest remaindered. He had one of those movements of contempt and<br>even horror which every artist has at times when he thinks of his<br>own work.<br><br>'It's dead,' he said. 'Dead as a blasted foetus in a bottle.'<br><br>'Oh, well, I suppose that happens to most books. You can't<br>expect an enormous sale for poetry nowadays. There's too much<br>competition.'<br><br>'I didn't mean that. I meant the poems themselves are dead.<br>There's no life in them. Everything I write is like that.<br>Lifeless, gutless. Not necessarily ugly or vulgar; but dead--just<br>dead.' The word 'dead' re-echoed in his mind, setting up its own<br>train of thought. He added: 'My poems are dead because I'm dead.<br>You're dead. We're all dead. Dead people in a dead world.'<br><br>Ravelston murmured agreement, with a curious air of guilt. And now<br>they were off upon their favourite subject--Gordon's favourite<br>subject, anyway; the futility, the bloodiness, the deathliness of<br>modern life. They never met without talking for at least half an<br>hour in this vein. But it always made Ravelston feel rather<br>uncomfortable. In a way, of course, he knew--it was precisely this<br>that Antichrist existed to point out--that life under a decaying<br>capitalism is deathly and meaningless. But this knowledge was only<br>theoretical. You can't really feel that kind of thing when your<br>income is eight hundred a year. Most of the time, when he wasn't<br>thinking of coal-miners, Chinese junk-coolies, and the unemployed<br>in Middlesbrough, he felt that life was pretty good fun. Moreover,<br>he had the naive belief that in a little while Socialism is going<br>to put things right. Gordon always seemed to him to exaggerate.<br>So there was subtle disagreement between them, which Ravelston was<br>too good-mannered to press home.<br><br>But with Gordon it was different. Gordon's income was two pounds a<br>week. Therefore the hatred of modern life, the desire to see our<br>money-civilization blown to hell by bombs, was a thing he genuinely<br>felt. They were walking southward, down a darkish, meanly decent<br>residential street with a few shuttered shops. From a hoarding on<br>the blank end of a house the yard-wide face of Corner Table<br>simpered, pallid in the lamplight. Gordon caught a glimpse of a<br>withering aspidistra in a lower window. London! Mile after mile<br>of mean lonely houses, let off in flats and single rooms; not<br>homes, not communities, just clusters of meaningless lives drifting<br>in a sort of drowsy chaos to the grave! He saw men as corpses<br>walking. The thought that he was merely objectifying his own inner<br>misery hardly troubled him. His mind went back to Wednesday<br>afternoon, when he had desired to hear the enemy aeroplanes zooming<br>over London. He caught Ravelston's arm and paused to gesticulate<br>at the Corner Table poster.<br><br>'Look at that bloody thing up there! Look at it, just look at it!<br>Doesn't it make you spew?'<br><br>'It's aesthetically offensive, I grant. But I don't see that it<br>matters very greatly.'<br><br>'Of course it matters--having the town plastered with things like<br>that.'<br><br>'Oh, well, it's merely a temporary phenomenon. Capitalism in its<br>last phase. I doubt whether it's worth worrying about.'<br><br>'But there's more in it than that. Just look at that fellow's face<br>gaping down at us! You can see our whole civilization written<br>there. The imbecility, the emptiness, the desolation! You can't<br>look at it without thinking of French letters and machine guns. Do<br>you know that the other day I was actually wishing war would break<br>out? I was longing for it--praying for it, almost.'<br><br>'Of course, the trouble is, you see, that about half the young men<br>in Europe are wishing the same thing.'<br><br>'Let's hope they are. Then perhaps it'll happen.'<br><br>'My dear old chap, no! Once is enough, surely.'<br><br>Gordon walked on, fretfully. 'This life we live nowadays! It's<br>not life, it's stagnation, death-in-life. Look at all these bloody<br>houses, and the meaningless people inside them! Sometimes I think<br>we're all corpses. Just rotting upright.'<br><br>'But where you make your mistake, don't you see, is in talking as<br>if all this was incurable. This is only something that's got to<br>happen before the proletariat take over.'<br><br>'Oh, Socialism! Don't talk to me about Socialism.'<br><br>'You ought to read Marx, Gordon, you really ought. Then you'd<br>realize that this is only a phase. It can't go on for ever.'<br><br>'Can't it? It FEELS as if it was going on for ever.'<br><br>'It's merely that we're at a bad moment. We've got to die before<br>we can be reborn, if you take my meaning.'<br><br>'We're dying right enough. I don't see much signs of our being<br>reborn.'<br><br>Ravelston rubbed his nose. 'Oh, well, we must have faith, I<br>suppose. And hope.'<br><br>'We must have money you mean,' said Gordon gloomily.<br><br>'Money?'<br><br>'It's the price of optimism. Give me five quid a week and I'D be a<br>Socialist, I dare say.'<br><br>Ravelston looked away, discomforted. This money-business!<br>Everywhere it came up against you! Gordon wished he had not said<br>it. Money is the one thing you must never mention when you are<br>with people richer than yourself. Or if you do, then it must be<br>money in the abstract, money with a big 'M', not the actual<br>concrete money that's in your pocket and isn't in mine. But the<br>accursed subject drew him like a magnet. Sooner or later,<br>especially when he had a few drinks inside him, he invariably began<br>talking with self-pitiful detail about the bloodiness of life on<br>two quid a week. Sometimes, from sheer nervous impulse to say the<br>wrong thing, he would come out with some squalid confession--as,<br>for instance, that he had been without tobacco for two days, or<br>that his underclothes were in holes and his overcoat up the spout.<br>But nothing of that sort should happen tonight, he resolved. They<br>veered swiftly away from the subject of money and began talking in<br>a more general way about Socialism. Ravelston had been trying for<br>years to convert Gordon to Socialism, without even succeeding in<br>interesting him in it. Presently they passed a low-looking pub on<br>a corner in a side-street. A sour cloud of beer seemed to hang<br>about it. The smell revolted Ravelston. He would have quickened<br>his pace to get away from it. But Gordon paused, his nostrils<br>tickled.<br><br>'Christ! I could do with a drink,' he said.<br><br>'So could I,' said Ravelston gallantly.<br><br>Gordon shoved open the door of the public bar, Ravelston following.<br>Ravelston persuaded himself that he was fond of pubs, especially<br>low-class pubs. Pubs are genuinely proletarian. In a pub you can<br>meet the working class on equal terms--or that's the theory,<br>anyway. But in practice Ravelston never went into a pub unless he<br>was with somebody like Gordon, and he always felt like a fish out<br>of water when he got there. A foul yet coldish air enveloped them.<br>It was a filthy, smoky room, low-ceilinged, with a sawdusted floor<br>and plain deal tables ringed by generations of beer-pots. In one<br>corner four monstrous women with breasts the size of melons were<br>sitting drinking porter and talking with bitter intensity about<br>someone called Mrs Croop. The landlady, a tall grim woman with a<br>black fringe, looking like the madame of a brothel, stood behind<br>the bar, her powerful forearms folded, watching a game of darts<br>which was going on between four labourers and a postman. You had<br>to duck under the darts as you crossed the room, there was a<br>moment's hush and people glanced inquisitively at Ravelston. He<br>was so obviously a gentleman. They didn't see his type very often<br>in the public bar.<br><br>Ravelston pretended not to notice that they were staring at him.<br>He lounged towards the bar, pulling off a glove to feel for the<br>money in his pocket. 'What's yours?' he said casually.<br><br>But Gordon had already shoved his way ahead and was tapping a<br>shilling on the bar. Always pay for the first round of drinks! It<br>was his point of honour. Ravelston made for the only vacant table.<br>A navvy leaning on the bar turned on his elbow and gave him a long,<br>insolent stare 'A ---- toff!' he was thinking. Gordon came back<br>balancing two pint glasses of the dark common ale. They were thick<br>cheap glasses, thick as jam jars almost, and dim and greasy. A<br>thin yellow froth was subsiding on the beer. The air was thick<br>with gunpowdery tobacco-smoke. Ravelston caught sight of a well-<br>filled spittoon near the bar and averted his eyes. It crossed his<br>mind that this beer had been sucked up from some beetle-ridden<br>cellar through yards of slimy tube, and that the glasses had never<br>been washed in their lives, only rinsed in beery water. Gordon was<br>very hungry. He could have done with some bread and cheese, but to<br>order any would have been to betray the fact that he had had no<br>dinner. He took a deep pull at his beer and lighted a cigarette,<br>which made him forget his hunger a little. Ravelston also<br>swallowed a mouthful or so and set his glass gingerly down. It was<br>typical London beer, sickly and yet leaving a chemical after-taste.<br>Ravelston thought of the wines of Burgundy. They went on arguing<br>about Socialism.<br><br>'You know, Gordon, it's really time you started reading Marx,' said<br>Ravelston, less apologetically than usual, because the vile taste<br>of the beer had annoyed him.<br><br>'I'd sooner read Mrs Humphry Ward,' said Gordon.<br><br>'But don't you see, your attitude is so unreasonable. You're<br>always tirading against Capitalism, and yet you won't accept the<br>only possible alternative. One can't put things right in a hole-<br>and-corner way. One's got to accept either Capitalism or<br>Socialism. There's no way out of it.'<br><br>'I tell you I can't be bothered with Socialism. The very thought<br>of it makes me yawn.'<br><br>'But what's your objection to Socialism, anyway?'<br><br>'There's only one objection to Socialism, and that is that nobody<br>wants it.'<br><br>'Oh, surely it's rather absurd to say that!'<br><br>'That's to say, nobody who could see what Socialism would really<br>mean.'<br><br>'But what WOULD Socialism mean, according to your idea of it?'<br><br>'Oh! Some kind of Aldous Huxley Brave New World: only not so<br>amusing. Four hours a day in a model factory, tightening up bolt<br>number 6003. Rations served out in grease-proof paper at the<br>communal kitchen. Community-hikes from Marx Hostel to Lenin Hostel<br>and back. Free abortion-clinics on all the corners. All very well<br>in its way, of course. Only we don' t want it.'<br><br>Ravelston sighed. Once a month, in Antichrist, he repudiated this<br>version of Socialism. 'Well, what DO we want, then?'<br><br>'God knows. All we know is what we don't want. That's what's<br>wrong with us nowadays. We're stuck, like Buridan's donkey. Only<br>there are three alternatives instead of two, and all three of them<br>make us spew. Socialism's only one of them.'<br><br>'And what are the other two?'<br><br>'Oh, I suppose suicide and the Catholic Church.'<br><br>Ravelston smiled, anticlerically shocked. 'The Catholic Church!<br>Do you consider that an alternative?'<br><br>'Well, it's a standing temptation to the intelligentsia, isn't it?'<br><br>'Not what _I_ should call the intelligentsia. Though there was<br>Eliot, of course,' Ravelston admitted.<br><br>'And there'll be plenty more, you bet. I dare say it's fairly cosy<br>under Mother Church's wing. A bit insanitary, of course--but you'd<br>feel safe there, anyway.'<br><br>Ravelston rubbed his nose reflectively. 'It seems to me that's<br>only another form of suicide.'<br><br>'In a way. But so's Socialism. At least it's a counsel of<br>despair. But I couldn't commit suicide, real suicide. It's too<br>meek and mild. I'm not going to give up my share of earth to<br>anyone else. I'd want to do in a few of my enemies first.'<br><br>Ravelston smiled again. 'And who are your enemies?'<br><br>'Oh, anyone with over five hundred a year.'<br><br>A momentary uncomfortable silence fell. Ravelston's income, after<br>payment of income tax, was probably two thousand a year. This was<br>the kind of thing Gordon was always saying. To cover the<br>awkwardness of the moment, Ravelston took up his glass, steeled<br>himself against the nauseous taste, and swallowed about two-thirds<br>of his beer--enough at any rate, to give the impression that he had<br>finished it.<br><br>'Drink up!' he said with would-be heartiness. 'It's time we had<br>the other half of that.'<br><br>Gordon emptied his glass and let Ravelston take it. He did not<br>mind letting Ravelston pay for the drinks now. He had paid the<br>first round and honour was satisfied. Ravelston walked self-<br>consciously to the bar. People began staring at him again as soon<br>as he stood up. The navvy, still leaning against the bar over his<br>untouched pot of beer, gazed at him with quiet insolence.<br>Ravelston resolved that he would drink no more of this filthy<br>common ale.<br><br>'Two double whiskies, would you, please?' he said apologetically.<br><br>The grim landlady stared. 'What?' she said.<br><br>'Two double whiskies, please.'<br><br>'No whisky 'ere. We don't sell spirits. Beer 'ouse, we are.'<br><br>The navvy smiled flickering under his moustache. '---- ignorant<br>toff!' he was thinking. 'Asking for a whisky in a ---- beer<br>'ouse!' Ravelston's pale face flushed slightly. He had not known<br>till this moment that some of the poorer pubs cannot afford a<br>spirit licence.<br><br>'Bass, then, would you? Two pint bottles of Bass.'<br><br>There were no pint bottles, they had to have four half pints. It<br>was a very poor house. Gordon took a deep, satisfying swallow of<br>Bass. More alcoholic than the draught beer, it fizzed and prickled<br>in his throat, and because he was hungry it went a little to his<br>head. He felt at once more philosophic and more self-pitiful. He<br>had made up his mind not to begin belly-aching about his poverty;<br>but now he was going to begin after all. He said abruptly:<br><br>'This is all b--s that we've been talking.'<br><br>'What's all b--s?'<br><br>'All this about Socialism and Capitalism and the state of the<br>modern world and God knows what. I don't give a ---- for the state<br>of the modern world. If the whole of England was starving except<br>myself and the people I care about, I wouldn't give a damn.'<br><br>'Don't you exaggerate just a little?'<br><br>'No. All this talk we make--we're only objectifying our own<br>feelings. It's all dictated by what we've got in our pockets.<br>I go up and down London saying it's a city of the dead, and our<br>civilization's dying, and I wish war would break out, and God knows<br>what; and all it means is that my wages are two quid a week and I<br>wish they were five.'<br><br>Ravelston, once again reminded obliquely of his income, stroked his<br>nose slowly with the knuckle of his left forefinger.<br><br>'Of course, I'm with you up to a point. After all, it's only<br>what Marx said. Every ideology is a reflection of economic<br>circumstances.'<br><br>'Ah, but you only understand it out of Marx! You don't know what<br>it means to have to crawl along on two quid a week. It isn't a<br>question of hardship--it's nothing so decent as hardship. It's the<br>bloody, sneaking, squalid meaness of it. Living alone for weeks on<br>end because when you've no money you've no friends. Calling<br>yourself a writer and never even producing anything because you're<br>always too washed out to write. It's a sort of filthy sub-world<br>one lives in. A sort of spiritual sewer.'<br><br>He had started now. They were never together long without Gordon<br>beginning to talk in this strain. It was the vilest manners. It<br>embarrassed Ravelston horribly. And yet somehow Gordon could not<br>help it. He had got to retail his troubles to somebody, and<br>Ravelston was the only person who understood. Poverty, like every<br>other dirty wound, has got to be exposed occasionally. He began to<br>talk in obscene detail of his life in Willowbed Road. He dilated<br>on the smell of slops and cabbage, the clotted sauce-bottles in the<br>dining-room, the vile food, the aspidistras. He described his<br>furtive cups of tea and his trick of throwing used tea-leaves down<br>the W.C. Ravelston, guilty and miserable, sat staring at his glass<br>and revolving it slowly between his hands. Against his right<br>breast he could feel, a square accusing shape, the pocket-book in<br>which, as he knew, eight pound notes and two ten-bob notes nestled<br>against his fat green cheque-book. How awful these details of<br>poverty are! Not that what Gordon was describing was real poverty.<br>It was at worst the fringe of poverty. But what of the real poor?<br>What of the unemployed in Middlesbrough, seven in a room on twenty-<br>five bob a week? When there are people living like that, how dare<br>one walk the world with pound notes and cheque-books in one's<br>pocket?<br><br>'It's bloody,' he murmured several times, impotently. In his heart<br>he wondered--it was his invariable reaction--whether Gordon would<br>accept a tenner if you offered to lend it to him.<br><br>They had another drink, which Ravelston again paid for, and went<br>out into the street. It was almost time to part. Gordon never<br>spent more than an hour or two with Ravelston. One's contacts with<br>rich people, like one's visits to high altitudes, must always be<br>brief. It was a moonless, starless night, with a damp wind<br>blowing. The night air, the beer, and the watery radiance of the<br>lamps induced in Gordon a sort of dismal clarity. He perceived<br>that it is quite impossible to explain to any rich person, even to<br>anyone so decent as Ravelston, the essential bloodiness of poverty.<br>For this reason it became all the more important to explain it. He<br>said suddenly:<br><br>'Have you read Chaucer's Man of Lawe's Tale?'<br><br>'The Man of Lawe's Tale? Not that I remember. What's it about?'<br><br>'I forget. I was thinking of the first six stanzas. Where he<br>talks about poverty. The way it gives everyone the right to stamp<br>on you! The way everyone WANTS to stamp on you! It makes people<br>HATE you, to know that you've no money. They insult you just for<br>the pleasure of insulting you and knowing that you can't hit back.'<br><br>Ravelston was pained. 'Oh, no, surely not! People aren't so bad<br>as all that.'<br><br>'Ah, but you don't know the things that happen!'<br><br>Gordon did not want to be told that 'people aren't so bad'. He<br>clung with a sort of painful joy to the notion that because he was<br>poor everyone must WANT to insult him. It fitted in with his<br>philosophy of life. And suddenly, with the feeling that he could<br>not stop himself, he was talking of the thing that had been<br>rankling in his mind for two days past--the snub he had had from<br>the Dorings on Thursday. He poured the whole story out quite<br>shamelessly. Ravelston was amazed. He could not understand what<br>Gordon was making such a fuss about. To be disappointed at missing<br>a beastly literary tea-party seemed to him absurd. He would not<br>have gone to a literary tea-party if you had paid him. Like all<br>rich people, he spent far more time in avoiding human society than<br>in seeking it. He interrupted Gordon:<br><br>'Really, you know, you ought not to take offence so easily. After<br>all, a thing like that doesn't really matter.'<br><br>'It isn't the thing itself that matters, it's the spirit behind it.<br>The way they snub you as a matter of course, just because you've<br>got no money.'<br><br>'But quite possibly it was all a mistake, or something. Why should<br>anyone want to snub you?'<br><br>'"If thou be poure, thy brother hateth thee,"' quoted Gordon<br>perversely.<br><br>Ravelston, deferential even to the opinions of the dead, rubbed his<br>nose. 'Does Chaucer say that? Then I'm afraid I disagree with<br>Chaucer. People don't hate you, exactly.'<br><br>'They do. And they're quite right to hate you. You ARE hateful.<br>It's like those ads for Listerine. "Why is he always alone?<br>Halitosis is ruining his career." Poverty is spiritual halitosis.'<br><br>Ravelston sighed. Undoubtedly Gordon was perverse. They walked<br>on, arguing, Gordon vehemently, Ravelston deprecatingly. Ravelston<br>was helpless against Gordon in an argument of this kind. He felt<br>that Gordon exaggerated, and yet he never liked to contradict him.<br>How could he? He was rich and Gordon was poor. And how can you<br>argue about poverty with someone who is genuinely poor?<br><br>'And then the way women treat you when you've no money!' Gordon<br>went on. 'That's another thing about this accursed money business--<br>women!'<br><br>Ravelston nodded rather gloomily. This sounded to him more<br>reasonable than what Gordon had been saying before. He thought of<br>Hermione Slater, his own girl. They had been lovers two years but<br>had never bothered to get married. It was 'too much fag', Hermione<br>always said. She was rich, of course, or rather her people were.<br>He thought of her shoulders, wide, smooth, and young, that seemed<br>to rise out of her clothes like a mermaid rising from the sea; and<br>her skin and hair, which were somehow warm and sleepy, like a<br>wheatfield in the sun. Hermione always yawned at the mention of<br>Socialism, and refused even to read Antichrist. 'Don't talk to me<br>about the lower classes,' she used to say. 'I hate them. They<br>SMELL.' And Ravelston adored her.<br><br>'Of course women ARE a difficulty,' he admitted.<br><br>'They're more than a difficulty, they're a bloody curse. That is,<br>if you've got no money. A woman hates the sight of you if you've<br>got no money.'<br><br>'I think that's putting it a little too strongly. Things aren't so<br>crude as all that.'<br><br>Gordon did not listen. 'What rot it is to talk about Socialism or<br>any other ism when women are what they are! The only thing a woman<br>ever wants is money; money for a house of her own and two babies<br>and Drage furniture and an aspidistra. The only sin they can<br>imagine is not wanting to grab money. No woman ever judges a man<br>by anything except his income. Of course she doesn't put it to<br>herself like that. She says he's SUCH A NICE man--meaning that<br>he's got plenty of money. And if you haven't got money you aren't<br>NICE. You're dishonoured, somehow. You've sinned. Sinned against<br>the aspidistra.'<br><br>'You talk a great deal about aspidistras,' said Ravelston.<br><br>'They're a dashed important subject,' said Gordon.<br><br>Ravelston rubbed his nose and looked away uncomfortably.<br><br>'Look here, Gordon, you don't mind my asking--have you got a girl<br>of your own?'<br><br>'Oh, Christ! don't speak of her!'<br><br>He began, nevertheless, to talk about Rosemary. Ravelston had<br>never met Rosemary. At this moment Gordon could not even remember<br>what Rosemary was like. He could not remember how fond he was of<br>her and she of him, how happy they always were together on the rare<br>occasions when they could meet, how patiently she put up with his<br>almost intolerable ways. He remembered nothing save that she would<br>not sleep with him and that it was now a week since she had even<br>written. In the dank night air, with beer inside him, he felt<br>himself a forlorn, neglected creature. Rosemary was 'cruel' to<br>him--that was how he saw it. Perversely, for the mere pleasure of<br>tormenting himself and making Ravelston uncomfortable, be began to<br>invent an imaginary character for Rosemary. He built up a picture<br>of her as a callous creature who was amused by him and yet half<br>despised him, who played with him and kept him at arm's length, and<br>who would nevertheless fall into his arms if only he had a little<br>more money. And Ravelston, who had never met Rosemary, did not<br>altogether disbelieve him. He broke in:<br><br>'But I say, Gordon, look here. This girl, Miss--Miss Waterlow, did<br>you say her name was?--Rosemary; doesn't she care for you at all,<br>really?'<br><br>Gordon's conscience pricked him, though not very deeply. He could<br>not say that Rosemary did not care for him.<br><br>'Oh, yes, she does care for me. In her own way, I dare say she<br>cares for me quite a lot. But not enough, don't you see. She<br>can't, while I've got no money. It's all money.'<br><br>'But surely money isn't so important as all that? After all, there<br>ARE other things.'<br><br>'What other things? Don't you see that a man's whole personality<br>is bound up with his income? His personality IS his income. How<br>can you be attractive to a girl when you've got no money? You<br>can't wear decent clothes, you can't take her out to dinner or to<br>the theatre or away for week-ends, you can't carry a cheery,<br>interesting atmosphere about with you. And it's rot to say that<br>kind of thing doesn't matter. It does. If you haven't got money<br>there isn't even anywhere where you can meet. Rosemary and I never<br>meet except in the streets or in picture galleries. She lives in<br>some foul women's hostel, and my bitch of a landlady won't allow<br>women in the house. Wandering up and down beastly wet streets--<br>that's what Rosemary associates me with. Don't you see how it<br>takes the gilt off everything?'<br><br>Ravelston was distressed. It must be pretty bloody when you<br>haven't even the money to take your girl out. He tried to nerve<br>himself to say something, and failed. With guilt, and also with<br>desire, he thought of Hermione's body, naked like a ripe warm<br>fruit. With any luck she would have dropped in at the flat this<br>evening. Probably she was waiting for him now. He thought of the<br>unemployed in Middlesbrough. Sexual starvation is awful among the<br>unemployed. They were nearing the flat. He glanced up at the<br>windows. Yes, they were lighted up. Hermione must be there. She<br>had her own latchkey.<br><br>As they approached the flat Gordon edged closer to Ravelston. Now<br>the evening was ending, and he must part from Ravelston, whom he<br>adored, and go back to his foul lonely bedroom. And all evenings<br>ended in this way; the return through the dark streets to the<br>lonely room, the womanless bed. And Ravelston would say 'Come up,<br>won't you?' and Gordon, in duty bound, would say, 'No.' Never stay<br>too long with those you love--another commandment of the moneyless.<br><br>They halted at the foot of the steps. Ravelston laid his gloved<br>hand on one of the iron spearheads of the railing.<br><br>'Come up, won't you?' he said without conviction.<br><br>'No, thanks. It's time I was getting back.'<br><br>Ravelston's fingers tightened round the spearhead. He pulled as<br>though to go up, but did not go. Uncomfortably, looking over<br>Gordon's head into the distance, he said:<br><br>'I say, Gordon, look here. You won't be offended if I say<br>something?'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'I say, you know, I hate that business about you and your girl.<br>Not being able to take her out, and all that. It's bloody, that<br>kind of thing.'<br><br>'Oh, it's nothing really.'<br><br>As soon as he heard Ravelston say that it was 'bloody', he knew<br>that he had been exaggerating. He wished that he had not talked in<br>that silly self-pitiful way. One says these things, with the<br>feeling that one cannot help saying them, and afterwards one is<br>sorry.<br><br>'I dare say I exaggerate,' he said.<br><br>'I say, Gordon, look here. Let me lend you ten quid. Take the<br>girl out to dinner a few times. Or away for the week-end, or<br>something. It might make all the difference. I hate to think--'<br><br>Gordon frowned bitterly, almost fiercely. He had stepped a pace<br>back, as though from a threat or an insult. The terrible thing was<br>that the temptation to say 'Yes' had almost overwhelmed him. There<br>was so much that ten quid would do! He had a fleeting vision of<br>Rosemary and himself at a restaurant table--a bowl of grapes and<br>peaches, a bowing hovering waiter, a wine bottle dark and dusty in<br>its wicker cradle.<br><br>'No fear!' he said.<br><br>'I do wish you would. I tell you I'd LIKE to lend it you.'<br><br>'Thanks. But I prefer to keep my friends.'<br><br>'Isn't that rather--well, rather a bourgeois kind of thing to say?'<br><br>'Do you think it would be BORROWING if I took ten quid off you? I<br>couldn't pay it back in ten years.'<br><br>'Oh, well! It wouldn't matter so very much.' Ravelston looked<br>away. Out it had got to come--the disgraceful, hateful admission<br>that he found himself forced so curiously often to make! 'You<br>know, I've got quite a lot of money.'<br><br>'I know you have. That's exactly why I won't borrow off you.'<br><br>'You know, Gordon, sometimes you're just a little bit--well,<br>pigheaded.'<br><br>'I dare say. I can't help it.'<br><br>'Oh, well! Good night, then.'<br><br>'Good night.'<br><br>Ten minutes later Ravelston rode southwards in a taxi, with<br>Hermione. She had been waiting for him, asleep or half asleep in<br>one of the monstrous armchairs in front of the sitting-room fire.<br>Whenever there was nothing particular to do, Hermione always fell<br>asleep as promptly as an animal, and the more she slept the<br>healthier she became. As he came across to her she woke and<br>stretched herself with voluptuous, sleepy writhings, half smiling,<br>half yawning up at him, one cheek and bare arm rosy in the<br>firelight. Presently she mastered her yawns to greet him:<br><br>'Hullo, Philip! Where have you been all this time? I've been<br>waiting ages.'<br><br>'Oh, I've been out with a fellow. Gordon Comstock. I don't expect<br>you know him. The poet.'<br><br>'Poet! How much did he borrow off you?'<br><br>'Nothing. He's not that kind of person. He's rather a fool about<br>money, as a matter of fact. But he's very gifted in his way.'<br><br>'You and your poets! You look tired, Philip. What time did you<br>have dinner?'<br><br>'Well--as a matter of fact I didn't have any dinner.'<br><br>'Didn't have any dinner! Why?'<br><br>'Oh, well, you see--I don't know if you'll understand. It was a<br>kind of accident. It was like this.'<br><br>He explained. Hermione burst out laughing and dragged herself into<br>a more upright position.<br><br>'Philip! You ARE a silly old ass! Going without your dinner, just<br>so as not to hurt that little beast's feelings! You must have some<br>food at once. And of course your char's gone home. Why don't you<br>keep some proper servants, Philip? I hate this hole-and-corner way<br>you live. We'll go out and have supper at Modigliani's.'<br><br>'But it's after ten. They'll be shut.'<br><br>'Nonsense! They're open till two. I'll ring up for a taxi. I'm<br>not going to have you starving yourself.'<br><br>In the taxi she lay against him, still half asleep, her head<br>pillowed on his breast. He thought of the unemployed in<br>Middlesbrough, seven in a room on twenty-five bob a week. But the<br>girl's body was heavy against him, and Middlesbrough was very far<br>away. Also he was damnably hungry. He thought of his favourite<br>corner table at Modigliani's, and of that vile pub with its hard<br>benches, stale beer-stink, and brass spittoons. Hermione was<br>sleepily lecturing him.<br><br>'Philip, why do you have to live in such a dreadful way?'<br><br>'But I don't live in a dreadful way.'<br><br>'Yes, you do. Pretending you're poor when you're not, and living<br>in that poky flat with no servants, and going about with all these<br>beastly people.'<br><br>'What beastly people?'<br><br>'Oh, people like this poet friend of yours. All those people who<br>write for your paper. They only do it to cadge from you. Of<br>course I know you're a Socialist. So am I. I mean we're all<br>Socialists nowadays. But I don't see why you have to give all your<br>money away and make friends with the lower classes. You can be a<br>Socialist AND have a good time, that's what I say.'<br><br>'Hermione, dear, please don't call them the lower classes!'<br><br>'Why not? They ARE the lower classes, aren't they?'<br><br>'It's such a hateful expression. Call them the working class,<br>can't you?'<br><br>'The working class, if you like, then. But they smell just the<br>same.'<br><br>'You oughtn't to say that kind of thing,' he protested weakly.<br><br>'Do you know, Philip, sometimes I think you LIKE the lower<br>classes.'<br><br>'Of course I like them.'<br><br>'How disgusting. How absolutely disgusting.'<br><br>She lay quiet, content to argue no longer, her arms round him, like<br>a sleepy siren. The woman-scent breathed out of her, a powerful<br>wordless propaganda against all altruism and all justice. Outside<br>Modigliani's they had paid off the taxi and were moving for the<br>door when a big, lank wreck of a man seemed to spring up from the<br>paving-stones in front of them. He stood across their path like<br>some fawning beast, with dreadful eagerness and yet timorously, as<br>though afraid that Ravelston would strike him. His face came close<br>up to Ravelston's--a dreadful face, fish-white and scrubby-bearded<br>to the eyes. The words 'A cup of tea, guv'nor!' were breathed<br>through carious teeth. Ravelston shrank from him in disgust. He<br>could not help it. His hand moved automatically to his pocket.<br>But in the same instant Hermione caught him by the arm and hauled<br>him inside the restaurant.<br><br>'You'd give away every penny you've got if I let you,' she said.<br><br>They went to their favourite table in the corner. Hermione played<br>with some grapes, but Ravelston was very hungry. He ordered the<br>grilled rumpsteak he had been thinking of, and half a bottle of<br>Beaujolais. The fat, white-haired Italian waiter, an old friend of<br>Ravelston's, brought the smoking steak. Ravelston cut it open.<br>Lovely, its red-blue heart! In Middlesbrough the unemployed huddle<br>in frowzy beds, bread and marg and milkless tea in their bellies.<br>He settled down to his steak with all the shameful joy of a dog<br>with a stolen leg of mutton.<br><br>Gordon walked rapidly homewards. It was cold. The fifth of<br>December--real winter now. Circumcise ye your foreskins, saith the<br>Lord. The damp wind blew spitefully through the naked trees.<br>Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over. The poem he had begun on<br>Wednesday, of which six stanzas were now finished, came back to his<br>mind. He did not dislike it at this moment. It was queer how<br>talking with Ravelston always bucked him up. The mere contact with<br>Ravelston seemed to reassure him somehow. Even when their talk had<br>been unsatisfactory, he came away with the feeling that, after all,<br>he wasn't quite a failure. Half aloud he repeated the six finished<br>stanzas. They were not bad, not bad at all.<br><br>But intermittently he was going over in his mind the things he had<br>said to Ravelston. He stuck to everything he had said. The<br>humiliation of poverty! That's what they can't understand and<br>won't understand. Not hardship--you don't suffer hardship on two<br>quid a week, and if you did it wouldn't matter--but just<br>humiliation, the awful, bloody humiliation. The way it gives<br>everyone the right to stamp on you. The way everyone WANTS to<br>stamp on you. Ravelston wouldn't believe it. He had too much<br>decency, that was why. He thought you could be poor and still be<br>treated like a human being. But Gordon knew better. He went into<br>the house repeating to himself that he knew better.<br><br>There was a letter waiting for him on the hall tray. His heart<br>jumped. All letters excited him nowadays. He went up the stairs<br>three at a time, shut himself in and lit the gas. The letter was<br>from Doring.<br><br><br>DEAR COMSTOCK,--What a pity you didn't turn up on Saturday. There<br>were some people I wanted you to meet. We did tell you it was<br>Saturday and not Thursday this time, didn't we? My wife says she's<br>certain she told you. Anyway, we're having another party on the<br>twenty-third, a sort of before-Christmas party, about the same<br>time. Won't you come then? Don't forget the date this time.<br><br>Yours<br><br>PAUL DORING<br><br><br>A painful convulsion happened below Gordon's ribs. So Doring was<br>pretending that it was all a mistake--was pretending not to have<br>insulted him! True, he could not actually have gone there on<br>Saturday, because on Saturday he had to be at the shop; still, it<br>was the intention that counted.<br><br>His heart sickened as he re-read the words 'some people I wanted<br>you to meet'. Just like his bloody luck! He thought of the people<br>he might have met--editors of highbrow magazines, for instance.<br>They might have given him books to review or asked to see his poems<br>or Lord knew what. For a moment he was dreadfully tempted to<br>believe that Doring had spoken the truth. Perhaps after all they<br>HAD told him it was Saturday and not Thursday. Perhaps if he<br>searched his memory he might remember about it--might even find the<br>letter itself lying among his muddle of papers. But no! He<br>wouldn't think of it. He fought down the temptation. The Dorings<br>HAD insulted him on purpose. He was poor, therefore they had<br>insulted him. If you are poor, people will insult you. It was his<br>creed. Stick to it!<br><br>He went across to the table, tearing Doring's letter into small<br>bits. The aspidistra stood in its pot, dull green, ailing,<br>pathetic in its sickly ugliness. As he sat down, he pulled it<br>towards him and looked at it meditatively. There was the intimacy<br>of hatred between the aspidistra and him. 'I'll beat you yet, you<br>b--,' he whispered to the dusty leaves.<br><br>Then he rummaged among his papers until he found a clean sheet,<br>took his pen and wrote in his small, neat hand, right in the middle<br>of the sheet:<br><br><br>DEAR DORING,--With reference to your letter: Go and ---- yourself.<br><br>Yours truly<br><br>GORDON COMSTOCK<br><br><br>He stuck it into an envelope, addressed it, and at once went out to<br>get stamps from the slot machine. Post it tonight: these things<br>look different in the morning. He dropped it into the pillar-box.<br>So there was another friend gone west. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/4.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/6.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
