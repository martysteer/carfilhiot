<h2>Chapter 8</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">As the clock struck one Gordon slammed the shop door to and<br>hurried, almost ran, to the branch of the Westminster Bank down the<br>street.<br><br>With a half-conscious gesture of caution he was clutching the lapel<br>of his coat, holding it tight against him. In there, stowed away<br>in his right-hand inner pocket, was an object whose very existence<br>he partly doubted. It was a stout blue envelope with an American<br>stamp; in the envelope was a cheque for fifty dollars; and the<br>cheque was made out to 'Gordon Comstock'!<br><br>He could feel the square shape of the envelope outlined against his<br>body as clearly as though it had been red hot. All the morning he<br>had felt it there, whether he touched it or whether he did not; he<br>seemed to have developed a special patch of sensitiveness in the<br>skin below his right breast. As often as once in ten minutes he<br>had taken the cheque out of its envelope and anxiously examined it.<br>After all, cheques are tricky things. It would be frightful if<br>there turned out to be some hitch about the date or the signature.<br>Besides, he might lose it--it might even vanish of its own accord<br>like fairy gold.<br><br>The cheque had come from the Californian Review, that American<br>magazine to which, weeks or months ago, he had despairingly sent a<br>poem. He had almost forgotten about the poem, it had been so long<br>away, until this morning their letter had come sailing out of the<br>blue. And what a letter! No English editor ever writes letters<br>like that. They were 'very favorably impressed' by his poem. They<br>would 'endeavor' to include it in their next number. Would he<br>'favor' them by showing them some more of his work? (Would he?<br>Oh, boy!--as Flaxman would say.) And the cheque had come with it.<br>It seemed the most monstrous folly, in this year of blight 1934,<br>that anyone should pay fifty dollars for a poem. However, there<br>it was; and there was the cheque, which looked perfectly genuine<br>however often he inspected it.<br><br>He would have no peace of mind till the cheque was cashed--for<br>quite possibly the bank would refuse it--but already a stream of<br>visions was flowing through his mind. Visions of girls' faces,<br>visions of cobwebby claret bottles and quart pots of beer, visions<br>of a new suit and his overcoat out of pawn, visions of a week-end<br>at Brighton with Rosemary, visions of the crisp, crackling five<br>pound note which he was going to give to Julia. Above all, of<br>course, that fiver for Julia. It was almost the first thing he had<br>thought of when the cheque came. Whatever else he did with the<br>money, he must give Julia half of it. It was only the barest<br>justice, considering how much he had 'borrowed' from her in all<br>these years. All the morning the thought of Julia and the money he<br>owed her had been cropping up in his mind at odd moments. It was a<br>vaguely distasteful thought, however. He would forget about it for<br>half an hour at a time, would plan a dozen ways of spending his ten<br>pounds to the uttermost farthing, and then suddenly he would<br>remember about Julia. Good old Julia! Julia should have her<br>share. A fiver at the very least. Even that was not a tenth of<br>what he owed her. For the twentieth time, with a faint malaise, he<br>registered the thought: five quid for Julia.<br><br>The bank made no trouble about the cheque. Gordon had no banking<br>account, but they knew him well, for Mr McKechnie banked there.<br>They had cashed editors' cheques for Gordon before. There was only<br>a minute's consultation, and then the cashier came back.<br><br>'Notes, Mr Comstock?'<br><br>'One five pound, and the rest pounds, please.'<br><br>The flimsy luscious fiver and the five clean pound notes slid<br>rustling under the brass rail. And after them the cashier pushed a<br>little pile of half-crowns and pennies. In lordly style Gordon<br>shot the coins into his pocket without even counting them. That<br>was a bit of backsheesh. He had only expected ten pounds for fifty<br>dollars. The dollar must be above par. The five pound note,<br>however, he carefully folded up and stowed away in the American<br>envelope. That was Julia's fiver. It was sacrosanct. He would<br>post it to her presently.<br><br>He did not go home for dinner. Why chew leathery beef in the<br>aspidistral dining-room when he had ten quid in pocket--five quid,<br>rather? (He kept forgetting that half the money was already<br>mortgaged to Julia.) For the moment he did not bother to post<br>Julia's five pounds. This evening would be soon enough. Besides,<br>he rather enjoyed the feeling of it in his pocket. It was queer<br>how different you felt with all that money in your pocket. Not<br>opulent, merely, but reassured, revivified, reborn. He felt a<br>different person from what he had been yesterday. He WAS a<br>different person. He was no longer the downtrodden wretch who made<br>secret cups of tea over the oil stove at 31 Willowbed Road. He was<br>Gordon Comstock, the poet, famous on both sides of the Atlantic.<br>Publications: Mice (1932), London Pleasures (1935). He thought<br>with perfect confidence of London Pleasures now. In three months<br>it should see the light. Demy octavo, white buckram covers. There<br>was nothing that he did not feel equal to now that his luck had<br>turned.<br><br>He strolled into the Prince of Wales for a bite of food. A cut<br>off the joint and two veg., one and twopence, a pint of pale ale<br>ninepence, twenty Gold Flakes a shilling. Even after that<br>extravagance he still had well over ten pounds in hand--or rather,<br>well over five pounds. Beer-warmed, he sat and meditated on the<br>things you can do with five pounds. A new suit, a week-end in the<br>country, a day-trip to Paris, five rousing drunks, ten dinners in<br>Soho restaurants. At this point it occurred to him that he and<br>Rosemary and Ravelston must certainly have dinner together tonight.<br>Just to celebrate his stroke of luck; after all, it isn't every day<br>that ten pounds--five pounds--drops out of the sky into your lap.<br>The thought of the three of them together, with good food and wine<br>and money no object took hold of him as something not to be<br>resisted. He had just a tiny twinge of caution. Mustn't spend ALL<br>his money, of course. Still, he could afford a quid--two quid. In<br>a couple of minutes he had got Ravelston on the pub phone.<br><br>'Is that you, Ravelston? I say, Ravelston! Look here, you've got<br>to have dinner with me tonight.'<br><br>From the other end of the line Ravelston faintly demurred. 'No,<br>dash it! You have dinner with ME.' But Gordon overbore him.<br>Nonsense! Ravelston had got to have dinner with HIM tonight.<br>Unwillingly, Ravelston assented. All right, yes, thanks; he'd like<br>it very much. There was a sort of apologetic misery in his voice.<br>He guessed what had happened. Gordon had got hold of money from<br>somewhere and was squandering it immediately; as usual, Ravelston<br>felt he hadn't the right to interfere. Where should they go?<br>Gordon was demanding. Ravelston began to speak in praise of those<br>jolly little Soho restaurants where you get such a wonderful dinner<br>for half a crown. But the Soho restaurants sounded beastly as soon<br>as Ravelston mentioned them. Gordon wouldn't hear of it. Nonsense!<br>They must go somewhere decent. Let's do it all regardless, was his<br>private thought; might as well spend two quid--three quid, even.<br>Where did Ravelston generally go? Modigliani's, admitted Ravelston.<br>But Modigliani's was very--but no! not even over the phone could<br>Ravelston frame that hateful word 'expensive'. How remind Gordon<br>of his poverty? Gordon mightn't care for Modigliani's, he<br>euphemistically said. But Gordon was satisfied. Modigliani's?<br>Right you are--half past eight. Good! After all, if he spent even<br>three quid on the dinner he'd still have two quid to buy himself a<br>new pair of shoes and a vest and a pair of pants.<br><br>He had fixed it up with Rosemary in another five minutes. The New<br>Albion did not like their employees being rung up on the phone, but<br>it did not matter once in a way. Since that disastrous Sunday<br>journey, five days ago, he had heard from her once but had not seen<br>her. She answered eagerly when she heard whose voice it was.<br>Would she have dinner with him tonight? Of course! What fun!<br>And so in ten minutes the whole thing was settled. He had always<br>wanted Rosemary and Ravelston to meet, but somehow had never been<br>able to contrive it. These things are so much easier when you've<br>got a little money to spend.<br><br>The taxi bore him westward through the darkling streets. A three-<br>mile journey--still, he could afford it. Why spoil the ship for a<br>ha'porth of tar? He had dropped that notion of spending only two<br>pounds tonight. He would spend three pounds, three pounds ten--<br>four pounds if he felt like it. Slap up and regardless--that was<br>the idea. And, oh! by the way! Julia's fiver. He hadn't sent it<br>yet. No matter. Send it first thing in the morning. Good old<br>Julia! She should have her fiver.<br><br>How voluptuous were the taxi cushions under his bum! He lolled<br>this way and that. He had been drinking, of course--had had two<br>quick ones, or possibly three, before coming away. The taxi-driver<br>was a stout philosophic man with a weather-beaten face and a<br>knowing eye. He and Gordon understood one another. They had<br>palled up in the bar where Gordon was having his quick ones. As<br>they neared the West End the taximan drew up, unbidden, at a<br>discreet pub on a corner. He knew what was in Gordon's mind.<br>Gordon could do with a quick one. So could the taximan. But the<br>drinks were on Gordon--that too was understood.<br><br>'You anticipated my thoughts,' said Gordon, climbing out.<br><br>'Yes, sir.'<br><br>'I could just about do with a quick one.'<br><br>'Thought you might, sir.'<br><br>'And could you manage one yourself, do you think?'<br><br>'Where there's a will there's a way,' said the taximan.<br><br>'Come inside,' said Gordon.<br><br>They leaned matily on the brass-edged bar, elbow to elbow, lighting<br>two of the taximan's cigarettes. Gordon felt witty and expansive.<br>He would have liked to tell the taximan the history of his life.<br>The white-aproned barman hastened towards them.<br><br>'Yes sir?' said the barman.<br><br>'Gin,' said Gordon.<br><br>'Make it two,' said the taximan.<br><br>More matily than ever, they clinked glasses.<br><br>'Many happy returns,' said Gordon.<br><br>'Your birthday today, sir?'<br><br>'Only metaphorically. My re-birthday, so to speak.'<br><br>'I never had much education,' said the taximan.<br><br>'I was speaking in parables,' said Gordon.<br><br>'English is good enough for me,' said the taximan.<br><br>'It was the tongue of Shakespeare,' said Gordon.<br><br>'Literary gentleman, are you, sir, by any chance?'<br><br>'Do I look as moth-eaten as all that?'<br><br>'Not moth-eaten, sir. Only intellectual-like.'<br><br>'You're quite right. A poet.'<br><br>'Poet! It takes all sorts to make a world, don't it now?' said the<br>taximan.<br><br>'And a bloody good world it is,' said Gordon.<br><br>His thoughts moved lyrically tonight. They had another gin and<br>presently went back to the taxi all but arm in arm, after yet<br>another gin. That made five gins Gordon had had this evening.<br>There was an ethereal feeling in his veins; the gin seemed to be<br>flowing there, mingled with his blood. He lay back in the corner<br>of the seat, watching the great blazing skysigns swim across the<br>bluish dark. The evil red and blue of the Neon lights pleased him<br>at this moment. How smoothly the taxi glided! More like a gondola<br>than a car. It was having money that did that. Money greased the<br>wheels. He thought of the evening ahead of him; good food, good<br>wine, good talk--above all, no worrying about money. No damned<br>niggling with sixpences and 'We can't afford this' and 'We can't<br>afford that!' Rosemary and Ravelston would try to stop him being<br>extravagant. But he would shut them up. He'd spend every penny he<br>had if he felt like it. Ten whole quid to bust! At least, five<br>quid. The thought of Julia passed flickeringly through his mind<br>and disappeared again.<br><br>He was quite sober when they got to Modigliani's. The monstrous<br>commissionaire, like a great glittering waxwork with the minimum of<br>joints, stepped stiffly forward to open the taxi door. His grim<br>eye looked askance at Gordon's clothes. Not that you were expected<br>to 'dress' at Modigliani's. They were tremendously Bohemian at<br>Modigliani's, of course; but there are ways and ways of being<br>Bohemian, and Gordon's way was the wrong way. Gordon did not care.<br>He bade the taximan an affectionate farewell, and tipped him half a<br>crown over his fare, whereat the commissionaire's eye looked a<br>little less grim. At this moment Ravelston emerged from the<br>doorway. The commissionaire knew Ravelston, of course. He lounged<br>out on to the pavement, a tall distinguished figure, aristocratically<br>shabby, his eye rather moody. He was worrying already about the<br>money this dinner was going to cost Gordon.<br><br>'Ah, there you are, Gordon!'<br><br>'Hullo, Ravelston! Where's Rosemary?'<br><br>'Perhaps she's waiting inside. I don't know her by sight, you<br>know. But I say, Gordon, look here! Before we go in, I wanted--'<br><br>'Ah, look, there she is!'<br><br>She was coming towards them, swift and debonair. She threaded her<br>way through the crowd with the air of some neat little destroyer<br>gliding between large clumsy cargo-boats. And she was nicely<br>dressed, as usual. The sub-shovel hat was cocked at its most<br>provocative angle. Gordon's heart stirred. There was a girl for<br>you! He was proud that Ravelston should see her. She was very gay<br>tonight. It was written all over her that she was not going to<br>remind herself or Gordon of their last disastrous encounter.<br>Perhaps she laughed and talked just a little too vivaciously as<br>Gordon introduced them and they went inside. But Ravelston had<br>taken a liking to her immediately. Indeed, everyone who met her<br>did take a liking to Rosemary. The inside of the restaurant<br>overawed Gordon for a moment. It was so horribly, artistically<br>smart. Dark gate-leg tables, pewter candlesticks, pictures by<br>modern French painters on the walls. One, a street scene, looked<br>like a Utrillo. Gordon stiffened his shoulders. Damn it, what was<br>there to be afraid of? The five pound note was tucked away in its<br>envelope in his pocket. It was Julia's five pounds, of course;<br>he wasn't going to spend it. Still, its presence gave him moral<br>support. It was a kind of talisman. They were making for the<br>corner table--Ravelston's favourite table--at the far end.<br>Ravelston took Gordon by the arm and drew him a little back,<br>out of Rosemary's hearing.<br><br>'Gordon, look here!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Look here, you're going to have dinner with ME tonight.'<br><br>'Bosh! This is on me.'<br><br>'I do wish you would. I hate to see you spending all that money.'<br><br>'We won't talk about money tonight,' said Gordon.<br><br>'Fifty-fifty, then,' pleaded Ravelston.<br><br>'It's on me,' said Gordon firmly.<br><br>Ravelston subsided. The fat, white-haired Italian waiter was<br>bowing and smiling beside the corner table. But it was at<br>Ravelston, not at Gordon, that he smiled. Gordon sat down with the<br>feeling that he must assert himself quickly. He waved away the<br>menu which the waiter had produced.<br><br>'We must settle what we're going to drink first,' he said.<br><br>'Beer for me,' said Ravelston, with a sort of gloomy haste.<br>'Beer's the only drink I care about.'<br><br>'Me too,' echoed Rosemary.<br><br>'Oh, rot! We've got to have some wine. What do you like, red or<br>white? Give me the wine list,' he said to the waiter.<br><br>'Then let's have a plain Bordeaux. Medoc or St Julien or<br>something,' said Ravelston.<br><br>'I adore St Julien,' said Rosemary, who thought she remembered that<br>St Julien was always the cheapest wine on the list.<br><br>Inwardly, Gordon damned their eyes. There you are, you see! They<br>were in league against him already. They were trying to prevent<br>him from spending his money. There was going to be that deadly,<br>hateful atmosphere of 'You can't afford it' hanging over everything.<br>It made him all the more anxious to be extravagant. A moment ago he<br>would have compromised on Burgundy. Now he decided that they must<br>have something really expensive--something fizzy, something with a<br>kick in it. Champagne? No, they'd never let him have champagne.<br>Ah!<br><br>'Have you got any Asti?' he said to the waiter.<br><br>The waiter suddenly beamed, thinking of his corkage. He had<br>grasped now that Gordon and not Ravelston was the host. He<br>answered in the peculiar mixture of French and English which he<br>affected.<br><br>'Asti, sir? Yes, sir. Very nice Asti! Asti Spumanti. Tres fin!<br>Tres vif!'<br><br>Ravelston's worried eye sought Gordon's across the table. You<br>can't afford it! his eye pleaded.<br><br>'Is that one of those fizzy wines?' said Rosemary.<br><br>'Very fizzy, madame. Very lively wine. Tres vif! Pop!' His fat<br>hands made a gesture, picturing cascades of foam.<br><br>'Asti,' said Gordon, before Rosemary could stop him<br><br>Ravelston looked miserable. He knew that Asti would cost Gordon<br>ten or fifteen shillings a bottle. Gordon pretended not to notice.<br>He began talking about Stendhal--association with Duchesse de<br>Sanseverina and her 'force vin d'Asti'. Along came the Asti in a<br>pail of ice--a mistake, that, as Ravelston could have told Gordon.<br>Out came the cork. Pop! The wild wine foamed into the wide flat<br>glasses. Mysteriously the atmosphere of the table changed.<br>Something had happened to all three of them. Even before it was<br>drunk the wine had worked its magic. Rosemary had lost her<br>nervousness, Ravelston his worried preoccupation with the expense,<br>Gordon his defiant resolve to be extravagant. They were eating<br>anchovies and bread and butter, fried sole, roast pheasant with<br>bread sauce and chipped potatoes; but principally they were<br>drinking and talking. And how brilliantly they were talking--or so<br>it seemed to them, anyway! They talked about the bloodiness of<br>modern life and the bloodiness of modern books. What else is there<br>to talk about nowadays? As usual (but, oh! how differently, now<br>that there was money in his pocket and he didn't really believe<br>what he was saying) Gordon descanted on the deadness, the<br>dreadfulness of the age we live in. French letters and machine-<br>guns! The movies and the Daily Mail! It was a bone-deep truth<br>when he walked the streets with a couple of coppers in his pocket;<br>but it was a joke at this moment. It was great fun--it IS fun when<br>you have good food and good wine inside you--to demonstrate that we<br>live in a dead and rotting world. He was being witty at the<br>expense of the modern literature; they were all being witty. With<br>the fine scorn of the unpublished Gordon knocked down reputation<br>after reputation. Shaw, Yeats, Eliot, Joyce, Huxley, Lewis,<br>Hemingway--each with a careless phrase or two was shovelled into<br>the dustbin. What fun it all was, if only it could last! And of<br>course, at this particular moment, Gordon believed that it COULD<br>last. Of the first bottle of Asti, Gordon drank three glasses,<br>Ravelston two, and Rosemary one. Gordon became aware that a girl<br>at the table opposite was watching him. A tall elegant girl with a<br>shell-pink skin and wonderful, almond-shaped eyes. Rich, obviously;<br>one of the moneyed intelligentsia. She thought him interesting--was<br>wondering who he was. Gordon found himself manufacturing special<br>witticisms for her benefit. And he WAS being witty, there was no<br>doubt about that. That too was money. Money greasing the wheels--<br>wheels of thought as well as wheels of taxis.<br><br>But somehow the second bottle of Asti was not such a success as<br>the first. To begin with there was uncomfortableness over its<br>ordering. Gordon beckoned to the waiter.<br><br>'Have you got another bottle of this?'<br><br>The waiter beamed fatly. 'Yes, sir! Mais certainement, monsieur!'<br><br>Rosemary frowned and tapped Gordon's foot under the table. 'No,<br>Gordon, NO! You're not to.'<br><br>'Not to what?'<br><br>'Order another bottle. We don't want it.'<br><br>'Oh, bosh! Get another bottle, waiter.'<br><br>'Yes, sir.'<br><br>Ravelston rubbed his nose. With eyes too guilty to meet Gordon's<br>he looked at his wine glass. 'Look here, Gordon. Let ME stand<br>this bottle. I'd like to.'<br><br>'Bosh!' repeated Gordon.<br><br>'Get half a bottle, then,' said Rosemary.<br><br>'A whole bottle, waiter,' said Gordon.<br><br>After that nothing was the same. They still talked, laughed,<br>argued, but things were not the same. The elegant girl at the<br>table opposite had ceased watching Gordon. Somehow, Gordon wasn't<br>being witty any longer. It is almost always a mistake to order a<br>second bottle. It is like bathing for a second time on a summer<br>day. However warm the day is, however much you have enjoyed your<br>first bathe, you are always sorry for it if you go in a second<br>time. The magic had departed from the wine. It seemed to foam and<br>sparkle less, it was merely a clogging sourish liquid which you<br>gulped down half in disgust and half in hopes of getting drunk<br>quicker. Gordon was now definitely though secretly drunk. One<br>half of him was drunk and the other half sober. He was beginning<br>to have that peculiar blurred feeling, as though your features had<br>swollen and your fingers grown thicker, which you have in the<br>second stage of drunkenness. But the sober half of him was still<br>in command to outward appearance, anyway. The conversation grew<br>more and more tedious. Gordon and Ravelston talked in the detached<br>uncomfortable manner of people who have had a little scene and are<br>not going to admit it. They talked about Shakespeare. The<br>conversation tailed off into a long discussion about the meaning<br>of Hamlet. It was very dull. Rosemary stifled a yawn. While<br>Gordon's sober half talked, his drunken half stood aside and<br>listened. Drunken half was very angry. They'd spoiled his<br>evening, damn them! with their arguing about that second bottle.<br>All he wanted now was to be properly drunk and have done with it.<br>Of the six glasses in the second bottle he drank four--for Rosemary<br>refused more wine. But you couldn't do much on this weak stuff.<br>Drunken half clamoured for more drink, and more, and more. Beer by<br>the quart and the bucket! A real good rousing drink! And by God!<br>he was going to have it later on. He thought of the five pound<br>note stowed away in his inner pocket. He still had that to blow,<br>anyway.<br><br>The musical clock that was concealed somewhere in Modigliani's<br>interior struck ten.<br><br>'Shall we shove off?' said Gordon.<br><br>Ravelston's eyes looked pleadingly, guiltily across the table. Let<br>me share the bill! his eyes said. Gordon ignored him.<br><br>'I vote we go to the Cafe Imperial,' he said.<br><br>The bill failed to sober him. A little over two quid for the<br>dinner, thirty bob for the wine. He did not let the others see the<br>bill, of course, but they saw him paying. He threw four pound<br>notes on to the waiter's salver and said casually, 'Keep the<br>change.' That left him with about ten bob besides the fiver.<br>Ravelston was helping Rosemary on with her coat; as she saw Gordon<br>throw notes to the waiter her lips parted in dismay. She had had<br>no idea that the dinner was going to cost anything like four<br>pounds. It horrified her to see him throwing money about like<br>that. Ravelston looked gloomy and disapproving. Gordon damned<br>their eyes again. Why did they have to keep on worrying? He could<br>afford it, couldn't he? He still had that fiver. But by God, it<br>wouldn't be his fault if he got home with a penny left!<br><br>But outwardly he was quite sober, and much more subdued than he<br>had been half an hour ago. 'We'd better have a taxi to the Cafe<br>Imperial,' he said.<br><br>'Oh, let's walk!' said Rosemary. 'It's only a step.'<br><br>'No, we'll have a taxi.'<br><br>They got into the taxi and were driven away, Gordon sitting next to<br>Rosemary. He had half a mind to put his arm round her, in spite of<br>Ravelston's presence. But at that moment a swirl of cold night air<br>came in at the window and blew against Gordon's forehead. It gave<br>him a shock. It was like one of those moments in the night when<br>suddenly from deep sleep you are broad awake and full of some<br>dreadful realization--as that you are doomed to die, for instance,<br>or that your life is a failure. For perhaps a minute he was cold<br>sober. He knew all about himself and the awful folly he was<br>committing--knew that he had squandered five pounds on utter<br>foolishness and was now going to squander the other five that<br>belonged to Julia. He had a fleeting but terribly vivid vision of<br>Julia, with her thin face and her greying hair, in the cold of her<br>dismal bed-sitting room. Poor, good Julia! Julia who had been<br>sacrificed to him all her life, from whom he had borrowed pound<br>after pound after pound; and now he hadn't even the decency to keep<br>her five intact! He recoiled from the thought; he fled back into<br>his drunkenness as into a refuge. Quick, quick, we're getting<br>sober! Booze, more booze! Recapture that first fine careless<br>rapture! Outside, the multi-coloured window of an Italian grocery,<br>still open, swam towards them. He tapped sharply on the glass.<br>The taxi drew up. Gordon began to climb out across Rosemary's<br>knees.<br><br>'Where are you going, Gordon?'<br><br>'To recapture that first fine careless rapture,' said Gordon, on<br>the pavement.<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'It's time we laid in some more booze. The pubs'll be shutting in<br>half an hour.'<br><br>'No, Gordon, no! You're not to get anything more to drink. You've<br>had quite enough already.'<br><br>'Wait!'<br><br>He came out of the shop nursing a litre bottle of Chianti. The<br>grocer had taken the cork out for him and put it in loosely again.<br>The others had grasped now that he was drunk--that he must have<br>been drinking before he met them. It made them both embarrassed.<br>They went into the Cafe Imperial, but the chief thought in both<br>their minds was to get Gordon away and to bed as quickly as<br>possible. Rosemary whispered behind Gordon's back, 'PLEASE don't<br>let him drink any more!' Ravelston nodded gloomily. Gordon was<br>marching ahead of them to a vacant table, not in the least troubled<br>by the stares everyone was casting at the wine-bottle which he<br>carried on his arm. They sat down and ordered coffee, and with<br>some difficulty Ravelston restrained Gordon from ordering brandy as<br>well. All of them were ill at ease. It was horrible in the great<br>garish cafe, stuffily hot and deafeningly noisy with the jabber of<br>several hundred voices, the clatter of plates and glasses, and the<br>intermittent squalling of the band. All three of them wanted to<br>get away. Ravelston was still worrying about the expense, Rosemary<br>was worried because Gordon was drunk, Gordon was restless and<br>thirsty. He had wanted to come here, but he was no sooner here<br>than he wanted to escape. Drunken half was clamouring for a bit<br>of fun. And drunken half wasn't going to be kept in check much<br>longer. Beer, beer! cried drunken half. Gordon hated this stuffy<br>place. He had visions of a pub taproom with great oozy barrels and<br>quart pots topped with foam. He kept an eye on the clock. It was<br>nearly half past ten and the pubs even in Westminster would shut at<br>eleven. Mustn't miss his beer! The bottle of wine was for<br>afterwards, when the pubs were shut. Rosemary was sitting opposite<br>him, talking to Ravelston, uncomfortably but with a sufficient<br>pretence that she was enjoying herself and there was nothing the<br>matter. They were still talking in a rather futile way about<br>Shakespeare. Gordon hated Shakespeare. As he watched Rosemary<br>talking there came over him a violent, perverse desire for her.<br>She was leaning forward, her elbows on the table; he could see her<br>small breasts clearly through her dress. It came to him with a<br>kind of shock, a catch of breath, which once again almost sobered<br>him, that he had seen her naked. She was his girl! He could have<br>her whenever he wanted her! And by God, he was going to have her<br>tonight! Why not? It was a fitting end to the evening. They<br>could find a place easily enough; there are plenty of hotels round<br>Shaftesbury Avenue where they don't ask questions if you can pay<br>the bill. He still had his fiver. He felt her foot under the<br>table, meaning to imprint a delicate caress upon it, and only<br>succeeded in treading on her toe. She drew her foot away from him.<br><br>'Let's get out of this,' he said abruptly, and at once stood up.<br><br>'Oh, let's!' said Rosemary with relief.<br><br>They were in Regent Street again. Down on the left Piccadilly<br>Circus blazed, a horrible pool of light. Rosemary's eyes turned<br>towards the bus stop opposite.<br><br>'It's half past ten,' she said doubtfully. 'I've got to be back by<br>eleven.'<br><br>'Oh, rot! Let's look for a decent pub. I mustn't miss my beer.'<br><br>'Oh, no, Gordon! No more pubs tonight. I couldn't drink any more.<br>Nor ought you.'<br><br>'It doesn't matter. Come this way.'<br><br>He took her by the arm and began to lead her down towards the<br>bottom of Regent Street, holding her rather tight as though afraid<br>she would escape. For the moment he had forgotten about Ravelston.<br>Ravelston followed, wondering whether he ought to leave them to<br>themselves or whether he ought to stay and keep an eye on Gordon.<br>Rosemary hung back, not liking the way Gordon was pulling at her<br>arm.<br><br>'Where are you taking me, Gordon?'<br><br>'Round the corner, where it's dark. I want to kiss you.'<br><br>'I don't think I want to be kissed.'<br><br>'Of course you do.'<br><br>'No!'<br><br>'Yes!'<br><br>She let him take her. Ravelston waited on the corner by the Regent<br>Palace, uncertain what to do. Gordon and Rosemary disappeared<br>round the corner and were almost immediately in darker, narrower<br>streets. The appalling faces of tarts, like skulls coated with<br>pink powder, peered meaningly from several doorways. Rosemary<br>shrank from them. Gordon was rather amused.<br><br>'They think you're one of them,' he explained to her.<br><br>He stood his bottle on the pavement, carefully, against the wall,<br>then suddenly seized her and twisted her backwards. He wanted her<br>badly, and he did not want to waste time over preliminaries. He<br>began to kiss her face all over, clumsily but very hard. She let<br>him do it for a moment, but it frightened her; his face, so close<br>to hers, looked pale, strange, and distracted. He smelt very<br>strongly of wine. She struggled, turning her face away so that he<br>was only kissing her hair and neck.<br><br>'Gordon, you mustn't!'<br><br>'Why mustn't I?'<br><br>'What are you doing?'<br><br>'What do you suppose I'm doing?'<br><br>He shoved her back against the wall, and with the careful,<br>preoccupied movements of a drunken man, tried to undo the front of<br>her dress. It was of a kind that did not undo, as it happened.<br>This time she was angry. She struggled violently, fending his hand<br>aside.<br><br>'Gordon, stop that at once!'<br><br>'Why?'<br><br>'If you do it again I'll smack your face.'<br><br>'Smack my face! Don't you come the Girl Guide with me.'<br><br>'Let me go, will you!'<br><br>'Think of last Sunday,' he said lewdly.<br><br>'Gordon, if you go on I'll hit you, honestly I will.'<br><br>'Not you.'<br><br>He thrust his hand right into the front of her dress. The movement<br>was curiously brutal, as though she had been a stranger to him.<br>She grasped that from the expression of his face. She was not<br>Rosemary to him any longer, she was just a girl, a girl's body.<br>That was the thing that upset her. She struggled and managed to<br>free herself from him. He came after her again and clutched her<br>arm. She smacked his face as hard as she could and dodged neatly<br>out of his reach.<br><br>'What did you do that for?' he said, feeling his cheek but not hurt<br>by the blow.<br><br>'I'm not going to stand that sort of thing. I'm going home.<br>You'll be different tomorrow.'<br><br>'Rot! You come along with me. You're going to bed with me.'<br><br>'Good night!' she said, and fled up the dark side street.<br><br>For a moment he thought of following her, but found his legs too<br>heavy. It did not seem worth while, anyway. He wandered back to<br>where Ravelston was still waiting, looking moody and alone, partly<br>because he was worried about Gordon and partly because he was<br>trying not to notice two hopeful tarts who were on patrol just<br>behind him. Gordon looked properly drunk, Ravelston thought. His<br>hair was tumbling down over his forehead, one side of his face was<br>very pale and on the other there was a red smudge where Rosemary<br>had slapped him. Ravelston thought this must be the flush of<br>drunkenness.<br><br>'What have you done with Rosemary?' he said.<br><br>'She's gone,' said Gordon, with a wave of his hand which was meant<br>to explain everything. 'But the night's still young.'<br><br>'Look here, Gordon, it's time you were in bed.'<br><br>'In bed, yes. But not alone.'<br><br>He stood on the kerb gazing out into the hideous midnight-noon.<br>For a moment he felt quite deathly. His face was burning. His<br>whole body had a dreadful, swollen, fiery feeling. His head in<br>particular seemed on the point of bursting. Somehow the baleful<br>light was bound up with his sensations. He watched the skysigns<br>flicking on and off, glaring red and blue, arrowing up and down--<br>the awful, sinister glitter of a doomed civilization, like the<br>still blazing lights of a sinking ship. He caught Ravelston's arm<br>and made a gesture that comprehended the whole of Piccadilly<br>Circus.<br><br>'The lights down in hell will look just like that.'<br><br>'I shouldn't wonder.'<br><br>Ravelston was looking out for a disengaged taxi. He must get<br>Gordon home to bed without further delay. Gordon wondered whether<br>he was in joy or in agony. That burning, bursting feeling was<br>dreadful. The sober half of him was not dead yet. Sober half<br>still knew with ice-cold clarity what he had done and what he was<br>doing. He had committed follies for which tomorrow he would feel<br>like killing himself. He had squandered five pounds in senseless<br>extravagance, he had robbed Julia, he had insulted Rosemary. And<br>tomorrow--oh, tomorrow, we'll be sober! Go home, go home! cried<br>sober half. ---- to you! said drunken half contemptuously. Drunken<br>half was still clamouring for a bit of fun. And drunken half was<br>the stronger. A fiery clock somewhere opposite caught his eye.<br>Twenty to eleven. Quick, before the pubs are shut! Haro! la gorge<br>m'ard! Once again his thoughts moved lyrically. He felt a hard<br>round shape under his arm, discovered that it was the Chianti<br>bottle, and tweaked out the cork. Ravelston was waving to a taxi-<br>driver without managing to catch his eye. He heard a shocked<br>squeal from the tarts behind. Turning, he saw with horror that<br>Gordon had up-ended the bottle and was drinking from it.<br><br>'Hi! Gordon!'<br><br>He sprang towards him and forced his arm down. A gout of wine went<br>down Gordon's collar.<br><br>'For God's sake be careful! You don't want the police to get hold<br>of you, do you?'<br><br>'I want a drink,' complained Gordon.<br><br>'But dash it! You can't start drinking here.'<br><br>'Take me to a pub,' said Gordon.<br><br>Ravelston rubbed his nose helplessly. 'Oh, God! I suppose that's<br>better than drinking on the pavement. Come on, we'll go to a pub.<br>You shall have your drink there.'<br><br>Gordon recorked his bottle carefully. Ravelston shepherded him<br>across the circus, Gordon clinging to his arm, but not for support,<br>for his legs were still quite steady. They halted on the island,<br>then managed to find a gap in the traffic and went down the<br>Haymarket.<br><br>In the pub the air seemed wet with beer. It was all a mist of beer<br>shot through with the sickly tang of whisky. Along the bar a press<br>of men seethed, downing with Faustlike eagerness their last drinks<br>before eleven should sound its knell. Gordon slid easily through<br>the crowd. He was not in a mood to worry about a few jostlings and<br>elbowings. In a moment he had fetched up at the bar between a<br>stout commercial traveller drinking Guinness and a tall, lean,<br>decayed major type of man with droopy moustaches, whose entire<br>conversation seemed to consist of 'What ho!' and 'What, what!'<br>Gordon threw half a crown on to the beer-wet bar.<br><br>'A quart of bitter, please!'<br><br>'No quart pots here!' cried the harassed barmaid, measuring pegs of<br>whisky with one eye on the clock.<br><br>'Quart pots on the top shelf, Effie!' shouted the landlord over his<br>shoulder, from the other side of the bar.<br><br>The barmaid hauled the beer-handle three times hurriedly. The<br>monstrous glass pot was set before him. He lifted it. What a<br>weight! A pint of pure water weighs a pound and a quarter.<br>Down with it! Swish--gurgle! A long, long sup of beer flowed<br>gratefully down his gullet. He paused for breath, and felt a<br>little sickish. Come on, now for another. Swish--gurgle! It<br>almost choked him this time. But stick it out, stick it out!<br>Through the cascade of beer that poured down his throat and seemed<br>to drown his ears he heard the landlord's shout: 'Last orders,<br>gentlemen, please!' For a moment he removed his face from the pot,<br>gasped, and got his breath back. Now for the last. Swish--gurgle!<br>A-a-ah! Gordon set down the pot. Emptied in three gulps--not bad.<br>He clattered it on the bar.<br><br>'Hi! Give me the other half of that--quick!'<br><br>'What ho!' said the major.<br><br>'Coming it a bit, aren't you?' said the commercial traveller.<br><br>Ravelston, farther down the bar and hemmed in by several men, saw<br>what Gordon was doing. He called to him, 'Hi, Gordon!', frowned<br>and shook his head, too shy to say in front of everybody, 'Don't<br>drink any more.' Gordon settled himself on his legs. He was still<br>steady, but consciously steady. His head seemed to have swollen to<br>an immense size, his whole body had the same horrible, swollen,<br>fiery feeling as before. Languidly he lifted the refilled beerpot.<br>He did not want it now. Its smell nauseated him. It was just a<br>hateful, pale yellow, sickly-tasting liquid. Like urine, almost!<br>That bucketful of stuff to be forced down into his bursting guts--<br>horrible! But come on, no flinching! What else are we here for?<br>Down with it! Here she is so near my nose. So tip her up and down<br>she goes. Swish--gurgle!<br><br>In the same moment something dreadful happened. His gullet had<br>shut up of its own accord, or the beer had missed his mouth. It<br>was pouring all over him, a tidal wave of beer. He was drowning in<br>beer like lay-brother Peter in the Ingoldsby Legends. Help! He<br>tried to shout, choked, and let fall the beer-pot. There was a<br>flurry all round him. People were leaping aside to avoid the jet<br>of beer. Crash! went the pot. Gordon stood rocking. Men,<br>bottles, mirrors were going round and round. He was falling,<br>losing consciousness. But dimly visible before him was a black<br>upright shape, sole point of stability in a reeling world--the<br>beer-handle. He clutched it, swung, held tight. Ravelston started<br>towards him.<br><br>The barmaid leaned indignantly over the bar. The roundabout world<br>slowed down and stopped. Gordon's brain was quite clear.<br><br>'Here! What are you hanging on to the beer-handle for?'<br><br>'All over my bloody trousers!' cried the commercial traveller.<br><br>'What am I hanging on to the beer-handle for?'<br><br>'YES! What are you hanging on to the beer-handle for?'<br><br>Gordon swung himself sideways. The elongated face of the major<br>peered down at him, with wet moustaches drooping.<br><br>'She says, "What am I hanging on to the beer-handle for?"'<br><br>'What ho! What?'<br><br>Ravelston had forced his way between several men and reached him.<br>He put a strong arm round Gordon's waist and hoisted him to his<br>feet.<br><br>'Stand up, for God's sake! You're drunk.'<br><br>'Drunk?' said Gordon.<br><br>Everyone was laughing at them. Ravelston's pale face flushed.<br><br>'Two and three those mugs cost,' said the barmaid bitterly.<br><br>'And what about my bloody trousers?' said the commercial traveller.<br><br>'I'll pay for the mug,' said Ravelston. He did so. 'Now come on<br>out of it. You're drunk.'<br><br>He began to shepherd Gordon towards the door, one arm round his<br>shoulder, the other holding the Chianti bottle, which he had taken<br>from him earlier. Gordon freed himself. He could walk with<br>perfect steadiness. He said in a dignified manner:<br><br>'Drunk did you say I was?'<br><br>Ravelston took his arm again. 'Yes, I'm afraid you are. Decidedly.'<br><br>'Swan swam across the sea, well swam swan,' said Gordon.<br><br>'Gordon, you ARE drunk. The sooner you're in bed the better.'<br><br>'First cast out the beam that is in thine own eye before thou<br>castest out the mote that is in thy brother's,' said Gordon.<br><br>Ravelston had got him out on to the pavement by this time. 'We'd<br>better get hold of a taxi,' he said, looking up and down the<br>street.<br><br>There seemed to be no taxis about, however. The people were<br>streaming noisily out of the pub, which was on the point of<br>closing. Gordon felt better in the open air. His brain had never<br>been clearer. The red satanic gleam of a Neon light, somewhere in<br>the distance, put a new and brilliant idea into his head. He<br>plucked at Ravelston's arm.<br><br>'Ravelston! I say, Ravelston!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Let's pick up a couple of tarts.'<br><br>In spite of Gordon's drunken state, Ravelston was scandalized. 'My<br>dear old chap! You can't do that kind of thing.'<br><br>'Don't be so damned upper-class. Why not?'<br><br>'But how could you, dash it! After you've just said good night to<br>Rosemary--a really charming girl like that!'<br><br>'At night all cats are grey,' said Gordon, with the feeling that he<br>voiced a profound and cynical wisdom.<br><br>Ravelston decided to ignore this remark. 'We'd better walk up to<br>Piccadilly Circus,' he said. 'There'll be plenty of taxis there.'<br><br>The theatres were emptying. Crowds of people and streams of cars<br>flowed to and fro in the frightful corpse-light. Gordon's brain<br>was marvellously clear. He knew what folly and evil he had<br>committed and was about to commit. And yet after all it hardly<br>seemed to matter. He saw as something far, far away, like<br>something seen through the wrong end of the telescope, his thirty<br>years, his wasted life, the blank future, Julia's five pounds,<br>Rosemary. He said with a sort of philosophic interest:<br><br>'Look at the Neon lights! Look at those awful blue ones over the<br>rubber shop. When I see those lights I know that I'm a damned<br>soul.'<br><br>'Quite,' said Ravelston, who was not listening. 'Ah, there's a<br>taxi!' He signalled. 'Damn! He didn't see me. Wait here a<br>second.'<br><br>He left Gordon by the Tube station and hurried across the street.<br>For a little while Gordon's mind receded into blankness. Then he<br>was aware of two hard yet youthful faces, like the faces of young<br>predatory animals, that had come close up to his own. They had<br>blackened eye-brows and hats that were like vulgarer versions of<br>Rosemary's. He was exchanging badinage with them. This seemed to<br>him to have been going on for several minutes.<br><br>'Hullo, Dora! Hullo, Barbara! (He knew their names, it seemed.)<br>And how are you? And how's old England's winding-sheet?'<br><br>'Oo--haven't you got a cheek, just!'<br><br>'And what are you up to at this time of night?'<br><br>'Oo--jes' strolling around.'<br><br>'Like a lion, seeking whom he may devour?'<br><br>'Oo--you haven't half got a cheek! Hasn't he got a cheek, Barbara?<br>You HAVE got a cheek!'<br><br>Ravelston had caught the taxi and brought it round to where Gordon<br>was standing. He stepped out, saw Gordon between the two girls,<br>and stood aghast.<br><br>'Gordon! Oh, my God! What the devil have you been doing?'<br><br>'Let me introduce you. Dora and Barbara,' said Gordon.<br><br>For a moment Ravelston looked almost angry. As a matter of fact,<br>Ravelston was incapable of being properly angry. Upset, pained,<br>embarrassed--yes; but not angry. He stepped forward with a<br>miserable effort not to notice the two girls' existence. Once he<br>noticed them the game was up. He took Gordon by the arm and would<br>have bundled him into the taxi.<br><br>'Come on, Gordon, for God's sake! Here's the taxi. We'll go<br>straight home and put you to bed.'<br><br>Dora caught Gordon's other arm and hauled him out of reach as<br>though he had been a stolen handbag.<br><br>'What bloody business is it of yours?' she cried ferociously.<br><br>'You don't want to insult these two ladies, I hope?' said Gordon.<br><br>Ravelston faltered, stepped back, rubbed his nose. It was a moment<br>to be firm; but Ravelston had never in his life been firm. He<br>looked from Dora to Gordon, from Gordon to Barbara. That was<br>fatal. Once he had looked them in the face he was lost. Oh, God!<br>What could he do? They were human beings--he couldn't insult them.<br>The same instinct that sent his hand into his pocket at the very<br>sight of a beggar made him helpless at this moment. The poor,<br>wretched girls! He hadn't the heart to send them packing into the<br>night. Suddenly he realized that he would have to go through with<br>this abominable adventure into which Gordon had led him. For the<br>first time in his life he was let in for going home with a tart.<br><br>'But dash it all!' he said feebly.<br><br>'Allons-y,' said Gordon.<br><br>The taximan had taken his direction at a nod from Dora. Gordon<br>slumped into the corner seat and seemed immediately to sink into<br>some immense abyss from which he rose again more gradually and with<br>only partial consciousness of what he had been doing. He was<br>gliding smoothly through darkness starred with lights. Or were the<br>lights moving and he stationary? It was like being on the ocean<br>bottom, among the luminous, gliding fishes. The fancy returned to<br>him that he was a damned soul in hell. The landscape in hell would<br>be just like this. Ravines of cold evil-coloured fire, with<br>darkness all above. But in hell there would be torment. Was this<br>torment? He strove to classify his sensations. The momentary lapse<br>into unconsciousness had left him weak, sick, shaken; his forehead<br>seemed to be splitting. He put out a hand. It encountered a knee,<br>a garter, and a small soft hand which sought mechanically for his.<br>He became aware that Ravelston, sitting opposite, was tapping his<br>toe urgently and nervously.<br><br>'Gordon! Gordon! Wake up!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Gordon! Oh, damn! Causons en francais. Qu'est-ce que tu as<br>fait? Crois-tu que je veux coucher avec une sale--oh, damnation!'<br><br>'Oo-parley-voo francey!' squealed the girls.<br><br>Gordon was mildly amused. Do Ravelston good, he thought. A<br>parlour Socialist going home with a tart! The first genuinely<br>proletarian action of his life. As though aware of this thought,<br>Ravelston subsided into his corner in silent misery, sitting as far<br>away from Barbara as possible. The taxi drew up at a hotel in a<br>side-street; a dreadful, shoddy, low place it was. The 'hotel'<br>sign over the door looked skew-eyed. The windows were almost dark,<br>but the sound of singing, boozy and dreary, trickled from within.<br>Gordon staggered out of the taxi and felt for Dora's arm. Give us<br>a hand, Dora. Mind the step. What ho!<br><br>A smallish, darkish, smelly hallway, lino-carpeted, mean, uncared-<br>for, and somehow impermanent. From a room somewhere on the left<br>the singing swelled, mournful as a church organ. A cross-eyed,<br>evil-looking chambermaid appeared from nowhere. She and Dora<br>seemed to know one another. What a mug! No competition there.<br>From the room on the left a single voice took up the song with<br>would-be facetious emphasis:<br><br><br>'The man that kisses a pretty girl<br>And goes and tells his mother,<br>Ought to have his lips cut off,<br>Ought to--'<br><br><br>It tailed away, full of the ineffable, undisguisable sadness of<br>debauchery. A very young voice it sounded. The voice of some poor<br>boy who in his heart only wanted to be at home with his mother and<br>sisters, playing hunt-the-slipper. There was a party of young<br>fools in there, on the razzle with whisky and girls. The tune<br>reminded Gordon. He turned to Ravelston as he came in, Barbara<br>following.<br><br>'Where's my Chianti?' he said.<br><br>Ravelston gave him the bottle. His face looked pale, harassed,<br>hunted, almost. With guilty restless movements he kept himself<br>apart from Barbara. He could not touch her or even look at her,<br>and yet to escape was beyond him. His eyes sought Gordon's. 'For<br>the love of God can't we get out of it somehow?' they signalled.<br>Gordon frowned at him. Stick it out! No flinching! He took<br>Dora's arm again. Come on, Dora! Now for those stairs. Ah!<br>Wait a moment.<br><br>Her arm round his waist, supporting him, Dora drew him aside. Down<br>the darkish, smelly stairs a young woman came mincingly, buttoning<br>on a glove; after her a bald, middle-aged man in evening clothes,<br>black overcoat, and white silk muffler, his opera hat in his hand.<br>He walked past them with small mean mouth tightened, pretending not<br>to see them. A family man, by the guilty look in his eye. Gordon<br>watched the gaslight gleam on the back of his bald head. His<br>predecessor. In the same bed, probably. The mantle of Elisha.<br>Now then, Dora, up we go! Ah, these stairs! Difficilis ascensus<br>Averni. That's right, here we are! 'Mind the step,' said Dora.<br>They were on the landing. Black and white lino like a chessboard.<br>White-painted doors. A smell of slops and a fainter smell of stale<br>linen.<br><br>We this way, you that. At the other door Ravelston halted, his<br>fingers on the handle. He could not--no, he COULD not do it. He<br>could not enter that dreadful room. For the last time his eyes,<br>like those of a dog about to be whipped, turned upon Gordon. 'Must<br>I, must I?' his eyes said. Gordon eyed him sternly. Stick it out,<br>Regulus! March to your doom! Atqui sciebat quae sibi Barbara. It<br>is a far, far more proletarian thing that you do. And then with<br>startling suddenness Ravelston's face cleared. An expression of<br>relief, almost of joy, stole over it. A wonderful thought had<br>occurred to him. After all, you could always pay the girl without<br>actually doing anything! Thank God! He set his shoulders, plucked<br>up courage, went in. The door shut.<br><br>So here we are. A mean, dreadful room. Lino on the floor, gas-<br>fire, huge double bed with sheets vaguely dingy. Over the bed a<br>framed coloured picture from La Vie Parisienne. A mistake, that.<br>Sometimes the originals don't compare so well. And, by Jove! on<br>the bamboo table by the window, positively an aspidistra! Hast<br>thou found me, O mine enemy? But come here, Dora. Let's have a<br>look at you.<br><br>He seemed to be lying on the bed. He could not see very well. Her<br>youthful, rapacious face, with blackened eyebrows, leaned over him<br>as he sprawled there.<br><br>'How about my present?' she demanded, half wheedling, half<br>menacing.<br><br>Never mind that now. To work! Come here. Not a bad mouth. Come<br>here. Come closer. Ah!<br><br>No. No use. Impossible. The will but not the way. The spirit is<br>willing but the flesh is weak. Try again. No. The booze, it must<br>be. See Macbeth. One last try. No, no use. Not this evening,<br>I'm afraid.<br><br>All right, Dora, don't you worry. You'll get your two quid all<br>right. We aren't paying by results.<br><br>He made a clumsy gesture. 'Here, give us that bottle. That bottle<br>off the dressing-table.'<br><br>Dora brought it. Ah, that's better. That at least doesn't fail.<br>With hands that had swollen to monstrous size he up-ended the<br>Chianti bottle. The wine flowed down his throat, bitter and<br>choking, and some of it went up his nose. It overwhelmed him. He<br>was slipping, sliding, falling off the bed. His head met the<br>floor. His legs were still on the bed. For a while he lay in this<br>position. Is this the way to live? Down below the youthful voices<br>were still mournfully singing:<br><br><br>'For tonight we'll merry be,<br>For tonight we'll merry be,<br>For tonight we'll merry be-e-e--<br>Tomorrow we'll be so-ober!' <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/7.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/9.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
