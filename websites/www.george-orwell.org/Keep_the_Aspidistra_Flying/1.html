<h2>Chapter 1</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The clock struck half past two. In the little office at the back<br>of Mr McKechnie's bookshop, Gordon--Gordon Comstock, last member<br>of the Comstock family, aged twenty-nine and rather moth-eaten<br>already--lounged across the table, pushing a four-penny packet of<br>Player's Weights open and shut with his thumb.<br><br>The ding-dong of another, remoter clock--from the Prince of Wales,<br>the other side of the street--rippled the stagnant air. Gordon<br>made an effort, sat upright, and stowed his packet of cigarettes<br>away in his inside pocket. He was perishing for a smoke. However,<br>there were only four cigarettes left. Today was Wednesday and he<br>had no money coming to him till Friday. It would be too bloody to<br>be without tobacco tonight as well as all tomorrow.<br><br>Bored in advance by tomorrow's tobaccoless hours, he got up and<br>moved towards the door--a small frail figure, with delicate bones<br>and fretful movements. His coat was out at elbow in the right<br>sleeve and its middle button was missing; his ready-made flannel<br>trousers were stained and shapeless. Even from above you could see<br>that his shoes needed resoling.<br><br>The money clinked in his trouser pocket as he got up. He knew<br>the precise sum that was there. Fivepence halfpenny--twopence<br>halfpenny and a Joey. He paused, took out the miserable little<br>threepenny-bit, and looked at it. Beastly, useless thing! And<br>bloody fool to have taken it! It had happened yesterday, when he<br>was buying cigarettes. 'Don't mind a threepenny-bit, do you, sir?'<br>the little bitch of a shop-girl had chirped. And of course he had<br>let her give it him. 'Oh no, not at all!' he had said--fool,<br>bloody fool!<br><br>His heart sickened to think that he had only fivepence halfpenny in<br>the world, threepence of which couldn't even be spent. Because how<br>can you buy anything with a threepenny-bit? It isn't a coin, it's<br>the answer to a riddle. You look such a fool when you take it out<br>of your pocket, unless it's in among a whole handful of other<br>coins. 'How much?' you say. 'Threepence,' the shop-girl says.<br>And then you feel all round your pocket and fish out that absurd<br>little thing, all by itself, sticking on the end of your finger<br>like a tiddley-wink. The shop-girl sniffs. She spots immediately<br>that it's your last threepence in the world. You see her glance<br>quickly at it--she's wondering whether there's a piece of Christmas<br>pudding still sticking to it. And you stalk out with your nose in<br>the air, and can't ever go to that shop again. No! We won't spend<br>our Joey. Twopence halfpenny left--twopence halfpenny to last till<br>Friday.<br><br>This was the lonely after-dinner hour, when few or no customers<br>were to be expected. He was alone with seven thousand books. The<br>small dark room, smelling of dust and decayed paper, that gave on<br>the office, was filled to the brim with books, mostly aged and<br>unsaleable. On the top shelves near the ceiling the quarto volumes<br>of extinct encyclopedias slumbered on their sides in piles like the<br>tiered coffins in common graves. Gordon pushed aside the blue,<br>dust-sodden curtains that served as a doorway to the next room.<br>This, better lighted than the other, contained the lending library.<br>It was one of those 'twopenny no-deposit' libraries beloved of<br>book-pinchers. No books in it except novels, of course. And WHAT<br>novels! But that too was a matter of course.<br><br>Eight hundred strong, the novels lined the room on three sides<br>ceiling-high, row upon row of gaudy oblong backs, as though the<br>walls had been built of many-coloured bricks laid upright. They<br>were arranged alphabetically. Arlen, Burroughs, Deeping, Dell,<br>Frankau, Galsworthy, Gibbs, Priestley, Sapper, Walpole. Gordon<br>eyed them with inert hatred. At this moment he hated all books,<br>and novels most of all. Horrible to think of all that soggy, half-<br>baked trash massed together in one place. Pudding, suet pudding.<br>Eight hundred slabs of pudding, walling him in--a vault of<br>puddingstone. The thought was oppressive. He moved on through the<br>open doorway into the front part of the shop. In doing so, he<br>smoothed his hair. It was an habitual movement. After all, there<br>might be girls outside the glass door. Gordon was not impressive<br>to look at. He was just five feet seven inches high, and because<br>his hair was usually too long he gave the impression that his head<br>was a little too big for his body. He was never quite unconscious<br>of his small stature. When he knew that anyone was looking at him<br>he carried himself very upright, throwing a chest, with a you-be-<br>damned air which occasionally deceived simple people.<br><br>However, there was nobody outside. The front room, unlike the rest<br>of the shop, was smart and expensive-looking, and it contained<br>about two thousand books, exclusive of those in the window. On the<br>right there was a glass showcase in which children's books were<br>kept. Gordon averted his eyes from a beastly Rackhamesque dust-<br>jacket; elvish children tripping Wendily through a bluebell glade.<br>He gazed out through the glass door. A foul day, and the wind<br>rising. The sky was leaden, the cobbles of the street were slimy.<br>It was St Andrew's day, the thirtieth of November. McKechnie's<br>stood on a corner, on a sort of shapeless square where four streets<br>converged. To the left, just within sight from the door, stood a<br>great elm-tree, leafless now, its multitudinous twigs making sepia-<br>coloured lace against the sky. Opposite, next to the Prince of<br>Wales, were tall hoardings covered with ads for patent foods and<br>patent medicines. A gallery of monstrous doll-faces--pink vacuous<br>faces, full of goofy optimism. Q.T. Sauce, Truweet Breakfast<br>Crisps ('Kiddies clamour for their Breakfast Crisps'), Kangaroo<br>Burgundy, Vitamalt Chocolate, Bovex. Of them all, the Bovex one<br>oppressed Gordon the most. A spectacled rat-faced clerk, with<br>patent-leather hair, sitting at a cafe table grinning over a white<br>mug of Bovex. 'Corner Table enjoys his meal with Bovex', the<br>legend ran.<br><br>Gordon shortened the focus of his eyes. From the dust-dulled pane<br>the reflection of his own face looked back at him. Not a good<br>face. Not thirty yet, but moth-eaten already. Very pale, with<br>bitter, ineradicable lines. What people call a 'good' forehead--<br>high, that is--but a small pointed chin, so that the face as a<br>whole was pear-shaped rather than oval. Hair mouse-coloured and<br>unkempt, mouth unamiable, eyes hazel inclining to green. He<br>lengthened the focus of his eyes again. He hated mirrors nowadays.<br>Outside, all was bleak and wintry. A tram, like a raucous swan of<br>steel, glided groaning over the cobbles, and in its wake the wind<br>swept a debris of trampled leaves. The twigs of the elm-tree were<br>swirling, straining eastward. The poster that advertised Q.T.<br>Sauce was torn at the edge; a ribbon of paper fluttered fitfully<br>like a tiny pennant. In the side street too, to the right, the<br>naked poplars that lined the pavement bowed sharply as the wind<br>caught them. A nasty raw wind. There was a threatening note in it<br>as it swept over; the first growl of winter's anger. Two lines of<br>a poem struggled for birth in Gordon's mind:<br><br>Sharply the something wind--for instance, threatening wind? No,<br>better, menacing wind. The menacing wind blows over--no, sweeps<br>over, say.<br><br>The something poplars--yielding poplars? No, better, bending<br>poplars. Assonance between bending and menacing? No matter. The<br>bending poplars, newly bare. Good.<br><br><br>Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over<br>The bending poplars, newly bare.<br><br><br>Good. 'Bare' is a sod to rhyme; however, there's always 'air',<br>which every poet since Chaucer has been struggling to find rhymes<br>for. But the impulse died away in Gordon's mind. He turned the<br>money over in his pocket. Twopence halfpenny and a Joey--twopence<br>halfpenny. His mind was sticky with boredom. He couldn't cope<br>with rhymes and adjectives. You can't, with only twopence<br>halfpenny in your pocket.<br><br>His eyes refocused themselves upon the posters opposite. He had<br>his private reasons for hating them. Mechanically he re-read their<br>slogans. 'Kangaroo Burgundy--the wine for Britons.' 'Asthma was<br>choking her!' 'Q.T. Sauce Keeps Hubby Smiling.' 'Hike all day on<br>a Slab of Vitamalt!' 'Curve Cut--the Smoke for Outdoor Men.'<br>'Kiddies clamour for their Breakfast Crisps.' 'Corner Table enjoys<br>his meal with Bovex.'<br><br>Ha! A customer--potential, at any rate. Gordon stiffened himself.<br>Standing by the door, you could get an oblique view out of the<br>front window without being seen yourself. He looked the potential<br>customer over.<br><br>A decentish middle-aged man, black suit, bowler hat, umbrella, and<br>dispatch-case--provincial solicitor or Town Clerk--keeking at the<br>window with large pale-coloured eyes. He wore a guilty look.<br>Gordon followed the direction of his eyes. Ah! So that was it!<br>He had nosed out those D. H. Lawrence first editions in the far<br>corner. Pining for a bit of smut, of course. He had heard of Lady<br>Chatterley afar off. A bad face he had, Gordon thought. Pale,<br>heavy, downy, with bad contours. Welsh, by the look of him--<br>Nonconformist, anyway. He had the regular Dissenting pouches round<br>the corners of his mouth. At home, president of the local Purity<br>League or Seaside Vigilance Committee (rubber-soled slippers and<br>electric torch, spotting kissing couples along the beach parade),<br>and now up in town on the razzle. Gordon wished he would come in.<br>Sell him a copy of Women in Love. How it would disappoint him!<br><br>But no! The Welsh solicitor had funked it. He tucked his umbrella<br>under his arm and moved off with righteously turned backside. But<br>doubtless tonight, when darkness hid his blushes, he'd slink into<br>one of the rubber-shops and buy High Jinks in a Parisian Convent,<br>by Sadie Blackeyes.<br><br>Gordon turned away from the door and back to the book-shelves. In<br>the shelves to your left as you came out of the library the new and<br>nearly-new books were kept--a patch of bright colour that was meant<br>to catch the eye of anyone glancing through the glass door. Their<br>sleek unspotted backs seemed to yearn at you from the shelves.<br>'Buy me, buy me!' they seemed to be saying. Novels fresh from the<br>press--still unravished brides, pining for the paperknife to<br>deflower them--and review copies, like youthful widows, blooming<br>still though virgin no longer, and here and there, in sets of half<br>a dozen, those pathetic spinster-things, 'remainders', still<br>guarding hopefully their long preserv'd virginity. Gordon turned<br>his eyes away from the 'remainders'. They called up evil memories.<br>The single wretched little book that he himself had published, two<br>years ago, had sold exactly a hundred and fifty-three copies and<br>then been 'remaindered'; and even as a 'remainder' it hadn't sold.<br>He passed the new books by and paused in front of the shelves which<br>ran at right angles to them and which contained more second-hand<br>books.<br><br>Over to the right were shelves of poetry. Those in front of him<br>were prose, a miscellaneous lot. Upwards and downwards they were<br>graded, from clean and expensive at eye-level to cheap and dingy at<br>top and bottom. In all book-shops there goes on a savage Darwinian<br>struggle in which the works of living men gravitate to eye-level<br>and the works of dead men go up or down--down to Gehenna or up to<br>the throne, but always away from any position where they will be<br>noticed. Down in the bottom shelves the 'classics', the extinct<br>monsters of the Victorian age, were quietly rotting. Scott,<br>Carlyle, Meredith, Ruskin, Pater, Stevenson--you could hardly read<br>the names upon their broad dowdy backs. In the top shelves, almost<br>out of sight, slept the pudgy biographies of dukes. Below those,<br>saleable still and therefore placed within reach, was 'religious'<br>literature--all sects and all creeds, lumped indiscriminately<br>together. The World Beyond, by the author of Spirit Hands Have<br>Touched me. Dean Farrar's Life of Christ. Jesus the First<br>Rotarian. Father Hilaire Chestnut's latest book of R. C.<br>propaganda. Religion always sells provided it is soppy enough.<br>Below, exactly at eye-level, was the contemporary stuff.<br>Priestley's latest. Dinky little books of reprinted 'middles'.<br>Cheer-up 'humour' from Herbert and Knox and Milne. Some highbrow<br>stuff as well. A novel or two by Hemingway and Virginia Woolf.<br>Smart pseudo-Strachey predigested biographies. Snooty, refined<br>books on safe painters and safe poets by those moneyed young beasts<br>who glide so gracefully from Eton to Cambridge and from Cambridge<br>to the literary reviews.<br><br>Dull-eyed, he gazed at the wall of books. He hated the whole lot<br>of them, old and new, highbrow and lowbrow, snooty and chirpy. The<br>mere sight of them brought home to him his own sterility. For here<br>was he, supposedly a 'writer', and he couldn't even 'write'! It<br>wasn't merely a question of not getting published; it was that he<br>produced nothing, or next to nothing. And all that tripe<br>cluttering the shelves--well, at any rate it existed; it was an<br>achievement of sorts. Even the Dells and Deepings do at least turn<br>out their yearly acre of print. But it was the snooty 'cultured'<br>kind of books that he hated the worst. Books of criticism and<br>belles-lettres. The kind of thing that those moneyed young beasts<br>from Cambridge write almost in their sleep--and that Gordon himself<br>might have written if he had had a little more money. Money and<br>culture! In a country like England you can no more be cultured<br>without money than you can join the Cavalry Club. With the same<br>instinct that makes a child waggle a loose tooth, he took out a<br>snooty-looking volume--Some Aspects of the Italian Baroque--opened<br>it, read a paragraph, and shoved it back with mingled loathing and<br>envy. That devastating omniscience! That noxious, horn-spectacled<br>refinement! And the money that such refinement means! For after<br>all, what is there behind it, except money? Money for the right<br>kind of education, money for influential friends, money for leisure<br>and peace of mind, money for trips to Italy. Money writes books,<br>money sells them. Give me not righteousness, O Lord, give me<br>money, only money.<br><br>He jingled the coins in his pocket. He was nearly thirty and had<br>accomplished nothing; only his miserable book of poems that had<br>fallen flatter than any pancake. And ever since, for two whole<br>years, he had been struggling in the labyrinth of a dreadful book<br>that never got any further, and which, as he knew in his moments of<br>clarity, never would get any further. It was the lack of money,<br>simply the lack of money, that robbed him of the power to 'write'.<br>He clung to that as to an article of faith. Money, money, all is<br>money! Could you write even a penny novelette without money to put<br>heart in you? Invention, energy, wit, style, charm--they've all<br>got to be paid for in hard cash.<br><br>Nevertheless, as he looked along the shelves he felt himself a<br>little comforted. So many of the books were faded and unreadable.<br>After all, we're all in the same boat. Memento mori. For you and<br>for me and for the snooty young men from Cambridge, the same<br>oblivion waits--though doubtless it'll wait rather longer for those<br>snooty young men from Cambridge. He looked at the time-dulled<br>'classics' near his feet. Dead, all dead. Carlyle and Ruskin and<br>Meredith and Stevenson--all are dead, God rot them. He glanced<br>over their faded titles. Collected Letters of Robert Louis<br>Stevenson. Ha, ha! That's good. Collected Letters of Robert<br>Louis Stevenson! Its top edge was black with dust. Dust thou art,<br>to dust returnest. Gordon kicked Stevenson's buckram backside.<br>Art there, old false-penny? You're cold meat, if ever Scotchman<br>was.<br><br>Ping! The shop bell. Gordon turned round. Two customers, for the<br>library.<br><br>A dejected, round-shouldered, lower-class woman, looking like a<br>draggled duck nosing among garbage, seeped in, fumbling with a rush<br>basket. In her wake hopped a plump little sparrow of a woman, red-<br>cheeked, middle-middle class, carrying under her arm a copy of The<br>Forsyte Saga--title outwards, so that passers-by could spot her for<br>a high-brow.<br><br>Gordon had taken off his sour expression. He greeted them with the<br>homey, family-doctor geniality reserved for library-subscribers.<br><br>'Good afternoon, Mrs Weaver. Good afternoon, Mrs Penn. What<br>terrible weather!'<br><br>'Shocking!' said Mrs Penn.<br><br>He stood aside to let them pass. Mrs Weaver upset her rush basket<br>and spilled on to the floor a much-thumbed copy of Ethel M. Dell's<br>Silver Wedding. Mrs Penn's bright bird-eye lighted upon it.<br>Behind Mrs Weaver's back she smiled up to Gordon, archly, as<br>highbrow to highbrow. Dell! The lowness of it! The books these<br>lower classes read! Understandingly, he smiled back. They passed<br>into the library, highbrow to highbrow smiling.<br><br>Mrs Penn laid The Forsyte Saga on the table and turned her sparrow-<br>bosom upon Gordon. She was always very affable to Gordon. She<br>addressed him as Mister Comstock, shopwalker though he was, and<br>held literary conversations with him. There was the free-masonry<br>of highbrows between them.<br><br>'I hope you enjoyed The Forsyte Saga, Mrs Penn?'<br><br>'What a perfectly MARVELLOUS achievement that book is, Mr Comstock!<br>Do you know that that makes the fourth time I've read it? An epic,<br>a real epic!'<br><br>Mrs Weaver nosed among the books, too dim-witted to grasp that they<br>were in alphabetical order.<br><br>'I don't know what to 'ave this week, that I don't,' she mumbled<br>through untidy lips. 'My daughter she keeps on at me to 'ave a try<br>at Deeping. She's great on Deeping, my daughter is. But my son-<br>in-law, now, 'e's more for Burroughs. I don't know, I'm sure.'<br><br>A spasm passed over Mrs Penn's face at the mention of Burroughs.<br>She turned her back markedly on Mrs Weaver.<br><br>'What I feel, Mr Comstock, is that there's something so BIG about<br>Galsworthy. He's so broad, so universal, and yet at the same time<br>so thoroughly English in spirit, so HUMAN. His books are real<br>HUMAN documents.'<br><br>'And Priestley, too,' said Gordon. 'I think Priestley's such an<br>awfully fine writer, don't you?'<br><br>'Oh, he is! So big, so broad, so human! And so essentially<br>English!'<br><br>Mrs Weaver pursed her lips. Behind them were three isolated yellow<br>teeth.<br><br>'I think p'raps I can do better'n 'ave another Dell,' she said.<br>'You 'ave got some more Dells, 'aven't you? I DO enjoy a good read<br>of Dell, I must say. I says to my daughter, I says, "You can keep<br>your Deepings and your Burroughses. Give me Dell," I says.'<br><br>Ding Dong Dell! Dukes and dogwhips! Mrs Penn's eye signalled<br>highbrow irony. Gordon returned her signal. Keep in with Mrs<br>Penn! A good, steady customer.<br><br>'Oh, certainly, Mrs Weaver. We've got a whole shelf by Ethel M.<br>Dell. Would you like The Desire of his Life? Or perhaps you've<br>read that. Then what about The Alter of Honour?'<br><br>'I wonder whether you have Hugh Walpole's latest book?' said Mrs<br>Penn. 'I feel in the mood this week for something epic, something<br>BIG. Now Walpole, you know, I consider a really GREAT writer, I<br>put him second only to Galsworthy. There's something so BIG about<br>him. And yet he's so human with it.'<br><br>'And so essentially English,' said Gordon.<br><br>'Oh, of course! So essentially English!'<br><br>'I b'lieve I'll jest 'ave The Way of an Eagle over again,' said Mrs<br>Weaver finally. 'You don't never seem to get tired of The Way of<br>an Eagle, do you, now?'<br><br>'It's certainly astonishingly popular,' said Gordon, diplomatically,<br>his eye on Mrs Penn.<br><br>'Oh, asTONishingly!' echoed Mrs Penn, ironically, her eye on<br>Gordon.<br><br>He took their twopences and sent them happy away, Mrs Penn with<br>Walpole's Rogue Herries and Mrs Weaver with The Way of an Eagle.<br><br>Soon he had wandered back to the other room and towards the shelves<br>of poetry. A melancholy fascination, those shelves had for him.<br>His own wretched book was there--skied, of course, high up among<br>the unsaleable. Mice, by Gordon Comstock; a sneaky little foolscap<br>octavo, price three and sixpence but now reduced to a bob. Of the<br>thirteen B.F.s who had reviewed it (and The Times Lit. Supp. had<br>declared that it showed 'exceptional promise') not one had seen the<br>none too subtle joke of that title. And in the two years he had<br>been at McKechnie's bookshop, not a single customer, not a single<br>one, had ever taken Mice out of its shelf.<br><br>There were fifteen or twenty shelves of poetry. Gordon regarded<br>them sourly. Dud stuff, for the most part. A little above eye-<br>level, already on their way to heaven and oblivion, were the poets<br>of yesteryear, the stars of his earlier youth. Yeats, Davies,<br>Housman, Thomas, De la Mare, Hardy. Dead stars. Below them,<br>exactly at eye-level, were the squibs of the passing minute.<br>Eliot, Pound, Auden, Campbell, Day Lewis, Spender. Very damp<br>squibs, that lot. Dead stars above, damp squibs below. Shall we<br>ever again get a writer worth reading? But Lawrence was all right,<br>and Joyce even better before he went off his coconut. And if we<br>did get a writer worth reading, should we know him when we saw him,<br>so choked as we are with trash?<br><br>Ping! Shop bell. Gordon turned. Another customer.<br><br>A youth of twenty, cherry-lipped, with gilded hair, tripped<br>Nancifully in. Moneyed, obviously. He had the golden aura of<br>money. He had been in the shop before. Gordon assumed the<br>gentlemanly-servile mien reserved for new customers. He repeated<br>the usual formula:<br><br>'Good afternoon. Can I do anything for you? Are you looking for<br>any particular book?'<br><br>'Oh, no, not weally.' An R-less Nancy voice. 'May I just BWOWSE?<br>I simply couldn't wesist your fwont window. I have such a tewwible<br>weakness for bookshops! So I just floated in--tee-hee!'<br><br>Float out again, then, Nancy. Gordon smiled a cultured smile, as<br>booklover to booklover.<br><br>'Oh, please do. We like people to look round. Are you interested<br>in poetry, by any chance?'<br><br>'Oh, of course! I ADORE poetwy!'<br><br>Of course! Mangy little snob. There was a sub-artistic look about<br>his clothes. Gordon slid a 'slim' red volume from the poetry<br>shelves.<br><br>'These are just out. They might interest you, perhaps. They're<br>translations--something rather out of the common. Translations<br>from the Bulgarian.'<br><br>Very subtle, that. Now leave him to himself. That's the proper<br>way with customers. Don't hustle them; let them browse for twenty<br>minutes or so; then they get ashamed and buy something. Gordon<br>moved to the door, discreetly, keeping out of Nancy's way; yet<br>casually, one hand in his pocket, with the insouciant air proper to<br>a gentleman.<br><br>Outside, the slimy street looked grey and drear. From somewhere<br>round the corner came the clatter of hooves, a cold hollow sound.<br>Caught by the wind, the dark columns of smoke from the chimneys<br>veered over and rolled flatly down the sloping roofs. Ah!<br><br><br>Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over<br>The bending poplars, newly bare,<br>And the dark ribbons of the chimneys<br>Veer downward tumty tumty (something like 'murky') air.<br><br><br>Good. But the impulse faded. His eye fell again upon the ad-<br>posters across the street.<br><br>He almost wanted to laugh at them, they were so feeble, so dead-<br>alive, so unappetizing. As though anybody could be tempted by<br>THOSE! Like succubi with pimply backsides. But they depressed him<br>all the same. The money-stink, everywhere the money-stink. He<br>stole a glance at the Nancy, who had drifted away from the poetry<br>shelves and taken out a large expensive book on the Russian ballet.<br>He was holding it delicately between his pink non-prehensile paws,<br>as a squirrel holds a nut, studying the photographs. Gordon knew<br>his type. The moneyed 'artistic' young man. Not an artist<br>himself, exactly, but a hanger-on of the arts; frequenter of<br>studios, retailer of scandal. A nice-looking boy, though, for all<br>his Nancitude. The skin at the back of his neck was as silky-<br>smooth as the inside of a shell. You can't have a skin like that<br>under five hundred a year. A sort of charm he had, a glamour, like<br>all moneyed people. Money and charm; who shall separate them?<br><br>Gordon thought of Ravelston, his charming, rich friend, editor of<br>Antichrist, of whom he was extravagantly fond, and whom he did not<br>see so often as once in a fortnight; and of Rosemary, his girl, who<br>loved him--adored him, so she said--and who, all the same, had<br>never slept with him. Money, once again; all is money. All human<br>relationships must be purchased with money. If you have no money,<br>men won't care for you, women won't love you; won't, that is, care<br>for you or love you the last little bit that matters. And how<br>right they are, after all! For, moneyless, you are unlovable.<br>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels. But then,<br>if I haven't money, I DON'T speak with the tongues of men and of<br>angels.<br><br>He looked again at the ad-posters. He really hated them this time.<br>That Vitamalt one, for instance! 'Hike all day on a slab of<br>Vitamalt!' A youthful couple, boy and girl, in clean-minded hiking<br>kit, their hair picturesquely tousled by the wind, climbing a stile<br>against a Sussex landscape. That girl's face! The awful bright<br>tomboy cheeriness of it! The kind of girl who goes in for Plenty<br>of Clean Fun. Windswept. Tight khaki shorts but that doesn't mean<br>you can pinch her backside. And next to them--Corner Table.<br>'Corner Table enjoys his meal with Bovex'. Gordon examined the<br>thing with the intimacy of hatred. The idiotic grinning face, like<br>the face of a self-satisfied rat, the slick black hair, the silly<br>spectacles. Corner Table, heir of the ages; victor of Waterloo,<br>Corner Table, Modern man as his master want him to be. A docile<br>little porker, sitting in the money-sty, drinking Bovex.<br><br>Faces passed, wind-yellowed. A tram boomed across the square, and<br>the clock over the Prince of Wales struck three. A couple of old<br>creatures, a tramp or a beggar and his wife, in long greasy<br>overcoats that reached almost to the ground, were shuffling towards<br>the shop. Book-pinchers, by the look of them. Better keep an eye<br>on the boxes outside. The old man halted on the kerb a few yards<br>away while his wife came to the door. She pushed it open and<br>looked up at Gordon, between grey strings of hair, with a sort of<br>hopeful malevolence.<br><br>'Ju buy books?' she demanded hoarsely.<br><br>'Sometimes. It depends what books they are.'<br><br>'I gossome LOVELY books 'ere.'<br><br>She came in, shutting the door with a clang. The Nancy glanced<br>over his shoulder distastefully and moved a step or two away, into<br>the corner. The old woman had produced a greasy little sack from<br>under her overcoat. She moved confidentially nearer to Gordon.<br>She smelt of very, very old breadcrusts.<br><br>'Will you 'ave 'em?' she said, clasping the neck of the sack.<br>'Only 'alf a crown the lot.'<br><br>'What are they? Let me see them, please.'<br><br>'LOVELY books, they are,' she breathed, bending over to open the<br>sack and emitting a sudden very powerful whiff of breadcrusts.<br><br>''Ere!' she said, and thrust an armful of filthy-looking books<br>almost into Gordon's face.<br><br>They were an 1884 edition of Charlotte M. Yonge's novels, and had<br>the appearance of having been slept on for many years. Gordon<br>stepped back, suddenly revolted.<br><br>'We can't possibly buy those,' he said shortly.<br><br>'Can't buy 'em? WHY can't yer buy 'em?'<br><br>'Because they're no use to us. We can't sell that kind of thing.'<br><br>'Wotcher make me take 'em out o' me bag for, then?' demanded the<br>old woman ferociously.<br><br>Gordon made a detour round her, to avoid the smell, and held the<br>door open, silently. No use arguing. You had people of this type<br>coming into the shop all day long. The old woman made off,<br>mumbling, with malevolence in the hump of her shoulders, and joined<br>her husband. He paused on the kerb to cough, so fruitily that you<br>could hear him through the door. A clot of phlegm, like a little<br>white tongue, came slowly out between his lips and was ejected into<br>the gutter. Then the two old creatures shuffled away, beetle-like<br>in the long greasy overcoats that hid everything except their feet.<br><br>Gordon watched them go. They were just by-products. The throw-<br>outs of the money-god. All over London, by tens of thousands,<br>draggled old beasts of that description; creeping like unclean<br>beetles to the grave.<br><br>He gazed out at the graceless street. At this moment it seemed to<br>him that in a street like this, in a town like this, every life<br>that is lived must be meaningless and intolerable. The sense of<br>disintegration, of decay, that is endemic in our time, was strong<br>upon him. Somehow it was mixed up with the ad-posters opposite.<br>He looked now with more seeing eyes at those grinning yard-wide<br>faces. After all, there was more there than mere silliness, greed,<br>and vulgarity. Corner Table grins at you, seemingly optimistic,<br>with a flash of false teeth. But what is behind the grin?<br>Desolation, emptiness, prophecies of doom. For can you not see, if<br>you know how to look, that behind that slick self-satisfaction, that<br>tittering fat-bellied triviality, there is nothing but a frightful<br>emptiness, a secret despair? The great death-wish of the modern<br>world. Suicide pacts. Heads stuck in gas-ovens in lonely<br>maisonettes. French letters and Amen Pills. And the reverberations<br>of future wars. Enemy aeroplanes flying over London; the deep<br>threatening hum of the propellers, the shattering thunder of the<br>bombs. It is all written in Corner Table's face.<br><br>More customers coming. Gordon stood back, gentlemanly-servile.<br><br>The door-bell clanged. Two upper-middle-class ladies sailed<br>noisily in. One pink and fruity, thirty-fivish, with voluptuous<br>bosom burgeoning from her coat of squirrel-skin, emitting a super-<br>feminine scent of Parma violets: the other middle-aged, tough, and<br>curried--India, presumably. Close behind them a dark, grubby, shy<br>young man slipped through the doorway as apologetically as a cat.<br>He was one of the shop's best customers--a flitting, solitary<br>creature who was almost too shy to speak and who by some strange<br>manipulation kept himself always a day away from a shave.<br><br>Gordon repeated his formula:<br><br>'Good afternoon. Can I do anything for you? Are you looking for<br>any particular book?'<br><br>Fruity-face overwhelmed him with a smile, but curry-face decided to<br>treat the question as an impertinence. Ignoring Gordon, she drew<br>fruity-face across to the shelves next to the new books where the<br>dog-books and cat-books were kept. The two of them immediately<br>began taking books out of the shelves and talking loudly. Curry-<br>face had the voice of a drill-sergeant. She was no doubt a<br>colonel's wife, or widow. The Nancy, still deep in the big book on<br>the Russian ballet, edged delicately away. His face said that he<br>would leave the shop if his privacy were disturbed again. The shy<br>young man had already found his way to the poetry shelves. The two<br>ladies were fairly frequent visitors to the shop. They always<br>wanted to see books about cats and dogs, but never actually bought<br>anything. There were two whole shelves of dog-books and cat-books.<br>'Ladies' Corner,' old McKechnie called it.<br><br>Another customer arrived, for the library. An ugly girl of twenty,<br>hatless, in a white overall, with a sallow, blithering, honest face<br>and powerful spectacles that distorted her eyes. She was an<br>assistant at a chemist's shop. Gordon put on his homey library<br>manner. She smiled at him, and with a gait as clumsy as a bear's<br>followed him into the library.<br><br>'What kind of book would you like this time, Miss Weeks?'<br><br>'Well'--she clutched the front of her overall. Her distorted,<br>black-treacle eyes beamed trustfully into his. 'Well, what I'd<br>REALLY like's a good hot-stuff love story. You know--something<br>MODERN.'<br><br>'Something modern? Something by Barbara Bedworthy for instance?<br>Have you read Almost a Virgin?'<br><br>'Oh no, not her. She's too Deep. I can't bear Deep books. But I<br>want something--well, YOU know--MODERN. Sex-problems and divorce<br>and all that. YOU know.'<br><br>'Modern, but not Deep,' said Gordon, as lowbrow to lowbrow.<br><br>He ranged among the hot-stuff modern love-stories. There were not<br>less than three hundred of them in the library. From the front<br>room came the voices of the two upper-middle-class ladies, the one<br>fruity, the other curried, disputing about dogs. They had taken<br>out one of the dog-books and were examining the photographs.<br>Fruity-voice enthused over the photograph of a Peke, the ickle<br>angel pet, wiv his gweat big Soulful eyes and his ickle black<br>nosie--oh, so ducky-duck! But curry-voice--yes, undoubtedly a<br>colonel's widow--said Pekes were soppy. Give her dogs with guts--<br>dogs that would fight, she said; she hated these soppy lapdogs, she<br>said. 'You have no Soul, Bedelia, no Soul,' said fruity-voice<br>plaintively. The door-bell pinged again. Gordon handed the<br>chemist's girl Seven Scarlet Nights and booked it on her ticket.<br>She took a shabby leather purse out of her overall pocket and paid<br>him twopence.<br><br>He went back to the front room. The Nancy had put his book back in<br>the wrong shelf and vanished. A lean, straight-nosed, brisk woman,<br>with sensible clothes and gold-rimmed pince-nez--schoolmarm<br>possibly, feminist certainly--came in and demanded Mrs Wharton-<br>Beverley's history of the suffrage movement. With secret joy<br>Gordon told her that they hadn't got it. She stabbed his male<br>incompetence with gimlet eyes and went out again. The thin young<br>man stood apologetically in the corner, his face buried in D. H.<br>Lawrence's Collected Poems, like some long-legged bird with its<br>head buried under its wing.<br><br>Gordon waited by the door. Outside, a shabby-genteel old man with<br>a strawberry nose and a khaki muffler round his throat was picking<br>over the books in the sixpenny box. The two upper-middle-class<br>ladies suddenly departed, leaving a litter of open books on the<br>table. Fruity-face cast reluctant backward glances at the dog-<br>books, but curry-face drew her away, resolute not to buy anything.<br>Gordon held the door open. The two ladies sailed noisily out,<br>ignoring him.<br><br>He watched their fur-coated upper-middle-class backs go down the<br>street. The old strawberry-nosed man was talking to himself as he<br>pawed over the books. A bit wrong in the head, presumably. He<br>would pinch something if he wasn't watched. The wind blew colder,<br>drying the slime of the street. Time to light up presently.<br>Caught by a swirl of air, the torn strip of paper on the Q. T.<br>Sauce advertisement fluttered sharply, like a piece of washing on<br>the line. Ah!<br><br><br>Sharply the menacing wind sweeps over<br>The bending poplars, newly bare,<br>And the dark ribbons of the chimneys<br>Veer downward; flicked by whips of air<br>Torn posters flutter.<br><br><br>Not bad, not bad at all. But he had no wish to go on--could not go<br>on, indeed. He fingered the money in his pocket, not chinking it,<br>lest the shy young man should hear. Twopence-halfpenny. No<br>tobacco all tomorrow. His bones ached.<br><br>A light sprang up in the Prince of Wales. They would be swabbing<br>out the bar. The old strawberry-nosed man was reading an Edgar<br>Wallace out of the twopenny box. A tram boomed in the distance.<br>In the room upstairs Mr McKechnie, who seldom came down to the<br>shop, drowsed by the gas-fire, white-haired and white-bearded, with<br>snuff-box handy, over his calf-bound folio of Middleton's Travels<br>in the Levant.<br><br>The thin young man suddenly realized that he was alone and looked<br>up guiltily. He was a habitue of bookshops, yet never stayed<br>longer than ten minutes in any one shop. A passionate hunger for<br>books, and the fear of being a nuisance, were constantly at war in<br>him. After ten minutes in any shop he would grow uneasy, feel<br>himself de trop, and take to flight, having bought something out of<br>sheer nervousness. Without speaking he held out the copy of<br>Lawrence's poems and awkwardly extracted three florins from his<br>pocket. In handing them to Gordon he dropped one. Both dived for<br>it simultaneously; their heads bumped against one another. The<br>young man stood back, blushing sallowly.<br><br>'I'll wrap it up for you,' said Gordon.<br><br>But the shy young man shook his head--he stammered so badly that he<br>never spoke when it was avoidable. He clutched his book to him and<br>slipped out with the air of having committed some disgraceful<br>action.<br><br>Gordon was alone. He wandered back to the door. The strawberry-<br>nosed man glanced over his shoulder, caught Gordon's eye, and moved<br>off, foiled. He had been on the point of slipping Edgar Wallace<br>into his pocket. The clock over the Prince of Wales struck a<br>quarter past three.<br><br>Ding Dong! A quarter past three. Light up at half past. Four and<br>three-quarter hours till closing time. Five and a quarter hours<br>till supper. Twopence halfpenny in pocket. No tobacco tomorrow.<br><br>Suddenly a ravishing, irresistible desire to smoke came over<br>Gordon. He had made up his mind not to smoke this afternoon. He<br>had only four cigarettes left. They must be saved for tonight,<br>when he intended to 'write'; for he could no more 'write' without<br>tobacco than without air. Nevertheless, he had got to have a<br>smoke. He took out his packet of Player's Weights and extracted<br>one of the dwarfish cigarettes. It was sheer stupid indulgence; it<br>meant half an hour off tonight's 'writing' time. But there was no<br>resisting it. With a sort of shameful joy he sucked the soothing<br>smoke into his lungs.<br><br>The reflection of his own face looked back at him from the greyish<br>pane. Gordon Comstock, author of MICE; en l'an trentiesme de son<br>eage, and moth-eaten already. Only twenty-six teeth left.<br>However, Villon at the same age was poxed on his own showing.<br>Let's be thankful for small mercies.<br><br>He watched the ribbon of torn paper whirling, fluttering on the<br>Q. T. Sauce advertisement. Our civilization is dying. It MUST be<br>dying. But it isn't going to die in its bed. Presently the<br>aeroplanes are coming. Zoom--whizz--crash! The whole western<br>world going up in a roar of high explosives.<br><br>He looked at the darkening street, at the greyish reflection of his<br>face in the pane, at the shabby figures shuffling past. Almost<br>involuntarily he repeated:<br><br><br>'C'est l'Ennui--l'oeil charge d'un pleur involontaire,<br>Il reve d'echafauds en fumant son houka!'<br><br><br>Money, money! Corner Table! The humming of the aeroplanes and the<br>crash of the bombs.<br><br>Gordon squinted up at the leaden sky. Those aeroplanes are coming.<br>In imagination he saw them coming now; squadron after squadron,<br>innumerable, darkening the sky like clouds of gnats. With his<br>tongue not quite against his teeth he made a buzzing, bluebottle-<br>on-the-window-pane sound to represent the humming of the<br>aeroplanes. It was a sound which, at that moment, he ardently<br>desired to hear. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/0.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying/2.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
