<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">It was in Burma, a sodden morning of the rains. A sickly light, like<br>yellow tinfoil, was slanting over the high walls into the jail yard. We<br>were waiting outside the condemned cells, a row of sheds fronted with<br>double bars, like small animal cages. Each cell measured about ten feet<br>by ten and was quite bare within except for a plank bed and a pot of<br>drinking water. In some of them brown silent men were squatting at the<br>inner bars, with their blankets draped round them. These were the<br>condemned men, due to be hanged within the next week or two.<br><br>One prisoner had been brought out of his cell. He was a Hindu, a puny<br>wisp of a man, with a shaven head and vague liquid eyes. He had a thick,<br>sprouting moustache, absurdly too big for his body, rather like the<br>moustache of a comic man on the films. Six tall Indian warders were<br>guarding him and getting him ready for the gallows. Two of them stood by<br>with rifles and fixed bayonets, while the others handcuffed him, passed a<br>chain through his handcuffs and fixed it to their belts, and lashed his<br>arms tight to his sides. They crowded very close about him, with their<br>hands always on him in a careful, caressing grip, as though all the while<br>feeling him to make sure he was there. It was like men handling a fish<br>which is still alive and may jump back into the water. But he stood quite<br>unresisting, yielding his arms limply to the ropes, as though he hardly<br>noticed what was happening.<br><br>Eight o'clock struck and a bugle call, desolately thin in the wet air,<br>floated from the distant barracks. The superintendent of the jail, who<br>was standing apart from the rest of us, moodily prodding the gravel with<br>his stick, raised his head at the sound. He was an army doctor, with a<br>grey toothbrush moustache and a gruff voice. "For God's sake hurry up,<br>Francis," he said irritably. "The man ought to have been dead by this<br>time. Aren't you ready yet?"<br><br>Francis, the head jailer, a fat Dravidian in a white drill suit and gold<br>spectacles, waved his black hand. "Yes sir, yes sir," he bubbled. "All<br>iss satisfactorily prepared. The hangman iss waiting. We shall proceed."<br><br>"Well, quick march, then. The prisoners can't get their breakfast till<br>this job's over."<br><br>We set out for the gallows. Two warders marched on either side of the<br>prisoner, with their rifles at the slope; two others marched close<br>against him, gripping him by arm and shoulder, as though at once pushing<br>and supporting him. The rest of us, magistrates and the like, followed<br>behind. Suddenly, when we had gone ten yards, the procession stopped<br>short without any order or warning. A dreadful thing had happened--a<br>dog, come goodness knows whence, had appeared in the yard. It came<br>bounding among us with a loud volley of barks, and leapt round us wagging<br>its whole body, wild with glee at finding so many human beings together.<br>It was a large woolly dog, half Airedale, half pariah. For a moment it<br>pranced round us, and then, before anyone could stop it, it had made a<br>dash for the prisoner, and jumping up tried to lick his face. Everyone<br>stood aghast, too taken aback even to grab at the dog.<br><br>"Who let that bloody brute in here?" said the superintendent angrily.<br>"Catch it, someone!"<br><br>A warder, detached from the escort, charged clumsily after the dog, but<br>it danced and gambolled just out of his reach, taking everything as part<br>of the game. A young Eurasian jailer picked up a handful of gravel and<br>tried to stone the dog away, but it dodged the stones and came after us<br>again. Its yaps echoed from the jail wails. The prisoner, in the grasp of<br>the two warders, looked on incuriously, as though this was another<br>formality of the hanging. It was several minutes before someone managed<br>to catch the dog. Then we put my handkerchief through its collar and<br>moved off once more, with the dog still straining and whimpering.<br><br>It was about forty yards to the gallows. I watched the bare brown back of<br>the prisoner marching in front of me. He walked clumsily with his bound<br>arms, but quite steadily, with that bobbing gait of the Indian who never<br>straightens his knees. At each step his muscles slid neatly into place,<br>the lock of hair on his scalp danced up and down, his feet printed<br>themselves on the wet gravel. And once, in spite of the men who gripped<br>him by each shoulder, he stepped slightly aside to avoid a puddle on the<br>path.<br><br>It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to<br>destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to<br>avoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of<br>cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he<br>was alive just as we were alive. All the organs of his body were working<br>--bowels digesting food, skin renewing itself, nails growing, tissues<br>forming--all toiling away in solemn foolery. His nails would still be<br>growing when he stood on the drop, when he was falling through the air<br>with a tenth of a second to live. His eyes saw the yellow gravel and the<br>grey walls, and his brain still remembered, foresaw, reasoned--reasoned<br>even about puddles. He and we were a party of men walking together,<br>seeing, hearing, feeling, understanding the same world; and in two<br>minutes, with a sudden snap, one of us would be gone--one mind less, one<br>world less.<br><br>The gallows stood in a small yard, separate from the main grounds of the<br>prison, and overgrown with tall prickly weeds. It was a brick erection<br>like three sides of a shed, with planking on top, and above that two<br>beams and a crossbar with the rope dangling. The hangman, a grey-haired<br>convict in the white uniform of the prison, was waiting beside his<br>machine. He greeted us with a servile crouch as we entered. At a word<br>from Francis the two warders, gripping the prisoner more closely than<br>ever, half led, half pushed him to the gallows and helped him clumsily up<br>the ladder. Then the hangman climbed up and fixed the rope round the<br>prisoner's neck.<br><br>We stood waiting, five yards away. The warders had formed in a rough<br>circle round the gallows. And then, when the noose was fixed, the<br>prisoner began crying out on his god. It was a high, reiterated cry of<br>"Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!", not urgent and fearful like a prayer or a cry for<br>help, but steady, rhythmical, almost like the tolling of a bell. The dog<br>answered the sound with a whine. The hangman, still standing on the<br>gallows, produced a small cotton bag like a flour bag and drew it down<br>over the prisoner's face. But the sound, muffled by the cloth, still<br>persisted, over and over again: "Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!"<br><br>The hangman climbed down and stood ready, holding the lever. Minutes<br>seemed to pass. The steady, muffled crying from the prisoner went on and<br>on, "Ram! Ram! Ram!" never faltering for an instant. The superintendent,<br>his head on his chest, was slowly poking the ground with his stick;<br>perhaps he was counting the cries, allowing the prisoner a fixed number--<br>fifty, perhaps, or a hundred. Everyone had changed colour. The Indians<br>had gone grey like bad coffee, and one or two of the bayonets were<br>wavering. We looked at the lashed, hooded man on the drop, and listened<br>to his cries--each cry another second of life; the same thought was in<br>all our minds: oh, kill him quickly, get it over, stop that abominable<br>noise!<br><br>Suddenly the superintendent made up his mind. Throwing up his head he<br>made a swift motion with his stick. "Chalo!" he shouted almost fiercely.<br><br>There was a clanking noise, and then dead silence. The prisoner had<br>vanished, and the rope was twisting on itself. I let go of the dog, and<br>it galloped immediately to the back of the gallows; but when it got there<br>it stopped short, barked, and then retreated into a corner of the yard,<br>where it stood among the weeds, looking timorously out at us. We went<br>round the gallows to inspect the prisoner's body. He was dangling with<br>his toes pointed straight downwards, very slowly revolving, as dead as a<br>stone.<br><br>The superintendent reached out with his stick and poked the bare body; it<br>oscillated, slightly. "HE'S all right," said the superintendent. He<br>backed out from under the gallows, and blew out a deep breath. The moody<br>look had gone out of his face quite suddenly. He glanced at his<br>wrist-watch. "Eight minutes past eight. Well, that's all for this<br>morning, thank God."<br><br>The warders unfixed bayonets and marched away. The dog, sobered and<br>conscious of having misbehaved itself, slipped after them. We walked out<br>of the gallows yard, past the condemned cells with their waiting<br>prisoners, into the big central yard of the prison. The convicts, under<br>the command of warders armed with lathis, were already receiving their<br>breakfast. They squatted in long rows, each man holding a tin pannikin,<br>while two warders with buckets marched round ladling out rice; it seemed<br>quite a homely, jolly scene, after the hanging. An enormous relief had<br>come upon us now that the job was done. One felt an impulse to sing, to<br>break into a run, to snigger. All at once everyone began chattering<br>gaily.<br><br>The Eurasian boy walking beside me nodded towards the way we had come,<br>with a knowing smile: "Do you know, sir, our friend (he meant the dead<br>man), when he heard his appeal had been dismissed, he pissed on the floor<br>of his cell. From fright.--Kindly take one of my cigarettes, sir. Do you<br>not admire my new silver case, sir? From the boxwallah, two rupees eight<br>annas. Classy European style."<br><br>Several people laughed--at what, nobody seemed certain.<br><br>Francis was walking by the superintendent, talking garrulously. "Well,<br>sir, all hass passed off with the utmost satisfactoriness. It wass all<br>finished--flick! like that. It iss not always so--oah, no! I have known<br>cases where the doctor wass obliged to go beneath the gallows and pull<br>the prisoner's legs to ensure decease. Most disagreeable!"<br><br>"Wriggling about, eh? That's bad," said the superintendent.<br><br>"Ach, sir, it iss worse when they become refractory! One man, I recall,<br>clung to the bars of hiss cage when we went to take him out. You will<br>scarcely credit, sir, that it took six warders to dislodge him, three<br>pulling at each leg. We reasoned with him. "My dear fellow," we said,<br>"think of all the pain and trouble you are causing to us!" But no, he<br>would not listen! Ach, he wass very troublesome!"<br><br>I found that I was laughing quite loudly. Everyone was laughing. Even the<br>superintendent grinned in a tolerant way. "You'd better all come out and<br>have a drink," he said quite genially. "I've got a bottle of whisky in<br>the car. We could do with it."<br><br>We went through the big double gates of the prison, into the road.<br>"Pulling at his legs!" exclaimed a Burmese magistrate suddenly, and burst<br>into a loud chuckling. We all began laughing again. At that moment<br>Francis's anecdote seemed extraordinarily funny. We all had a drink<br>together, native and European alike, quite amicably. The dead man was a<br>hundred yards away.<br><br></font></p>
