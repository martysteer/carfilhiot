<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">It is Sunday afternoon, preferably before the war. The wife is already<br>asleep in the armchair, and the children have been sent out for a nice<br>long walk. You put your feet up on the sofa, settle your spectacles on<br>your nose, and open the NEWS OF THE WORLD. Roast beef and Yorkshire, or<br>roast pork and apple sauce, followed up by suet pudding and driven home,<br>as it were, by a cup of mahogany-brown tea, have put you in just the<br>right mood. Your pipe is drawing sweetly, the sofa cushions are soft<br>underneath you, the fire is well alight, the air is warm and stagnant. In<br>these blissful circumstances, what is it that you want to read about?<br><br>Naturally, about a murder. But what kind of murder? If one examines the<br>murders which have given the greatest amount of pleasure to the British<br>public, the murders whose story is known in its general outline to almost<br>everyone and which have been made into novels and re-hashed over and over<br>again by the Sunday papers, one finds a fairly strong family resemblance<br>running through the greater number of them. Our great period in murder,<br>our Elizabethan period, so to speak, seems to have been between roughly<br>1850 and 1925, and the murderers whose reputation has stood the test of<br>time are the following: Dr. Palmer of Rugely, Jack the Ripper, Neill<br>Cream, Mrs. Maybrick, Dr. Crippen, Seddon, Joseph Smith, Armstrong, and<br>Bywaters and Thompson. In addition, in 1919 or thereabouts, there was<br>another very celebrated case which fits into the general pattern but<br>which I had better not mention by name, because the accused man was<br>acquitted.<br><br>Of the above-mentioned nine cases, at least four have had successful<br>novels based on them, one has been made into a popular melodrama, and the<br>amount of literature surrounding them, in the form of newspaper<br>write-ups, criminological treatises and reminiscences by lawyers and<br>police officers, would make a considerable library. It is difficult to<br>believe that any recent English crime will be remembered so long and so<br>intimately, and not only because the violence of external events has made<br>murder seem unimportant, but because the prevalent type of crime seems to<br>be changing. The principal CAUSE CÉLÈBRE of the war years was the<br>so-called Cleft Chin Murder, which has now been written up in a popular<br>booklet; the verbatim account of the trial was published<br>some time last year by Messrs. Jarrolds with an introduction by<br>Mr. Bechhofer Roberts. Before returning to this pitiful and sordid case,<br>which is only interesting from a sociological and perhaps a legal point of<br>view, let me try to define what it is that the readers of Sunday papers<br>mean when they say fretfully that "you never seem to get a good murder<br>nowadays".<br><br>In considering the nine murders I named above, one can start by excluding<br>the Jack the Ripper case, which is in a class by itself. Of the other<br>eight, six were poisoning cases, and eight of the ten criminals belonged<br>to the middle class. In one way or another, sex was a powerful motive in<br>all but two cases, and in at least four cases respectability--the desire<br>to gain a secure position in life, or not to forfeit one's social<br>position by some scandal such as a divorce--was one of the main reasons<br>for committing murder. In more than half the cases, the object was to get<br>hold of a certain known sum of money such as a legacy or an insurance<br>policy, but the amount involved was nearly always small. In most of the<br>cases the crime only came to light slowly, as the result of careful<br>investigations which started off with the suspicions of neighbours or<br>relatives; and in nearly every case there was some dramatic coincidence,<br>in which the finger of Providence could be clearly seen, or one of those<br>episodes that no novelist would dare to make up, such as Crippen's flight<br>across the Atlantic with his mistress dressed as a boy, or Joseph Smith<br>playing "Nearer, my God, to Thee" on the harmonium while one of his wives<br>was drowning in the next room. The background of all these crimes, except<br>Neill Cream's, was essentially domestic; of twelve victims, seven were<br>either wife or husband of the murderer.<br><br>With all this in mind one can construct what would be, from a NEWS OF THE<br>WORLD reader's point of view, the "perfect" murder. The murderer should<br>be a little man of the professional class--a dentist or a solicitor, say<br>--living an intensely respectable life somewhere in the suburbs, and<br>preferably in a semi-detached house, which will allow the neighbours to<br>hear suspicious sounds through the wall. He should be either chairman of<br>the local Conservative Party branch, or a leading Nonconformist and<br>strong Temperance advocate. He should go astray through cherishing a<br>guilty passion for his secretary or the wife of a rival professional man,<br>and should only bring himself to the point of murder after long and<br>terrible wrestles with his conscience. Having decided on murder, he<br>should plan it all with the utmost cunning, and only slip up over some<br>tiny unforeseeable detail. The means chosen should, of course, be poison.<br>In the last analysis he should commit murder because this seems to him<br>less disgraceful, and less damaging to his career, than being detected in<br>adultery. With this kind of background, a crime can have dramatic and<br>even tragic qualities which make it memorable and excite pity for both<br>victim and murderer. Most of the crimes mentioned above have a touch of<br>this atmosphere, and in three cases, including the one I referred to but<br>did not name, the story approximates to the one I have outlined.<br><br>Now compare the Cleft Chin Murder. There is no depth of feeling in it. It<br>was almost chance that the two people concerned committed that particular<br>murder, and it was only by good luck that they did not commit several<br>others. The background was not domesticity, but the anonymous life of the<br>dance-halls and the false values of the American film. The two culprits<br>were an eighteen-year-old ex-waitress named Elizabeth Jones, and an<br>American army deserter, posing as an officer, named Karl Hulten. They<br>were only together for six days, and it seems doubtful whether, until<br>they were arrested, they even learned one another's true names. They met<br>casually in a teashop, and that night went out for a ride in a stolen<br>army truck. Jones described herself as a strip-tease artist, which was<br>not strictly true (she had given one unsuccessful performance in this<br>line); and declared that she wanted to do something dangerous, "like<br>being a gun-moll." Hulten described himself as a big-time Chicago<br>gangster, which was also untrue. They met a girl bicycling along the<br>road, and to show how tough he was Hulten ran over her with his truck,<br>after which the pair robbed her of the few shillings that were on her. On<br>another occasion they knocked out a girl to whom they had offered a lift,<br>took her coat and handbag and threw her into a river. Finally, in the<br>most wanton way, they murdered a taxi-driver who happened to have £8 in<br>his pocket. Soon afterwards they parted. Hulten was caught because he had<br>foolishly kept the dead man's car, and Jones made spontaneous confessions<br>to the police. In court each prisoner incriminated the other. In between<br>crimes, both of them seem to have behaved with the utmost callousness:<br>they spent the dead taxi-driver's £8 at the dog races.<br><br>Judging from her letters, the girl's case has a certain amount of<br>psychological interest, but this murder probably captured the headlines<br>because it provided distraction amid the doodle-bugs and the anxieties of<br>the Battle of France. Jones and Hulten committed their murder to the tune<br>of V1, and were convicted to the tune of V2. There was also considerable<br>excitement because--as has become usual in England--the man was<br>sentenced to death and the girl to imprisonment. According to Mr.<br>Raymond, the reprieving of Jones caused widespread indignation and<br>streams of telegrams to the Home Secretary: in her native town, "SHE<br>SHOULD HANG" was chalked on the walls beside pictures of a figure<br>dangling from a gallows. Considering that only ten women have been hanged<br>in Britain this century, and that the practice has gone out largely<br>because of popular feeling against it, it is difficult not to feel that<br>this clamour to hang an eighteen-year-old girl was due partly to the<br>brutalizing effects of war. Indeed, the whole meaningless story, with its<br>atmosphere of dance-halls, movie-palaces, cheap perfume, false names and<br>stolen cars, belongs essentially to a war period.<br><br>Perhaps it is significant that the most talked-of English murder of<br>recent years should have been committed by an American and an English<br>girl who had become partly Americanized. But it is difficult to believe<br>that this case will be so long remembered as the old domestic poisoning<br>dramas, product of a stable society where the all-prevailing hypocrisy<br>did at least ensure that crimes as serious as murder should have strong<br>emotions behind them.<br><br></font></p>
