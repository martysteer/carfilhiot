<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Whenever I read phrases like 'war guilt trials', 'punishment of war<br>criminals' and so forth, there comes back into my mind the memory of<br>something I saw in a prisoner-of-war camp in South Germany, earlier this<br>year.<br><br>Another correspondent and myself were being show round the camp by a<br>little Viennese Jew who had been enlisted in the branch of the American<br>army which deals with the interrogation of prisoners. He was an alert,<br>fair-haired, rather good-looking youth of about twenty-five, and<br>politically so much more knowledgeable than the average American officer<br>that it was a pleasure to be with him. The camp was on an airfield, and,<br>after we had been round the cages, our guide led us to a hangar where<br>various prisoners who were in a different category from the others were<br>being 'screened'.<br><br>Up at one end of the hangar about a dozen men were lying in a row on the<br>concrete floor. These, it was explained, were S.S. officers who had been<br>segregated from the other prisoners. Among them was a man in dingy<br>civilian clothes who was lying with his arm across his face and<br>apparently asleep. He had strange and horribly deformed feet. The two of<br>them were quite symmetrical, but they were clubbed out into an<br>extraordinary globular shape which made them more like a horse's hoof<br>than anything human. As we approached the group, the little Jew seemed to<br>be working himself up into a state of excitement.<br><br>'That's the real swine!' he said, and suddenly he lashed out with his<br>heavy army boot and caught the prostrate man a fearful kick right on the<br>bulge of one of his deformed feet.<br><br>'Get up, you swine!' he shouted as the man started out of sleep, and then<br>repeated something of the kind in German. The prisoner scrambled to his<br>feet and stood clumsily to attention. With the same air of working<br>himself up into a fury--indeed he was almost dancing up and down as he<br>spoke--the Jew told us the prisoner's history. He was a 'real' Nazi: his<br>party number indicated that he had been a member since the very early<br>days, and he had held a post corresponding to a General in the political<br>branch of the S.S. It could be taken as quite certain that he had had<br>charge of concentration camps and had presided over tortures and<br>hangings. In short, he represented everything that we had been fighting<br>against during the past five years.<br><br>Meanwhile, I was studying his appearance. Quite apart from the scrubby,<br>unfed, unshaven look that a newly captured man generally has, he was a<br>disgusting specimen. But he did not look brutal or in any way<br>frightening: merely neurotic and, in a low way, intellectual. His pale,<br>shifty eyes were deformed by powerful spectacles. He could have been an<br>unfrocked clergyman, an actor ruined by drink, or a spiritualist medium.<br>I have seen very similar people in London common lodging houses, and also<br>in the Reading Room of the British Museum. Quite obviously he was<br>mentally unbalanced--indeed, only doubtfully sane, though at this moment<br>sufficiently in his right mind to be frightened of getting another kick.<br>And yet everything that the Jew was telling me of his history could have<br>been true, and probably was true! So the Nazi torturer of one's<br>imagination, the monstrous figure against whom one had struggled for so<br>many years, dwindled to this pitiful wretch, whose obvious need was not<br>for punishment, but for some kind of psychological treatment.<br><br>Later, there were further humiliations. Another S.S. officer, a large<br>brawny man, was ordered to strip to the waist and show the blood group<br>number tattooed on his under-arm; another was forced to explain to us how<br>he had lied about being a member of the S.S. and attempted to pass<br>himself off as an ordinary soldier of the Wehrmacht. I wondered whether<br>the Jew was getting any real kick out of this new-found power that he was<br>exercising. I concluded that he wasn't really enjoying it, and that he<br>was merely--like a man in a brothel, or a boy smoking his first cigar,<br>or a tourist traipsing round a picture gallery--TELLING himself that he<br>was enjoying it, and behaving as he had planned to behave in the days he<br>was helpless.<br><br>It is absurd to blame any German or Austrian Jew for getting his own back<br>on the Nazis. Heaven knows what scores this particular man may have had<br>to wipe out; very likely his whole family had been murdered; and after<br>all, even a wanton kick to a prisoner is a very tiny thing compared with<br>the outrages committed by the Hitler régime. But what this scene, and<br>much else that I saw in Germany, brought home to me was that the whole<br>idea of revenge and punishment is a childish daydream. Properly speaking,<br>there is no such thing as revenge. Revenge is an act which you want to<br>commit when you are powerless and because you are powerless: as soon as<br>the sense of impotence is removed, the desire evaporates also.<br><br>Who would not have jumped for joy, in 1940, at the thought of seeing S.S.<br>officers kicked and humiliated? But when the thing becomes possible, it<br>is merely pathetic and disgusting. It is said that when Mussolini's<br>corpse was exhibited in public, an old woman drew a revolver and fired<br>five shots into it, exclaiming, 'Those are for my five sons!' It is the<br>kind of story that the newspapers make up, but it might be true. I wonder<br>how much satisfaction she got out of those five shots, which, doubtless,<br>she had dreamed years earlier of firing. The condition of her being able<br>to get close enough to Mussolini to shoot at him was that he should be a<br>corpse.<br><br>In so far as the big public in this country is responsible for the<br>monstrous peace settlement now being forced on Germany, it is because of<br>a failure to see in advance that punishing an enemy brings no<br>satisfaction. We acquiesce in crimes like the expulsion of all Germans<br>from East Prussia--crimes which in some cases we could not prevent but<br>might at least have protested against--because the Germans had angered<br>and frightened us, and therefore we were certain that when they were down<br>we should feel no pity for them. We persist in these policies, or let<br>others persist in them on our behalf, because of a vague feeling that,<br>having set out to punish Germany, we ought to go ahead and do it.<br>Actually there is little acute hatred of Germany left in this country,<br>and even less, I should expect to find, in the army of occupation. Only<br>the minority of sadists, who must have their 'atrocities' from one source<br>or another, take a keen interest in the hunting-down of war criminals and<br>quislings. If you asked the average man what crime Goering, Ribbentrop,<br>and the rest are to be charged with at their trial, he cannot tell you.<br>Somehow the punishment of these monsters ceases to sem attractive when it<br>becomes possible: indeed, once under lock and key, they almost cease to<br>be monsters.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is often a need of some concrete incident before one<br>can discover the real state of one's feelings. Here is another memory<br>from Germany. A few hours after Stuttgart was captured by the French<br>army, a Belgian journalist and myself entered the town, which was still<br>in some disorder. The Belgian had been broadcasting throughout the war<br>for the European Service of the BBC, and, like nearly all Frenchmen or<br>Belgians, he had a very much tougher attitude towards 'the Boche' than an<br>Englishman or an American would have. All the main bridges into town had<br>been blown up, and we had to enter by a small footbridge which the<br>Germans had evidently mad efforts to defend. A dead German soldier was<br>lying supine at the foot of the steps. His face was a waxy yellow. On his<br>breast someone had laid a bunch of the lilac which was blooming<br>everywhere.<br><br>The Belgian averted his face as we went past. When we were well over the<br>bridge he confided to me that this was the first time he had seen a dead<br>man. I suppose he was thirty five years old, and for four years he had<br>been doing war propaganda over the radio. For several days after this,<br>his attitude was quite different from what it had been earlier. He looked<br>with disgust at the bomb-wrecked town and the humiliation the Germans<br>were undergoing, and even on one occasion intervened to prevent a<br>particularly bad bit of looting. When he left, he gave the residue of the<br>coffee we had brought with us to the Germans on whom we were billeted. A<br>week earlier he would probably have been scandalized at the idea of<br>giving coffee to a 'Boche'. But his feelings, he told me, had undergone a<br>change at the sight of ce pauvre mort beside the bridge: it had suddenly<br>brought home to him the meaning of war. And yet, if we had happened to<br>enter the town by another route, he might have been spared the experience<br>of seeing one corpse out of the--perhaps--twenty million that the war<br>has produced.<br><br></font></p>
