<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The reappearance of HELEN'S BABIES, in its day one of the most popular<br>books in the world--within the British Empire alone it was pirated by<br>twenty different publishing firms, the author receiving a total profit of<br>£40 from a sale of some hundreds of thousands or millions of copies--will<br>ring a bell in any literate person over thirty-five. Not that the present<br>edition is an altogether satisfactory one. It is a cheap little book with<br>rather unsuitable illustrations, various American dialect words appear to<br>have been cut out of it, and the sequel, OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN, which<br>was often bound up with it in earlier editions, is missing. Still, it is<br>pleasant to see HELEN'S BABIES in print again. It had become almost a<br>rarity in recent years, and it is one of the best of the little library<br>of American books on which people born at about the turn of the century<br>were brought up.<br><br>The books one reads in childhood, and perhaps most of all the bad and<br>good bad books, create in one's mind a sort of false map of the world, a<br>series of fabulous countries into which one can retreat at odd moments<br>throughout the rest of life, and which in some cases can even survive a<br>visit to the real countries which they are supposed to represent. The<br>pampas, the Amazon, the coral islands of the Pacific, Russia, land of<br>birch-tree and samovar, Transylvania with its boyars and vampires, the<br>China of Guy Boothby, the Paris of du Maurier--one could continue the list<br>for a long time. But one other imaginary country that I acquired early in<br>life was called America. If I pause on the word "America", and,<br>deliberately putting aside the existing reality, call up my childhood<br>vision of it, I see two pictures--composite pictures, of course, from<br>which I am omitting a good deal of the detail.<br><br>One is of a boy sitting in a whitewashed stone schoolroom. He wears<br>braces and has patches on his shirt, and if it is summer he is<br>barefooted. In the corner of the school room there is a bucket of<br>drinking water with a dipper. The boy lives in a farm-house, also of<br>stone and also whitewashed, which has a mortgage on it. He aspires to be<br>President, and is expected to keep the woodpile full. Somewhere in the<br>background of the picture, but completely dominating it, is a huge black<br>Bible. The other picture is of a tall, angular man, with a shapeless hat<br>pulled down over his eyes, leaning against a wooden paling and whittling<br>at a stick. His lower jaw moves slowly but ceaselessly. At very long<br>intervals he emits some piece of wisdom such as "A woman is the orneriest<br>critter there is, 'ceptin' a mule", or "When you don't know a thing to<br>do, don't do a thing"; but more often it is a jet of tobacco juice that<br>issues from the gap in his front teeth. Between them those two pictures<br>summed up my earliest impression of America. And of the two, the<br>first--which, I suppose, represented New England, the other representing<br>the South--had the stronger hold upon me.<br><br>The books from which these pictures were derived included, of course,<br>books which it is still possible to take seriously, such as TOM SAWYER<br>and UNCLE TOM'S CABIN, but the most richly American flavour was to be<br>found in minor works which are now almost forgotten. I wonder, for<br>instance, if anyone still reads REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM, which<br>remained a popular favourite long enough to be filmed with Mary Pickford<br>in the leading part. Or how about the "Katy" books by Susan Coolidge<br>(WHAT KATY DID AT SCHOOL, etc), which, although girls' books and<br>therefore "soppy", had the fascination of foreignness? Louisa M. Alcott's<br>LITTLE WOMEN and GOOD WIVES are, I suppose, still flickeringly in print,<br>and certainly they still have their devotees. As a child I loved both of<br>them, though I was less pleased by the third of the trilogy, LITTLE MEN.<br>That model school where the worst punishment was to have to whack the<br>schoolmaster, on "this hurts me more than it hurts you" principles, was<br>rather difficult to swallow.<br><br>HELEN'S BABIES belonged in much the same world as LITTLE WOMEN, and must<br>have been published round about the same date. Then there were Artemus<br>Ward, Bret Harte, and various songs, hymns and ballads, besides poems<br>dealing with the civil war, such as "Barbara Fritchie" ("Shoot if you<br>must this old grey head, But spare your country's flag,' she said") and<br>"Little Gifford of Tennessee". There were other books so obscure that it<br>hardly seems worth mentioning them, and magazine stories of which I<br>remember nothing except that the old homestead always seemed to have a<br>mortgage on it. There was also BEAUTIFUL JOE, the American reply to BLACK<br>BEAUTY, of which you might just possibly pick up a copy in a sixpenny<br>box. All the books I have mentioned were written well before 1900, but<br>something of the special American flavour lingered on into this century<br>in, for instance, the Buster Brown coloured supplements, and even in<br>Booth Tarkington's "Penrod" stories, which will have been written round<br>about 1910. Perhaps there was even a tinge of it in Ernest Thompson<br>Seton's animal books (WILD ANIMALS I HAVE KNOWN, etc), which have now<br>fallen from favour but which drew tears from the pre-1914 child as surely<br>as MISUNDERSTOOD had done from the children of a generation earlier.<br><br>Somewhat later my picture of nineteenth-century America was given greater<br>precision by a song which is still fairly well known and which can be<br>found (I think) in the SCOTTISH STUDENTS' SONG BOOK. As usual in these<br>bookless days I cannot get hold of a copy, and I must quote fragments<br>from memory. It begins:<br><br>Riding down from Bangor<br>On an Eastern train,<br>Bronzed with weeks of hunting<br>In the woods of Maine<br>Quite extensive whiskers,<br>Beard, moustache as well<br>Sat a student fellow,<br>Tall and slim and swell.<br><br>Presently an aged couple and a "village maiden", described as "beautiful,<br>petite", get into the carriage. Quantities of cinders are flying about,<br>and before long the student fellow gets one in his eye: the village<br>maiden extracts it for him, to the scandal of the aged couple. Soon after<br>this the train shoots into a long tunnel, "black as Egypt's night". When<br>it emerges into the daylight again the maiden is covered with blushes,<br>and the cause of her confusion is revealed when<br><br>There suddenly appeared<br>A tiny little ear-ring<br>In that horrid student's beard!<br><br>I do not know the date of the song, but the primitiveness of the train<br>(no lights in the carriage, and a cinder in one's eye a normal accident)<br>suggests that it belongs well back in the nineteenth century.<br><br>What connects this song with books like HELEN'S BABIES is first of all a<br>sort of sweet innocence--the climax, the thing you are supposed to be<br>slightly shocked at, is an episode with which any modern piece of<br>naughty-naughty would START--and, secondly, a faint vulgarity of language<br>mixed up with a certain cultural pretentiousness. HELEN'S BABIES is<br>intended as a humorous, even a farcical book, but it is haunted all the<br>way through by words like "tasteful" and "ladylike", and it is funny<br>chiefly because its tiny disasters happen against a background of<br>conscious gentility. "Handsome, intelligent, composed, tastefully<br>dressed, without a suspicion of the flirt or the languid woman of fashion<br>about her, she awakened to the utmost my every admiring sentiment"--thus<br>is the heroine described, figuring elsewhere as "erect, fresh, neat,<br>composed, bright-eyed, fairfaced, smiling and observant". One gets<br>beautiful glimpses of a now-vanished world in such remarks as: "I believe<br>you arranged the floral decorations at St Zephaniah's Fair last winter,<br>Mr Burton? 'Twas the most tasteful display of the season." But in spite<br>of the occasional use of "'twas" and other archaisms--"parlour" for<br>sitting-room, "chamber" for bedroom, "real" as an adverb, and so<br>forth--the book does not "date" very markedly, and many of its admirers<br>imagine it to have been written round about 1900. Actually it was written<br>in 1875, a fact which one might infer from internal evidence, since the<br>hero, aged twenty-eight, is a veteran of the civil war.<br><br>The book is very short and the story is a simple one. A young bachelor is<br>prevailed on by his sister to look after her house and her two sons, aged<br>five and three, while she and her husband go on a fortnight's holiday.<br>The children drive him almost mad by an endless succession of such acts<br>as falling into ponds, swallowing poison, throwing keys down wells,<br>cutting themselves with razors, and the like, but also facilitate his<br>engagement to "a charming girl, whom, for about a year, I had been<br>adoring from afar". These events take place in an outer suburb of New<br>York, in a society which now seems astonishingly sedate, formal,<br>domesticated and, according to current conceptions, un-American. Every<br>action is governed by etiquette. To pass a carriage full of ladies when<br>your hat is crooked is an ordeal; to recognise an acquaintance in church<br>is ill-bred; to become engaged after a ten days' courtship is a severe<br>social lapse. We are accustomed to thinking of American society as more<br>crude, adventurous and, in a cultural sense, democratic than our own, and<br>from writers like Mark Twain, Whitman and Bret Harte, not to mention the<br>cowboy and Red Indian stories of the weekly papers, one draws a picture<br>of a wild anarchic world peopled by eccentrics and desperadoes who have<br>no traditions and no attachment to one place. That aspect of<br>nineteenth-century America did of course exist, but in the more populous<br>eastern States a society similar to Jane Austen's seems to have survived<br>longer than it did in England. And it is hard not to feel that it was a<br>better kind of society than that which arose from the sudden<br>industrialisation of the later part of the century. The people in HELEN'S<br>BABIES or LITTLE WOMEN may be mildly ridiculous, but they are<br>uncorrupted. They have something that is perhaps best described as<br>integrity, or good morale, founded partly on an unthinking piety. It is a<br>matter of course that everyone attends church on Sunday morning and says<br>grace before meals and prayers at bedtime: to amuse the children one<br>tells them Bible stories, and if they ask for a song it is probably<br>"Glory, glory Hallelujah". Perhaps it is also a sign of spiritual health<br>in the light literature of this period that death is mentioned freely.<br>"Baby Phil", the brother of Budge and Toddie, has died shortly before<br>HELEN'S BABIES opens, and there are various tear-jerking references to<br>his "tiny coffin". A modern writer attempting a story of this kind would<br>have kept coffins out of it<br><br>English children are still americanised by way of the films, but it would<br>no longer be generally claimed that American books are the best ones for<br>children. Who, without misgivings, would bring up a child on the coloured<br>"comics" in which sinister professors manufacture atomic bombs in<br>underground laboratories while Superman whizzes through the clouds, the<br>machine-gun bullets bouncing off his chest like peas, and platinum<br>blondes are raped, or very nearly, by steel robots and fifty-foot<br>dinosaurs? It is a far cry from Superman to the Bible and the woodpile.<br>The earlier children's books, or books readable by children, had not only<br>innocence but a sort of native gaiety, a buoyant, carefree feeling, which<br>was the product, presumably, of the unheard-of freedom and security which<br>nineteenth-century America enjoyed. That is the connecting link between<br>books so seemingly far apart as LITTLE WOMEN and LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI.<br>The society described in the one is subdued, bookish and home-loving,<br>while the other tells of a crazy world of bandits, gold mines, duels,<br>drunkenness and gambling hells: but in both one can detect an underlying<br>confidence in the future, a sense of freedom and opportunity.<br><br>Nineteenth-century America was a rich, empty country which lay outside<br>the main stream of world events, and in which the twin nightmares that<br>beset nearly every modern man, the nightmare of unemployment and the<br>nightmare of State interference, had hardly come into being. There were<br>social distinctions, more marked than those of today, and there was<br>poverty (in LITTLE WOMEN, it will be remembered, the family is at one<br>time so hard up that one of the girls sells her hair to the barber), but<br>there was not, as there is now, an all-prevailing sense of helplessness.<br>There was room for everybody, and if you worked hard you could be certain<br>of a living--could even be certain of growing rich: this was generally<br>believed, and for the greater part of the population it was even broadly<br>true. In other words, the civilisation of nineteenth-century America was<br>capitalist civilisation at its best. Soon after the civil war the<br>inevitable deterioration started. But for some decades, at least, life in<br>America was much better fun than life in Europe--there was more happening,<br>more colour, more variety, more opportunity--and the books and songs of<br>that period had a sort of bloom, a childlike quality. Hence, I think, the<br>popularity of HELEN'S BABIES and other "light" literature, which made it<br>normal for the English child of thirty or forty years ago to grow up with<br>a theoretical knowledge of racoons, woodchucks, chipmunks, gophers,<br>hickory trees, water-melons and other unfamiliar fragments of the<br>American scene.<br><br></font></p>
