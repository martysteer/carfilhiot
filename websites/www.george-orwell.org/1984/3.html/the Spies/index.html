<h2>Part 1, Chapter 4</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">4<br>With <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> deep, unconscious sigh which not even <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> nearness of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day's work started, Winston pulled <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> speakwrite towards him, blew <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> dust from its mouthpiece, and put on his spectacles. Then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> pneumatic tube on <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> right-hand side of his desk.<br><br>In <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> walls of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> cubicle there were three orifices. To <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> right of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> left, a larger one for newspapers; and in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> side wall, within easy reach of Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> flap of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> recesses of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> building.<br><br>Winston examined <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> four slips of paper which he had unrolled. Each contained a message of only one or two lines, in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> abbreviated jargon -- not actually Newspeak, but consisting largely of Newspeak words -- which was used in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Ministry for internal purposes. They ran:<br><br>times 17.3.84 bb speech malreported africa rectify<br><br>times 19.12.83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify current issue<br><br>times 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify<br><br>times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling<br><br>With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> fourth message aside. It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last. <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> other three were routine matters, though <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures.<br><br>Winston dialled 'back numbers' on <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> telescreen and called for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> appropriate issues of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> Times, which slid out of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> pneumatic tube after only a few minutes' delay. <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> official phrase had it, to rectify. For example, it appeared from <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> Times of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> seventeenth of March that Big Brother, in his speech of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> previous day, had predicted that <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> South Indian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in North Africa. As it happened, <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Eurasian Higher Command had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. It was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother's speech, in such a way as to make him predict <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> thing that had actually happened. Or again, <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> Times of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> nineteenth of December had published <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> official forecasts of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> output of various classes of consumption goods in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> fourth quarter of 1983, which was also <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> sixth quarter of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Ninth Three-Year Plan. Today's issue contained a statement of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> actual output, from which it appeared that <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. Winston's job was to rectify <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> original figures by making them agree with <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> later ones. As for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short a time ago as February, <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a 'categorical pledge' were <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> official words) that there would be no reduction of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> end of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> present week. All that was needed was to substitute for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> ration at some time in April.<br><br>As soon as Winston had dealt with each of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> appropriate copy of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> Times and pushed them into <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> memory hole to be devoured by <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> flames.<br><br>What happened in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> unseen labyrinth to which <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> Times had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> original copy destroyed, and <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> corrected copy placed on <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> files in its stead. This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs -- to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> needs of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place. <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> largest section of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Records Department, far larger than <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> one on which Winston worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction. A number of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> Times which might, because of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> files bearing its original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. Books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made. Even <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> written instructions which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed: always <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> reference was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> interests of accuracy.<br><br>But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Ministry of Plenty's figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> real world, not even <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great deal of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For example, <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> output of boots for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> quarter at one-hundred-and-forty-five million pairs. <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> forecast, marked <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> usual claim that <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> truth than fifty-seven millions, or than one-hundred-and-forty-five millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> date of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> year had become uncertain.<br><br>Winston glanced across <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> hall. In <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> corresponding cubicle on <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> other side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named Tillotson was working steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> mouthpiece of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> speakwrite. He had <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> telescreen. He looked up, and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winston's direction.<br><br>Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed on. People in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs. In <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name, though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> corridors or gesticulating in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> cubicle next to him <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Press <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. There was a certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier. And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy creature named Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and metres, was engaged in producing garbled versions -- definitive texts, they were called -- of poems which had become ideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another were to be retained in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> anthologies. And this hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> huge complexity of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There were <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> huge printing-shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts, and their elaborately equipped studios for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> faking of photographs. There was <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. There were <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall. There were <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> vast repositories where <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> corrected documents were stored, and <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> hidden furnaces where <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> original copies were destroyed. And somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> directing brains who co-ordinated <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> whole effort and laid down <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> past should be preserved, that one falsified, and <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> other rubbed out of existence.<br><br>And <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Records Department, after all, was itself only a single branch of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> past but to supply <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> citizens of Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen programmes, plays, novels -- with every conceivable kind of information, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan, from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a child's spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Ministry had not only to supply <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> multifarious needs of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> party, but also to repeat <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> whole operation at a lower level for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> benefit of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> proletariat. There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime and astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. There was even a whole sub-section -- Pornosec, it was called in Newspeak -- engaged in producing <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets and which no Party member, other than those who worked on it, was permitted to look at.<br><br>Three messages had slid out of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> pneumatic tube while Winston was working, but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them before <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Two Minutes Hate interrupted him. When <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Hate was over he returned to his cubicle, took <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Newspeak dictionary from <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> shelf, pushed <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> speakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his main job of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> morning.<br><br>Winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Most of it was a tedious routine, but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> depths of a mathematical problem -- delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> principles of Ingsoc and your estimate of what <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Party wanted you to say. Winston was good at this kind of thing. On occasion he had even been entrusted with <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> rectification of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> Times leading articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak. He unrolled <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> message that he had set aside earlier. It ran:<br><br>times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling<br><br>In Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered:<br><br <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> reporting of Big Brother's Order for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Day in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> Times of December 3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non-existent persons. Rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing.<br><br>Winston read through <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> offending article. Big Brother's Order for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> work of an organization known as FFCC, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> sailors in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, a prominent member of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Inner Party, had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration, <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Order of Conspicuous Merit, Second Class.<br><br>Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given. One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> matter in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Press or on <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> telescreen. That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced. <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> great purges involving thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed, were special show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years. More commonly, people who had incurred <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> displeasure of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> smallest clue as to what had happened to them. In some cases they might not even be dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another.<br><br>Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> cubicle across <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite. He raised his head for a moment: again <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> hostile spectacle-flash. Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> same job as himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person: on <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> other hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said. And presently some master brain in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Inner Party would select this version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> complex processes of cross-referencing that would be required, and then <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> chosen lie would pass into <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> permanent records and become truth.<br><br>Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced. Perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordinate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps -- what was likeliest of all -- <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> mechanics of government. <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> only real clue lay in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> words 'refs unpersons', which indicated that Withers was already dead. You could not invariably assume this to be <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> case when people were arrested. Sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed. Very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever. Withers, however, was already an unperson. He did not exist: he had never existed. Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> tendency of Big Brother's speech. It was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject.<br><br>He might turn <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> speech into <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> usual denunciation of traitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a victory at <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> front, or some triumph of over-production in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Ninth Three-Year Plan, might complicate <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> records too much. What was needed was a piece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready made as it were, <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances. There were occasions when Big Brother devoted his Order for <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Day to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file Party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed. To-day he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It was true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence.<br><br>Winston thought for a moment, then pulled <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> speakwrite towards him and began dictating in Big Brother's familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them ('What lessons do we learn from this fact, comrades? <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">The</B> lesson -- which is also one of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> fundamental principles of Ingsoc -- that,' etc., etc.), easy to imitate.<br><br>At <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. At six -- a year early, by a special relaxation of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> rules -- he had joined <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> <B style="color:black;background-color:#FFCC33">Spies</B>  at nine he had been a troop leader. At eleven he had denounced his uncle to <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Thought Police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies. At seventeen he had been a district organizer of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Junior Anti-Sex League. At nineteen he had designed a hand-grenade which had been adopted by <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, had killed thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one burst. At twenty-three he had perished in action. Pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Indian Ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> helicopter into deep water, despatches and all -- an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> purity and single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy's life. He was a total abstainer and a non-smoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> gymnasium, and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty. He had no subjects of conversation except <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> principles of Ingsoc, and no aim in life except <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> defeat of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Eurasian enemy and <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> hunting-down of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FFCC33">spies</B>  saboteurs, thought-criminals, and traitors generally.<br><br>Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> Order of Conspicuous Merit: in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> end he decided against it because of <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail.<br><br>Once again he glanced at his rival in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> opposite cubicle. Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> same job as himself. There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> present, now existed in <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> past, and when once <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon <B style="color:black;background-color:#FF9900">the</B> same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/2.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/4.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
