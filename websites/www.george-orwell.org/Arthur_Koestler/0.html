<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">One striking fact about English literature during the present century is<br>the extent to which it has been dominated by foreigners--for example,<br>Conrad, Henry James, Shaw, Joyce, Yeats, Pound and Eliot. Still, if you<br>chose to make this a matter of national prestige and examine our<br>achievement in the various branches of literature, you would find that<br>England made a fairly good showing until you came to what may be roughly<br>described as political writing, or pamphleteering. I mean by this the<br>special class of literature that has arisen out of the European<br>political struggle since the rise of Fascism. Under this heading novels,<br>autobiographies, books of "reportage", sociological treatises and plain<br>pamphlets can all be lumped together, all of them having a common origin<br>and to a great extent the same emotional atmosphere.<br><br>Some out of the outstanding figures in this school of writers are<br>Silone, Malraux, Salvemini, Borkenau, Victor Serge and Koestler himself.<br>Some of these are imaginative writers, some not, but they are all alike<br>in that they are trying to write contemporary history, but UNOFFICIAL<br>history, the kind that is ignored in the text-books and lied about in<br>the newspapers. Also they are all alike in being continental Europeans.<br>It may be an exaggeration, but it cannot be a very great one, to say<br>that whenever a book dealing with totalitarianism appears in this<br>country, and still seems worth reading six months after publication, it<br>is a book translated from some foreign language. English writers, over<br>the past dozen years, have poured forth an enormous spate of political<br>literature, but they have produced almost nothing of aesthetic value,<br>and very little of historical value either. The Left Book Club, for<br>instance, has been running ever since 1936. How many of its chosen<br>volumes can you even remember the names of? Nazi Germany, Soviet<br>Russia, Spain, Abyssinia, Austria, Czechoslovakia--all that these and<br>kindred subjects have produced, in England, are slick books of<br>reportage, dishonest pamphlets in which propaganda is swallowed whole<br>and then spewed up again, half digested, and a very few reliable guide<br>books and text-books. There has been nothing resembling, for instance,<br>FONTAMARA or DARKNESS AT NOON, because there is almost no English writer<br>to whom it has happened to see totalitarianism from the inside. In<br>Europe, during the past decade and more, things have been happening to<br>middle-class people which in England do not even happen to the working<br>class. Most of the European writers I mentioned above, and scores of<br>others like them, have been obliged to break the law in order to engage<br>in politics at all; some of them have thrown bombs and fought in street<br>battles, many have been in prison or the concentration camp, or fled<br>across frontiers with false names and forged passports. One cannot<br>imagine, say, Professor Laski indulging in activities of that kind.<br>England is lacking, therefore, in what one might call concentration-camp<br>literature. The special world created by secret-police forces,<br>censorship of opinion, torture and frame-up trials is, of course, known<br>about and to some extent disapproved of, but it has made very little<br>emotional impact. One result of this is that there exists in England<br>almost no literature of disillusionment about the Soviet Union. There is<br>the attitude of ignorant disapproval, and there is the attitude of<br>uncritical admiration, but very little in between. Opinion on the Moscow<br>sabotage trials, for instance, was divided, but divided chiefly on the<br>question of whether the accused were guilty. Few people were able to see<br>that, whether justified or not, the trials were an unspeakable horror.<br>And English disapproval of the Nazi outrages has also been an unreal<br>thing, turned on and off like a tap according to political expediency.<br>To understand such things one has to be able to imagine oneself as the<br>victim, and for an Englishman to write Darkness at Noon would be as<br>unlikely an accident as for a slave-trader to write UNCLE TOM'S CABIN.<br><br>Koestler's published work really centres about the Moscow trials. His<br>main theme is the decadence of revolutions owing to the corrupting<br>effects of power, but the special nature of the Stalin dictatorship has<br>driven him back into a position not far removed from pessimistic<br>Conservatism. I do not know how many books he has written in all. He is<br>a Hungarian whose earlier books were written in German, and five books<br>have been published in England: SPANISH TESTAMENT, THE GLADIATORS,<br>DARKNESS AT NOON, SCUM. OF THE EARTH, and ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE. The<br>subject-matter of all of them is similar, and none of them ever escapes<br>for more than a few pages from the atmosphere of nightmare. Of the five<br>books, the action of three takes place entirely or almost entirely in<br>prison.<br><br>In the opening months of the Spanish civil war Koestler was the NEWS<br>CHRONICLE'S correspondent in Spain, and early in 1937 he was taken<br>prisoner when the Fascists captured Malaga. He was nearly shot out of<br>hand, then spent some months imprisoned in a fortress, listening every<br>night to the roar of rifle fire as batch after batch of Republicans was<br>executed, and being most of the time in acute danger of execution<br>himself. This was not a chance adventure which "might have happened to<br>anybody", but was in accordance with Koestler's life-style. A<br>politically indifferent person would not have been in Spain at that<br>date, a more cautious observer would have got out of Malaga before the<br>Fascists arrived, and a British or American newspaper man would have<br>been treated with more consideration. The book that Koestler wrote about<br>this, SPANISH TESTAMENT, has remarkable passages, but apart from the<br>scrappiness that is usual in a book of reportage, it is definitely false<br>in places. In the prison scenes Koestler successfully establishes the<br>nightmare atmosphere which is, so to speak, his patent, but the rest of<br>the book is too much coloured by the Popular Front orthodoxy of the<br>time. One or two passages even look as though they had been doctored for<br>the purposes of the Left Book Club. At that time Koestler still was, or<br>recently had been, a member of the Communist Party, and the complex<br>politics of the civil war made it impossible for any Communist to write<br>honestly about the internal struggle on the Government side. The sin of<br>nearly all left-wingers from 1933 onwards is that they have wanted to be<br>anti-Fascist without being anti-totalitarian. In 1937 Koestler already<br>knew this, but did not feel free to say so. He came much nearer to<br>saying it--indeed, he did say it, though he put on a mask to do so--in<br>his next book, THE GLADIATORS, which was published about a year before<br>the war and for some reason attracted very little attention.<br><br>THE GLADIATORS is in some ways an unsatisfactory book. It is about<br>Spartacus, the Thracian gladiator who raised a slaves' rebellion in<br>Italy round about 65 BC, and any book on such a subject is handicapped<br>by challenging comparison with SALAMMBÔ. In our own age it would not be<br>possible to write a book like SALAMMBÔ even if one had the talent. The<br>great thing about Salammbô, even more important than its physical<br>detail, is its utter mercilessness. Flaubert could think himself into<br>the stony cruelty of antiquity, because in the mid-nineteenth century<br>one still had peace of mind. One had time to travel in the past.<br>Nowadays the present and the future are too terrifying to be escaped<br>from, and if one bothers with history it is in order to find modern<br>meanings there. Koestler makes Spartacus into an allegorical figure, a<br>primitive version of the proletarian dictator. Whereas Flaubert has been<br>able, by a prolonged effort of the imagination, to make his mercenaries<br>truly pre-Christian, Spartacus is a modern man dressed up. But this<br>might not matter if Koestler were fully aware of what his allegory<br>means. Revolutions always go wrong--that is the main theme. It is on the<br>question of WHY they go wrong that he falters, and his uncertainty<br>enters into the story and makes the central figures enigmatic and unreal.<br><br>For several years the rebellious slaves are uniformly successful. Their<br>numbers swell to a hundred thousand, they overrun great areas of<br>Southern Italy, they defeat one punitive expedition after another, they<br>ally themselves with the pirates who at that time were the masters of<br>the Mediterranean, and finally they set to work to build a city of their<br>own, to be named the City of the Sun. In this city human beings are to<br>be free and equal, and above all, they are to be happy: no slavery, no<br>hunger, no injustice, no floggings, no executions. It is the dream of a<br>just society which seems to haunt the human imagination ineradicably and<br>in all ages, whether it is called the Kingdom of Heaven or the classless<br>society, or whether it is thought of as a Golden Age which once existed<br>in the past and from which we have degenerated. Needless to say, the<br>slaves fail to achieve it. No sooner have they formed themselves into a<br>community than their way of life turns out to be as unjust, laborious<br>and fear-ridden as any other. Even the cross, symbol of slavery, has to<br>be revived for the punishment of malefactors. The turning-point comes<br>when Spartacus finds himself obliged to crucify twenty of his oldest and<br>most faithful followers. After that the City of the Sun is doomed, the<br>slaves split up and are defeated in detail, the last fifteen thousand of<br>them being captured and crucified in one batch.<br><br>The serious weakness of this story is that the motives of Spartacus<br>himself are never made clear. The Roman lawyer Fulvius, who joins the<br>rebellion and acts as its chronicler, sets forth the familiar dilemma of<br>ends and means. You can achieve nothing unless you are willing to use<br>force and cunning, but in using them you pervert your original aims.<br>Spartacus, however, is not represented as power hungry, nor, on the<br>other hand, as a visionary. He is driven onwards by some obscure force<br>which he does not understand, and he is frequently in two minds as to<br>whether it would not be better to throw up the whole adventure and flee<br>to Alexandria while the going is good. The slaves' republic is in any<br>case wrecked rather by hedonism than by the struggle for power. The<br>slaves are discontented with their liberty because they still have to<br>work, and the final break-up happens because the more turbulent and less<br>civilised slaves, chiefly Gauls and Germans, continue to behave like<br>bandits after the republic has been established. This may be a true<br>account of events--naturally we know very little about the slave<br>rebellions of antiquity--but by allowing the Sun City to be destroyed<br>because Crixus the Gaul cannot be prevented from looting and raping,<br>Koestler has faltered between allegory and history. If Spartacus is the<br>prototype of the modern revolutionary--and obviously he is intended as<br>that--he should have gone astray because of the impossibility of<br>combining power with righteousness. As it is, he is an almost passive<br>figure, acted upon rather than acting, and at times not convincing. The<br>story partly fails because the central problem of revolution has been<br>avoided or, at least, has not been solved.<br><br>It is again avoided in a subtler way in the next book, Koestler's<br>masterpiece, DARKNESS AT NOON. Here, however, the story is not spoiled,<br>because it deals with individuals and its interest is psychological. It<br>is an episode picked out from a background that does not have to be<br>questioned. DARKNESS AT NOON describes the imprisonment and death of an<br>Old Bolshevik, Rubashov, who first denies and ultimately confesses to<br>crimes which he is well aware he has not committed. The grown-upness,<br>the lack of surprise or denunciation, the pity and irony with which the<br>story is told, show the advantage, when one is handling a theme of this<br>kind, of being a European. The book reaches the stature of tragedy,<br>whereas an English or American writer could at most have made it into a<br>polemical tract. Koestler has digested his material and can treat it on<br>the aesthetic level. At the same time his handling of it has a political<br>implication, not important in this case but likely to be damaging in<br>later books.<br><br>Naturally the whole book centres round one question: Why did Rubashov<br>confess? He is not guilty--that is, not guilty of anything except the<br>essential crime of disliking the Stalin régime. The concrete acts of<br>treason in which he is supposed to have engaged are all imaginary. He<br>has not even been tortured, or not very severely. He is worn down by<br>solitude, toothache, lack of tobacco, bright lights glaring in his eyes,<br>and continuous questioning, but these in themselves would not be enough<br>to overcome a hardened revolutionary. The Nazis have previously done<br>worse to him without breaking his spirit. The confessions obtained in<br>the Russian state trials are capable of three explanations:<br><br>1. That the accused were guilty.<br><br>2. That they were tortured, and perhaps blackmailed by threats to<br>relatives and friends.<br><br>3. That they were actuated by despair, mental bankruptcy and the habit<br>of loyalty to the Party.<br><br>For Koestler's purpose in DARKNESS AT NOON 1 is ruled out, and though<br>this is not the place to discuss the Russian purges, I must add that<br>what little verifiable evidence there is suggests that the trials of the<br>Bolsheviks were frame-ups. If one assumes that the accused were not<br>guilty--at any rate, not guilty of the particular things they confessed<br>to--then 2 is the common-sense explanation. Koestler, however, plumps<br>for 3, which is also accepted by the Trotskyist Boris Souvarine, in his<br>pamphlet CAUCHEMAR EN URSS. Rubashov ultimately confesses because he<br>cannot find in his own mind any reason for not doing so. Justice and<br>objective truth have long ceased to have any meaning for him. For<br>decades he has been simply the creature of the Party, and what the Party<br>now demands is that he shall confess to non-existent crimes. In the end,<br>though he had to be bullied and weakened first, he is somewhat proud of<br>his decision to confess. He feels superior to the poor Czarist officer<br>who inhabits the next cell and who talks to Rubashov by tapping on the<br>wall. The Czarist officer is shocked when he learns that Rubashov<br>intends to capitulate. As he sees it from his "bourgeois" angle,<br>everyone ought to stick to his guns, even a Bolshevik. Honour, he says,<br>consists in doing what you think right. "Honour is to be useful without<br>fuss," Rubashov taps back; and he reflects with a certain satisfaction<br>that he is tapping with his pince-nez while the other, the relic of the<br>past, is tapping with a monocle. Like Bukharin, Rubashov is "looking out<br>upon black darkness". What is there, what code, what loyalty, what<br>notion of good and evil, for the sake of which he can defy the Party and<br>endure further torment? He is not only alone, he is also hollow. He has<br>himself committed worse crimes than the one that is now being<br>perpetrated against him. For example, as a secret envoy of the Party in<br>Nazi Germany, he has got rid of disobedient followers by betraying them to<br>the Gestapo. Curiously enough, if he has any inner strength to draw<br>upon, it is the memories of his boyhood when he was the son of<br>a landowner. The last thing he remembers, when he is shot from<br>behind, is the leaves of poplar trees on his father's estate. Rubashov<br>belongs to the older generation of Bolsheviks that was largely wiped out<br>in the purges. He is aware of art and literature, and of the world<br>outside Russia. He contrasts sharply with Gletkin, the young GPU man who<br>conducts his interrogation, and who is the typical "good party man",<br>completely without scruples or curiosity, a thinking gramophone.<br>Rubashov, unlike Gletkin, does not have the Revolution as his<br>starting-point. His mind was not a blank sheet when the Party got hold<br>of it. His superiority to the other is finally traceable to his<br>bourgeois origin.<br><br>One cannot, I think, argue that DARKNESS AT NOON is simply a story<br>dealing with the adventures of an imaginary individual. Clearly it is a<br>political book, founded on history and offering an interpretation of<br>disputed events. Rubashov might be called Trotsky, Bukharin Rakovsky or<br>some other relatively civilised figure among the Old Bolsheviks. If one<br>writes about the Moscow trials one must answer the question, "Why did<br>the accused confess?" and which answer one makes is a political<br>decision. Koestler answers, in effect, "Because these people had been<br>rotted by the Revolution which they served", and in doing so he comes<br>near to claiming that revolutions are of their nature bad. If one<br>assumes that the accused in the Moscow trials were made to confess by<br>means of some kind of terrorism, one is only saying that one particular<br>set of revolutionary leaders has gone astray. Individuals, and not the<br>situation, are to blame. The implication of Koestler's book, however, is<br>that Rubashov in power would be no better than Gletkin: or rather, only<br>better in that his outlook is still partly pre-revolutionary.<br>Revolution, Koestler seems to say, is a corrupting process. Really enter<br>into the Revolution and you must end up as either Rubashov or Gletkin.<br>It is not merely that "power corrupts": so also do the ways of attaining<br>power. Therefore, all efforts to regenerate society BY VIOLENT MEANS<br>lead to the cellars of the OGPU, Lenin leads to Stalin, and would have<br>come to resemble Stalin if he had happened to survive.<br><br>Of course, Koestler does not say this quite explicitly, and perhaps is<br>not altogether conscious of it. He is writing about darkness, but it is<br>darkness at what ought to be noon. Part of the time he feels that things<br>might have turned out differently. The notion that so-and-so has<br>"betrayed", that things have only gone wrong because of individual<br>wickedness, is ever present in left-wing thought. Later, in ARRIVAL AND<br>DEPARTURE, Koestler swings over much further towards the<br>anti-revolutionary position, but in between these two books there is<br>another, SCUM OF THE EARTH, which is straight autobiography and has only<br>an indirect bearing upon the problems raised by DARKNESS AT NOON. True<br>to his life-style, Koestler was caught in France by the outbreak of war<br>and, as a foreigner and a known anti-Fascist, was promptly arrested and<br>interned by the Daladier Government. He spent the first nine months of<br>war mostly in a prison camp, then, during the collapse of France,<br>escaped and travelled by devious routes to England, where he was once<br>again thrown into prison as an enemy alien. This time he was soon<br>released, however. The book is a valuable piece of reportage, and<br>together with a few other scraps of honest writing that happened to be<br>produced at the time of the débâcle, it is a reminder of the depths<br>that bourgeois democracy can descend to. At this moment, with France<br>newly liberated and the witch-hunt after collaborators in full swing, we<br>are apt to forget that in 1940 various observers on the spot considered<br>that about forty per cent of the French population was either actively<br>pro-German or completely apathetic. Truthful war books are never<br>acceptable to non-combatants, and Koestler's book did not have a very<br>good reception. Nobody came well out of it--neither the bourgeois<br>politicians, whose idea of conducting an anti-Fascist war was to jail<br>every left-winger they could lay their hands on, nor the French<br>Communists, who were effectively pro-Nazi and did their best to sabotage<br>the French war effort, nor the common people, who were just as likely to<br>follow mountebanks like Doriot as responsible leaders. Koestler records<br>some fantastic conversations with fellow victims in the concentration<br>camp, and adds that till then, like most middle-class Socialists and<br>Communists, he had never made contact with real proletarians, only with<br>the educated minority. He draws the pessimistic conclusion: "Without<br>education of the masses, no social progress; without social progress, no<br>education of the masses". In SCUM OF THE EARTH Koestler ceases to<br>idealise the common people. He has abandoned Stalinism, but he is not a<br>Trotskyist either. This is the book's real link with ARRIVAL AND<br>DEPARTURE, in which what is normally called a revolutionary outlook is<br>dropped, perhaps for good.<br><br>ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE is not a satisfactory book. The pretence that it<br>is a novel is very thin; in effect it is a tract purporting to show that<br>revolutionary creeds are rationalisations of neurotic impulses. With all<br>too neat a symmetry, the book begins and ends with the same action--a<br>leap into a foreign country. A young ex-Communist who has made his<br>escape from Hungary jumps ashore in Portugal, where he hopes to enter<br>the service of Britain, at that time the only power fighting against<br>Germany. His enthusiasm is somewhat cooled by the fact that the British<br>Consulate is uninterested in him and almost ignores him for a period of<br>several months, during which his money runs out and other astuter<br>refugees escape to America. He is successively tempted by the World in<br>the form of a Nazi propagandist, the Flesh in the form of a French girl,<br>and--after a nervous breakdown--the Devil in the form of a psychoanalyst.<br>The psychoanalyst drags out of him the fact that his revolutionary<br>enthusiasm is not founded on any real belief in historical necessity,<br>but on a morbid guilt complex arising from an attempt in early childhood<br>to blind his baby brother. By the time that he gets an opportunity of<br>serving the Allies he has lost all reason for wanting to do so, and he<br>is on the point of leaving for America when his irrational impulses<br>seize hold of him again. In practice he cannot abandon the struggle.<br>When the book ends, he is floating down in a parachute over the dark<br>landscape of his native country, where he will be employed as a secret<br>agent of Britain.<br><br>As a political statement (and the book is not much more), this is<br>insufficient. Of course it is true in many cases, and it may be true in<br>all cases, that revolutionary activity is the result of personal<br>maladjustment. Those who struggle against society are, on the whole,<br>those who have reason to dislike it, and normal healthy people are no<br>more attracted by violence and illegality than they are by war. The<br>young Nazi in ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE makes the penetrating remark that<br>one can see what is wrong with the left-wing movement by the ugliness of<br>its women. But after all, this does not invalidate the Socialist case.<br>Actions have results, irrespective of their motives. Marx's ultimate<br>motives may well have been envy and spite, but this does not prove that<br>his conclusions were false. In making the hero of ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE<br>take his final decision from a mere instinct not to shirk action and<br>danger, Koestler is making him suffer a sudden loss of intelligence.<br>With such a history as he has behind him, he would be able to see that<br>certain things have to be done, whether our reasons for doing them are<br>"good" or "bad". History has to move in a certain direction, even if it<br>has to be pushed that way by neurotics. In ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE Peter's<br>idols are overthrown one after the other. The Russian Revolution has<br>degenerated, Britain, symbolised by the aged consul with gouty fingers,<br>is no better, the international class-conscious proletariat is a myth.<br>But the conclusion (since, after all, Koestler and his hero "support"<br>the war) ought to be that getting rid of Hitler is still a worth-while<br>objective, a necessary bit of scavenging in which motives are almost<br>irrelevant.<br><br>To take a rational political decision one must have a picture of the<br>future. At present Koestler seems to have none, or rather to have two<br>which cancel out. As an ultimate objective he believes in the Earthly<br>Paradise, the Sun State which the gladiators set out to establish, and<br>which has haunted the imagination of Socialists, Anarchists and<br>religious heretics for hundreds of years. But his intelligence tells him<br>that the Earthly Paradise is receding into the far distance and that<br>what is actually ahead of us is bloodshed, tyranny and privation.<br>Recently he described himself as a "short-term pessimist". Every kind of<br>horror is blowing up over the horizon, but somehow it will all come<br>right in the end. This outlook is probably gaining ground among thinking<br>people: it results from the very great difficulty, once one has<br>abandoned orthodox religious belief, of accepting life on earth as<br>inherently miserable, and on the other hand, from the realisation that<br>to make life liveable is a much bigger problem than it recently seemed.<br>Since about 1930 the world has given no reason for optimism whatever.<br>Nothing is in sight except a welter of lies, hatred, cruelty and<br>ignorance, and beyond our present troubles loom vaster ones which are<br>only now entering into the European consciousness. It is quite possible<br>that man's major problems will NEVER be solved. But it is also<br>unthinkable! Who is there who dares to look at the world of today and<br>say to himself, "It will always be like this: even in a million years it<br>cannot get appreciably better?" So you get the quasi-mystical belief<br>that for the present there is no remedy, all political action is<br>useless, but that somewhere in space and time human life will cease to<br>be the miserable brutish thing it now is.<br><br>The only easy way out is that of the religious believer, who regards<br>this life merely as a preparation for the next. But few thinking people<br>now believe in life after death, and the number of those who do is<br>probably diminishing. The Christian churches would probably not survive<br>on their own merits if their economic basis were destroyed.<br><br>The real problem is how to restore the religious attitude while<br>accepting death as final. Men can only be happy when they do not assume<br>that the object of life is happiness. It is most unlikely, however, that<br>Koestler would accept this. There is a well-marked hedonistic strain in<br>his writings, and his failure to find a political position after<br>breaking with Stalinism is a result of this.<br><br>The Russian Revolution, the central event in Koestler's fife, started<br>out with high hopes. We forget these things now, but a quarter of a<br>century ago it was confidently expected that the Russian Revolution<br>would lead to Utopia. Obviously this has not happened. Koestler is too<br>acute not to see this, and too sensitive not to remember the original<br>objective. Moreover, from his European angle he can see such things as<br>purges and mass deportations for what they are; he is not, like Shaw or<br>Laski, looking at them through the wrong end of the telescope. Therefore<br>he draws the conclusion: This is what revolutions lead to. There is<br>nothing for it except to be a "short-term pessimist" i.e. to keep out of<br>politics, make a sort of oasis within which you and your friends can<br>remain sane, and hope that somehow things will be better in a hundred<br>years. At the basis of this lies his hedonism, which leads him to think<br>of the Earthly Paradise as desirable. Perhaps, however, whether<br>desirable or not, it isn't possible. Perhaps some degree of suffering is<br>ineradicable from human life, perhaps the choice before man is always a<br>choice of evils, perhaps even the aim of Socialism is not to make the<br>world perfect but to make it better. All revolutions are failures, but<br>they are not all the same failure. It is his unwillingness to admit this<br>that has led Koestler's mind temporarily into a blind alley and that<br>makes ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE seem shallow compared with the earlier books.<br><br></font></p>
