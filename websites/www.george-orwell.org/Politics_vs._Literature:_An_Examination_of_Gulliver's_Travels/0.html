<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">In GULLIVER'S TRAVELS humanity is attacked, or criticized, from at least<br>three different angles, and the implied character of Gulliver himself<br>necessarily changes somewhat in the process. In Part I he is the typical<br>eighteenth-century voyager, bold, practical and unromantic, his homely<br>outlook skilfully impressed on the reader by the biographical details at<br>the beginning, by his age (he is a man of forty, with two children, when<br>his adventures start), and by the inventory of the things in his pockets,<br>especially his spectacles, which make several appearances. In Part II he<br>has in general the same character, but at moments when the story demands<br>it he has a tendency to develop into an imbecile who is capable of<br>boasting of "our noble Country, the Mistress of Arts and Arms, the<br>Scourge of France", etc., etc., and at the same time of betraying every<br>available scandalous fact about the country which he professes to love.<br>In Part III he is much as he was in Part I, though, as he is consorting<br>chiefly with courtiers and men of learning, one has the impression that<br>he has risen in the social scale. In Part IV he conceives a horror of the<br>human race which is not apparent, or only intermittently apparent, in the<br>earlier books, and changes into a sort of unreligious anchorite whose one<br>desire is to live in some desolate spot where he can devote himself to<br>meditating on the goodness of the Houyhnhnms. However, these<br>inconsistencies are forced upon Swift by the fact that Gulliver is there<br>chiefly to provide a contrast. It is necessary, for instance, that he<br>should appear sensible in Part I and at least intermittently silly in<br>Part II because in both books the essential manoeuvre is the same, i.e.<br>to make the human being look ridiculous by imagining him as a creature<br>six inches high. Whenever Gulliver is not acting as a stooge there is a<br>sort of continuity in his character, which comes out especially in his<br>resourcefulness and his observation of physical detail. He is much the<br>same kind of person, with the same prose style, when he bears off the<br>warships of Blefuscu, when he rips open the belly of the monstrous rat,<br>and when he sails away upon the ocean in his frail coracle made from. the<br>skins of Yahoos. Moreover, it is difficult not to feel that in his<br>shrewder moments Gulliver is simply Swift himself, and there is at least<br>one incident in which Swift seems to be venting his private grievance<br>against contemporary Society. It will be remembered that when the Emperor<br>of Lilliput's palace catches fire, Gulliver puts it out by urinating on<br>it. Instead of being congratulated on his presence of mind, he finds that<br>he has committed a capital offence by making water in the precincts of<br>the palace, and<br><br><br>I was privately assured, that the Empress, conceiving the greatest<br>Abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the most distant Side of the<br>Court, firmly resolved that those buildings should never be repaired for<br>her Use; and, in the Presence of her chief Confidents, could not forbear<br>vowing Revenge.<br><br><br>According to Professor G. M. Trevelyan (ENGLAND UNDER QUEEN ANNE), part<br>of the reason for Swift's failure to get preferment was that the Queen<br>was scandalized by A TALE OF A TUB--a pamphlet in which Swift probably<br>felt that he had done a great service to the English Crown, since it<br>scarifies the Dissenters and still more the Catholics while leaving the<br>Established Church alone. In any case no one would deny that GULLIVER'S<br>TRAVELS is a rancorous as well as a pessimistic book, and that especially<br>in Parts I and III it often descends into political partisanship of a<br>narrow kind. Pettiness and magnanimity, republicanism and<br>authori-tarianism, love of reason and lack of curiosity, are all mixed up<br>in it. The hatred of the human body with which Swift is especially<br>associated is only dominant in Part IV, but somehow this new<br>preoccupation does not come as a surprise. One feels that all these<br>adventures, and all these changes of mood, could have happened to the<br>same person, and the inter-connexion between Swift's political loyalties<br>and his ultimate despair is one of the most interesting features of the<br>book.<br><br>Politically, Swift was one of those people who are driven into a sort of<br>perverse Toryism by the follies of the progressive party of the moment.<br>Part I of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, ostensibly a satire on human greatness, can<br>be seen, if one looks a little deeper, to be simply an attack on England,<br>on the dominant Whig Party, and on the war with France, which--however<br>bad the motives of the Allies may have been--did save Europe from being<br>tyrannized over by a single reactionary power. Swift was not a Jacobite<br>nor strictly speaking a Tory, and his declared aim in the war was merely<br>a moderate peace treaty and not the outright defeat of England.<br>Nevertheless there is a tinge of quis-lingism in his attitude, which<br>comes out in the ending of Part I and slightly interferes with the<br>allegory. When Gulliver flees from Lilliput (England) to Blefuscu<br>(France) the assumption that a human being six inches high is inherently<br>contemptible seems to be dropped. Whereas the people of Lilliput have<br>behaved towards Gulliver with the utmost treachery and meanness, those of<br>Blefuscu behave generously and straightforwardly, and indeed this section<br>of the book ends on a different note from the all-round disillusionment<br>of the earlier chapters. Evidently Swift's animus is, in the first place,<br>against ENGLAND. It is "your Natives" (i.e. Gulliver's fellow-countrymen)<br>whom the King of Brob-dingnag considers to be "the most pernicious Race<br>of little odious vermin that Nature ever suffered to crawl upon the<br>surface of the Earth", and the long passage at the end, denouncing<br>colonization and foreign conquest, is plainly aimed at England, although<br>the contrary is elaborately stated. The Dutch, England's allies and<br>target of one of Swift's most famous pamphlets, are also more or less<br>wantonly attacked in Part III. There is even what sounds like a personal<br>note in the passage in which Gulliver records his satisfaction that the<br>various countries he has discovered cannot be made colonies of the<br>British Crown:<br><br><br>The HOUYHNHNMS, indeed, appear not to be so well prepared for War, a<br>Science to which they are perfect Strangers, and especially against<br>missive Weapons. However, supposing myself to be a Minister of State, I<br>could never give my advice for invading them. . . . Imagine twenty thousand<br>of them breaking into the midst of an EUROPEAN army, confounding the<br>Ranks, overturning the Carriages, battering the Warriors' Faces into<br>Mummy, by terrible Yerks from their hinder hoofs. . .<br><br><br>Considering that Swift does not waste words, that phrase, "battering the<br>warriors' faces into mummy", probably indicates a secret wish to see the<br>invincible armies of the Duke of Marlborough treated in a like manner.<br>There are similar touches elsewhere. Even the country mentioned in Part<br>III, where "the Bulk of the People consist, in a Manner, wholly of<br>Discoverers, Witnesses, Informers, Accusers, Prosecutors, Evidences,<br>Swearers, together with their several subservient and subaltern<br>Instruments, all under the Colours, the Conduct, and Pay of Ministers of<br>State", is called Langdon, which is within one letter of being an anagram<br>of England. (As the early editions of the book contain misprints, it may<br>perhaps have been intended as a complete anagram.) Swift's PHYSICAL<br>repulsion from humanity is certainly real enough, but one has the feeling<br>that his debunking of human grandeur, his diatribes against lords,<br>politicians, court favourites, etc., has mainly a local application and<br>springs from the fact that he belonged to the unsuccessful party. He<br>denounces injustice and oppression, but he gives no evidence of liking<br>democracy. In spite of his enormously greater powers, his implied<br>position is very similar to that of the innumerable silly-clever<br>Conservatives of our own day--people like Sir Alan Herbert, Professor G.<br>M. Young, Lord Eiton, the Tory Reform Committee or the long line of<br>Catholic apologists from W. H. Mallock onwards: people who specialize in<br>cracking neat jokes at the expense of whatever is "modern" and<br>"progressive", and whose opinions are often all the more extreme because<br>they know that they cannot influence the actual drift of events. After<br>all, such a pamphlet as AN ARGUMENT TO PROVE THAT THE ABOLISHING OF<br>CHRISTIANITY, etc., is very like "Timothy Shy" having a bit of clean fun<br>with the Brains Trust, or Father Ronald Knox exposing the errors<br>of Bertrand Russell. And the ease with which Swift has been forgiven--and<br>forgiven, sometimes, by devout believers--for the blasphemies of A TALE<br>OF A TUB demonstrates clearly enough the feebleness of religious<br>sentiments as compared with political ones.<br><br>However, the reactionary cast of Swift's mind does not show itself<br>chiefly in his political affiliations. The important thing is his<br>attitude towards Science, and, more broadly, towards intellectual<br>curiosity. The famous Academy of Lagado, described in Part III of<br>GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, is no doubt a justified satire on most of the<br>so-called scientists of Swift's own day. Significantly, the people at<br>work in it are described as "Projectors", that is, people not engaged in<br>disinterested research but merely on the look-out for gadgets which will<br>save labour and bring in money. But there is no sign--indeed, all<br>through the book there are many signs to the contrary--that "pure"<br>science would have struck Swift as a worth-while activity. The more<br>serious kind of scientist has already had a kick in the pants in Part II,<br>when the "Scholars" patronized by the King of Brobdingnag try to account<br>for Gulliver's small stature:<br><br><br>After much Debate, they concluded unanimously that I was only RELPLUM<br>SCALCATH, which is interpreted literally, LUSUS NATURAE, a Determination<br>exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy of EUROPE, whose Professors,<br>disdaining the old Evasion of OCCULT CAUSES, whereby the followers of<br>ARISTOTLE endeavoured in vain to disguise their Ignorance, have invented<br>this wonderful solution of All Difficulties, to the unspeakable<br>Advancement of human Knowledge.<br><br><br>If this stood by itself one might assume that Swift is merely the enemy<br>of SHAM science. In a number of places, however, he goes out of his way<br>to proclaim the uselessness of all learning or speculation not directed<br>towards some practical end:<br><br><br>The learning of (the Brobdingnaglans) is very defective, consisting only<br>in Morality, History, Poetry, and Mathematics, wherein they must be<br>allowed to excel. But, the last of these is wholly applied to what may be<br>useful in Life, to the improvement of Agriculture, and all mechanical<br>Arts so that among us it would be little esteemed. And as to Ideas,<br>Entities, Abstractions, and Transcen-dentals, I could never drive the<br>least Conception into their Heads.<br><br><br>The Houyhnhnms, Swift's ideal beings, are backward even in a mechanical<br>sense. They are unacquainted with metals, have never heard of boats, do<br>not, properly speaking, practise agriculture (we are told that the oats<br>which they live upon "grow naturally"), and appear not to have invented<br>wheels. [Note, below] They have no alphabet, and evidently have not much<br>curiosity about the physical world. They do not believe that any inhabited<br>country exists beside their own, and though they understand the motions of<br>the sun and moon, and the nature of eclipses, "this is the utmost progress<br>of their ASTRONOMY". By contrast, the philosophers of the flying island of<br>Laputa are so continuously absorbed in mathematical speculations that before<br>speaking to them one has to attract their attention by napping them on the<br>ear with a bladder. They have catalogued ten thousand fixed stars, have<br>settled the periods of ninety-three comets, and have discovered,<br>in advance of the astronomers of Europe, that Mars has two<br>moons--all of which information Swift evidently regards as ridiculous,<br>useless and uninteresting. As one might expect, he believes that the<br>scientist's place, if he has a place, is in the laboratory, and that<br>scientific knowledge has no bearing on political matters:<br><br><br>[Note: Houyhnhnms too old to walk are described as being carried on<br>"sledges" or in "a kind of vehicle, drawn like a sledge". Presumably these<br>had no wheels. (Author's note.)]<br><br><br>What I . . . thought altogether unaccountable, was the strong Disposition<br>I observed in them towards News and Politics, perpetually enquiring into<br>Public Affairs, giving their judgements in Matters of State, and<br>passionately disputing every inch of a Party Opinion. I have, indeed,<br>observed the same Disposition among most of the Mathematicians I have<br>known in EUROPE, though I could never discover the least Analogy between<br>the two Sciences; unless those people suppose, that, because the smallest<br>Circle hath as many Degrees as the largest, therefore the Regulation and<br>Management of the World require no more Abilities, than the Handling and<br>Turning of a Globe.<br><br><br>Is there not something familiar in that phrase "I could never discover<br>the least analogy between the two sciences"? It has precisely the note of<br>the popular Catholic apologists who profess to be astonished when a<br>scientist utters an opinion on such questions as the existence of God or<br>the immortality of the soul. The scientist, we are told, is an expert<br>only in one restricted field: why should his opinions be of value in any<br>other? The implication is that theology is just as much an exact science<br>as, for instance, chemistry, and that the priest is also an expert whose<br>conclusions on certain subjects must be accepted. Swift in effect makes<br>the same claim for the politician, but he goes one better in that he will<br>not allow the scientist--either the "pure" scientist or the ad hoc<br>investigator--to be a useful person in his own line. Even if he had not<br>written Part III of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, one could infer from the rest of<br>the book that, like Tolstoy and like Blake, he hates the very idea of<br>studying the processes of Nature. The "Reason" which he so admires in the<br>Houyhnhnms does not primarily mean the power of drawing logical<br>inferences from observed facts. Although he never defines it, it appears<br>in most contexts to mean either common sense--i.e. acceptance of the<br>obvious and contempt for quibbles and abstractions--or absence of<br>passion and superstition. In general he assumes that we know all that we<br>need to know already, and merely use our knowledge incorrectly. Medicine,<br>for instance, is a useless science, because if we lived in a more natural<br>way, there would be no diseases. Swift, however, is not a simple-lifer or<br>an admirer of the Noble Savage. He is in favour of civilization and the<br>arts of civilization. Not only does he see the value of good manners,<br>good conversation, and even learning of a literary and historical kind,<br>he also sees that agriculture, navigation and architecture need to be<br>studied and could with advantages be improved. But his implied aim is a<br>static, incurious civilization--the world of his own day, a little<br>cleaner, a little saner, with no radical change and no poking into the<br>unknowable. More than one would expect in anyone so free from accepted<br>fallacies, he reveres the past, especially classical antiquity, and<br>believes that modern man has degenerated sharply during the past hundred<br>years. [Note, below] In the island of sorcerers, where the spirits of the<br>dead can be called up at will:<br><br><br>[Note: The physical decadence which Swift claims to have observed may have<br>been a reality at that date. He attributes it to syphilis, which was a new<br>disease in Europe and may have been more virulent than it is now. Distilled<br>liquors, also, were a novelty in the seventeenth century and must have led<br>at first to a great increase in drunkenness. (Author's footnote.)]<br><br><br>I desired that the Senate of ROME might appear before me in one large<br>chamber, and a modern Representative in Counterview, in another. The<br>first seemed to be an Assembly of Heroes and Demy-Gods, the other a Knot<br>of Pedlars, Pick-pockets, Highwaymen and Bullies.<br><br><br>Although Swift uses this section of Part III to attack the truthfulness<br>of recorded history, his critical spirit deserts him as soon as he is<br>dealing with Greeks and Romans. He remarks, of course, upon the<br>corruption of imperial Rome, but he has an almost unreasoning admiration<br>for some of the leading figures of the ancient world:<br><br><br>I was struck with profound Veneration at the sight of BRUTUS, and could<br>easily discover the most consummate Virtue, the greatest Intrepidity and<br>Firmness of Mind, the truest Love of his Country, and general Benevolence<br>for Mankind, in every Lineament of his Countenance. . . . I had the honour<br>to have much Conversation with BRUTUS, and was told, that his Ancestors<br>JUNIUS, SOCRATES, EPAMINONDAS, CATO the younger, SIR THOMAS MORE, and<br>himself, were perpetually together: a SEXTUMVIRATE, to which all the Ages<br>of the World cannot add a seventh.<br><br><br>It will be noticed that of these six people, only one is a Christian.<br>This is an important point. If one adds together Swift's pessimism, his<br>reverence for the past, his incuriosity and his horror of the human body,<br>one arrives at an attitude common among religious reactionaries--that<br>is, people who defend an unjust order of Society by claiming that this<br>world cannot be substantially improved and only the "next world" matters.<br>However, Swift shows no sign of having any religious beliefs, at least in<br>any ordinary sense of the words. He does not appear to believe seriously<br>in life after death, and his idea of goodness is bound up with<br>republicanism, love of liberty, courage, "benevolence" (meaning in effect<br>public spirit), "reason" and other pagan qualities. This reminds one that<br>there is another strain in Swift, not quite congruous with his disbelief<br>in progress and his general hatred of humanity.<br><br>To begin with, he has moments when he is "constructive" and even<br>"advanced". To be occasionally inconsistent is almost a mark of vitality<br>in Utopia books, and Swift sometimes inserts a word of praise into a<br>passage that ought to be purely satirical. Thus, his ideas about the<br>education of the young are fathered on to the Lilliputians, who have much<br>the same views on this subject as the Houyhnhnms. The Lilliputians also<br>have various social and legal institutions (for instance, there are old<br>age pensions, and people are rewarded for keeping the law as well as<br>punished for breaking it) which Swift would have liked to see prevailing<br>in his own country. In the middle of this passage Swift remembers his<br>satirical intention and adds, "In relating these and the following Laws,<br>I would only be understood to mean the original Institutions, and not the<br>most scandalous Corruptions into which these people are fallen by the<br>degenerate Nature of Man" but as Lilliput is supposed to represent<br>England, and the laws he is speaking of have never had their parallel in<br>England, it is clear that the impulse to make constructive suggestions<br>has been too much for him. But Swift's greatest contribution to political<br>thought in the narrower sense of the words, is his attack, especially in<br>Part III, on what would now be called totalitarianism. He has an<br>extraordinarily clear prevision of the spy-haunted "police State", with<br>its endless heresy-hunts and treason trials, all really designed to<br>neutralize popular discontent by changing it into war hysteria. And one<br>must remember that Swift is here inferring the whole from a quite small<br>part, for the feeble governments of his own day did not give him<br>illustrations ready-made. For example, there is the professor at the<br>School of Political Projectors who "shewed me a large Paper of<br>Instructions for discovering Plots and Conspiracies", and who claimed<br>that one can find people's secret thoughts by examining their excrement:<br><br><br>Because Men are never so serious, thoughtful, and intent, as when they<br>are at Stool, which he found by frequent Experiment: for in such<br>Conjunctures, when he used meerly as a trial to consider what was the<br>best Way of murdering the King, his Ordure would have a tincture of<br>Green; but quite different when he thought only of raising an<br>Insurrection, or burning the Metropolis.<br><br><br>The professor and his theory are said to have been suggested to Swift by<br>the--from our point of view--not particularly astonishing or disgusting<br>fact that in a recent State trial some letters found in somebody's privy<br>had been put in evidence. Later in the same chapter we seem to be<br>positively in the middle of the Russian purges:<br><br><br>In the Kingdom of Tribnia, by the Natives called Langdon. . . the Bulk of<br>the People consist, in a Manner, wholly of Discoverers, Witnesses,<br>Informers, Accusers, Prosecutors, Evidences, Swearers. . . It is first agreed,<br>and settled among them, what suspected Persons shall be accused of a<br>Plot: Then, effectual Care is taken to secure all their Letters and<br>Papers, and put the Owners in Chains. These papers are delivered<br>to a Sett of Artists, very dexterous in finding out the<br>mysterious Meanings of Words, Syllables, and Letters. . . . Where this<br>method fails, they have two others more effectual, which the Learned<br>among them call ACROSTICS and ANAGRAMS. FIRST, they can decypher all<br>initial Letters into political Meanings: Thus: N shall signify a Plot, B<br>a Regiment of Horse, L a Fleet at Sea: Or, SECONDLY, by transposing the<br>Letters of the Alphabet in any suspected Paper, they can lay open the<br>deepest Designs of a discontented Party. So, for Example if I should say<br>in a Letter to a Friend, OUR BROTHER TOM HAS JUST GOT THE PILES, a<br>skilful Decypherer would discover that the same Letters, which compose<br>that Sentence, may be analysed in the following Words: RESIST--A PLOT IS<br>BROUGHT HOME--THE TOUR (Note: tower). And this is the anagrammatic method.<br><br><br>Other professors at the same school invent simplified languages, write<br>books by machinery, educate their pupils by inscribing the lesson on a<br>wafer and causing them to swallow it, or propose to abolish individuality<br>altogether by cutting off part of the brain of one man and grafting it on<br>to the head of another. There is something queerly familiar in the<br>atmosphere of these chapters, because, mixed up with much fooling, there<br>is a perception that one of the aims of totalitarianism is not merely to<br>make sure that people will think the right thoughts, but actually to make<br>them LESS CONSCIOUS. Then, again, Swift's account of the Leader who is<br>usually to be found ruling over a tribe of Yahoos, and of the "favourite"<br>who acts first as a dirty-worker and later as a scapegoat, fits<br>remarkably well into the pattern of our own times. But are we to infer<br>from all this that Swift was first and foremost an enemy of tyranny and a<br>champion of the free intelligence? No: his own views, so far as one can<br>discern them, are not markedly liberal. No doubt he hates lords, kings,<br>bishops, generals, ladies of fashion, orders, titles and flummery<br>generally, but he does not seem to o think better of the common people<br>than of their rulers, or to be in favour of increased social equality, or<br>to be enthusiastic about representative institutions. The Houyhnhnms are<br>organized upon a sort of caste system which is racial in character, the<br>horses which do the menial work being of different colours from their<br>masters and not interbreeding with them. The educational system which<br>Swift admires in the Lilliputians takes hereditary class distinctions for<br>granted, and the children of the poorest classes do not go to school,<br>because "their Business being only to till and cultivate the Earth. . .<br>therefore their Education is of little Consequence to the Public". Nor<br>does he seem to have been strongly in favour of freedom of speech and the<br>Press, in spite of the toleration which his own writings enjoyed. The<br>King of Brobdingnag is astonished at the multiplicity of religious and<br>political sects in England, and considers that those who hold "opinions<br>prejudicial to the public" (in the context this seems to mean simply<br>heretical opinions), though they need not be obliged to change them,<br>ought to be obliged to conceal them: for "as it was Tyranny in any<br>Government to require the first, so it was weakness not to enforce the<br>second". There is a subtler indication of Swift's own attitude in the<br>manner in which Gulliver leaves the land of the Houyhnhnms.<br>Intermittently, at least. Swift was a kind of anarchist, and Part IV of<br>GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a picture of an anarchistic Society, not governed<br>by law in the ordinary sense, but by the dictates of "Reason", which arc<br>voluntarily accepted by everyone. The General Assembly of the Houyhnhnms<br>"exhorts" Gulliver's master to get rid of him, and his neighbours put<br>pressure on him to make him comply. Two reasons are given. One is that<br>the presence of this unusual Yahoo may unsettle the rest of the tribe,<br>and the other is that a friendly relationship between a Houyhnhnm and a<br>Yahoo is "not agreeable to Reason or Nature, or a Thing ever heard of<br>before among them". Gulliver's master is somewhat unwilling to obey, but<br>the "exhortation" (a Houyhnhnm, we are told, is never COMPELLED to do<br>anything, he is merely "exhorted" or "advised") cannot be disregarded.<br>This illustrates very well the totalitarian tendency which is explicit in<br>the anarchist or pacifist vision of Society. In a Society in which there<br>is no law, and in theory no compulsion, the only arbiter of behaviour is<br>public opinion. But public opinion, because of the tremendous urge to<br>conformity in gregarious animals, is less tolerant than any system of<br>law. When human beings are governed by "thou shalt not", the individual<br>can practise a certain amount of eccentricity: when they are supposedly<br>governed by "love" or "reason", he is under continuous pressure to make<br>him behave and think in exactly the same way as everyone else. The<br>Houyhnhnms, we are told, were unanimous on almost all subjects. The only<br>question they ever DISCUSSED was how to deal with the Yahoos. Otherwise<br>there was no room for disagreement among them, because the truth is<br>always either self-evident, or else it is undis-coverable and<br>unimportant. They had apparently no word for "opinion" in their language,<br>and in their conversations there was no "difference of sentiments". They<br>had reached, in fact, the highest stage of totalitarian organization, the<br>stage when conformity has become so general that there is no need for a<br>police force. Swift approves of this kind of thing because among his many<br>gifts neither curiosity nor good-nature was included. Disagreement would<br>always seem to him sheer perversity. "Reason," among the Houyhnhnms, he<br>says, "is not a Point Problematical, as with us, where men can argue with<br>Plausibility on both Sides of a Question; but strikes you with immediate<br>Conviction; as it must needs do, where it is not mingled, obscured, or<br>discoloured by Passion and Interest." In other words, we know everything<br>already, so why should dissident opinions be tolerated? The totalitarian<br>Society of the Houyhnhnms, where there can be no freedom and no<br>development, follows naturally from this.<br><br>We are right to think of Swift as a rebel and iconoclast, but except in<br>certain secondary matters, such as his insistence that women should<br>receive the same education as men, he cannot be labelled "Left". He is a<br>Tory anarchist, despising authority while disbelieving in liberty, and<br>preserving the aristocratic outlook while seeing clearly that the<br>existing aristocracy is degenerate and contemptible. When Swift utters<br>one of his characteristic diatribes against the rich and powerful, one<br>must probably, as I said earlier, write off something for the fact that<br>he himself belonged to the less successful party, and was personally<br>disappointed. The "outs", for obvious reasons, are always more radical<br>than the "ins". [Note, below] But the most essential thing in Swift is his<br>inability to believe that life--ordinary life on the solid earth, and not<br>some rationalized, deodorized version of it--could be made worth living. Of<br>course, no honest person claims that happiness is NOW a normal condition<br>among adult human beings; but perhaps it COULD be made normal, and it is<br>upon this question that all serious political controversy really turns.<br>Swift has much in common--more, I believe, than has been noticed--with<br>Tolstoy, another disbeliever in the possibility of happiness. In both men<br>you have the same anarchistic outlook covering an authoritarian cast of<br>mind; in both a similar hostility to Science, the same impatience with<br>opponents, the same inability to see the importance of any question not<br>interesting to themselves; and in both cases a sort of horror of the<br>actual process of life, though in Tolstoy's case it was arrived at later<br>and in a different way. The sexual unhappiness of the two men was not of<br>the same kind, but there was this in common, that in both of them a<br>sincere loathing was mixed up with a morbid fascination. Tolstoy was a<br>reformed rake who ended by preaching complete celibacy, while continuing<br>to practise the opposite into extreme old age. Swift was presumably<br>impotent, and had an exaggerated horror of human dung: he also thought<br>about it incessantly, as is evident throughout his works. Such people are<br>not likely to enjoy even the small amount of happiness that falls to most<br>human beings, and, from obvious motives, are not likely to admit that<br>earthly life is capable of much improvement. Their incuriosity, and hence<br>their intolerance, spring from the same root.<br><br><br>[Note: At the end of the book, as typical specimens of human<br>folly and viciousness, Swift names "a Lawyer, a Pickpocket,<br>a Colonel, a Fool, a Lord, a Gamester, a Politician, a Whore-master,<br>a Physician, an Evidence, a Suborner, an Attorney, a Traitor, or the<br>like". One sees here the irresponsible violence of the powerless.<br>The list lumps together those who break the conventional code, and those<br>who keep it. For instance, if you automatically condemn a colonel, as<br>such, on what grounds do you condemn a traitor? Or again, if you want to<br>suppress pickpockets, you must have laws, which means that you must have<br>lawyers. But the whole closing passage, in which the hatred is so<br>authentic, and the reason given for it so inadequate, is somehow<br>unconvincing. One has the feeling that personal animosity is at work.<br>(Author's footnote.)]<br><br><br>Swift's disgust, rancour and pessimism would make sense against the<br>background of a "next world" to which this one is the prelude. As he does<br>not appear to believe seriously in any such thing, it becomes necessary<br>to construct a paradise supposedly existing on the surface of the earth,<br>but something quite different from anything we know, with all that he<br>disapproves of--lies, folly, change, enthusiasm, pleasure, love and dirt<br>--eliminated from it. As his ideal being he chooses the horse, an animal<br>whose excrement is not offensive. The Houyhnhnms are dreary beasts--this<br>is so generally admitted that the point is not worth labouring. Swift's<br>genius can make them credible, but there can have been very few readers<br>in whom they have excited any feeling beyond dislike. And this is not<br>from wounded vanity at seeing animals preferred to men; for, of the two,<br>the Houyhnhnms are much liker to human beings than are the Yahoos, and<br>Gulliver's horror of the Yahoos, together with his recognition that they<br>are the same kind of creature as himself, contains a logical absurdity.<br>This horror comes upon him at his very first sight of them. "I never<br>beheld," he says, "in all my Travels, so disagreeable an Animal, nor one<br>against which I naturally conceived so strong an Antipathy." But in<br>comparison with what are the Yahoos disgusting? Not with the Houyhnhnms,<br>because at this time Gulliver has not seen a Houyhnhnm. It can only be in<br>comparison with himself, i.e. with a human being. Later, however, we are<br>to be told that the Yahoos ARE human beings, and human society becomes<br>insupportable to Gulliver because all men are Yahoos. In that case why<br>did he not conceive his disgust of humanity earlier? In effect we are<br>told that the Yahoos are fantastically different from men, and yet are<br>the same. Swift has over-reached himself in his fury, and is shouting at<br>his fellow-creatures, "You are filthier than you are!" However, it is<br>impossible to feel much sympathy with the Yahoos, and it is not because<br>they oppress the Yahoos that the Houyhnhnms are unattractive. They are<br>unattractive because the "Reason" by which they are governed is really a<br>desire for death. They are exempt from love, friendship, curiosity, fear,<br>sorrow and--except in their feelings towards the Yahoos, who occupy<br>rather the same place in their community as the Jews in Nazi Germany--<br>anger and hatred. "They have no Fondness for their Colts or Foles, but<br>the Care they take, in educating them, proceeds entirely from the<br>Dictates of REASON." They lay store by "Friendship" and "Benevolence",<br>but "these are not confined to particular Objects, but universal to the<br>whole Race". They also value conversation, but in their conversations<br>there are no differences of opinion, and "nothing passed but what was<br>useful, expressed in the fewest and most significant Words". They<br>practise strict birth control, each couple producing two offspring and<br>thereafter abstaining from sexual intercourse. Their marriages are<br>arranged for them by their elders, on eugenic principles, and their<br>language contains no word for "love", in the sexual sense. When somebody<br>dies they carry on exactly as before, without feeling any grief. It will<br>be seen that their aim is to be as like a corpse as is possible while<br>retaining physical life. One or two of their characteristics, it is true,<br>do not seem to be strictly "reasonable" in their own usage of the word.<br>Thus, they place a great value not only on physical hardihood but on<br>athleticism, and they are devoted to poetry. But these exceptions may be<br>less arbitrary than they seem. Swift probably emphasizes the physical<br>strength of the Houyhnhnms in order to make clear that they could never<br>be conquered by the hated human race, while a taste for poetry may figure<br>among their qualities because poetry appeared to Swift as the antithesis<br>of Science, from his point of view the most useless of all pursuits. In<br>Part III he names "Imagination, Fancy, and Invention" as desirable<br>faculties in which the Laputan mathematicians (in spite of their love of<br>music) were wholly lacking. One must remember that although Swift was an<br>admirable writer of comic verse, the kind of poetry he thought valuable<br>would probably be didactic poetry. The poetry of the Houyhnhnms,<br>he says<br><br><br>must be allowed to excel (that of) all other Mortals; wherein the<br>Justness of their Similes, and the Minuteness, as well as exactness, of<br>their Descriptions, are, indeed, inimitable. Their Verses abound very<br>much in both of these; and usually contain either some exalted Notions of<br>Friendship and Benevolence, or the Praises of those who were Victors in<br>Races, and other bodily Exercises.<br><br><br>Alas, not even the genius of Swift was equal to producing a specimen by<br>which we could judge the poetry of the Houyhnhnms. But it sounds as<br>though it were chilly stuff (in heroic couplets, presumably), and not<br>seriously in conflict with the principles of "Reason".<br><br>Happiness is notoriously difficult to describe, and pictures of a just<br>and well-ordered Society are seldom either attractive or convincing. Most<br>creators of "favourable" Utopias, however, are concerned to show what<br>life could be like if it were lived more fully. Swift advocates a simple<br>refusal of life, justifying this by the claim that "Reason" consists in<br>thwarting your instincts. The Houyhnhnms, creatures without a history,<br>continue for generation after generation to live prudently, maintaining<br>their population at exactly the same level, avoiding all passion,<br>suffering from no diseases, meeting death indifferently, training up<br>their young in the same principles--and all for what? In order that the<br>same process may continue indefinitely. The notions that life here and<br>now is worth living, or that it could be made worth living, or that it<br>must be sacrificed for some future good, are all absent. The dreary world<br>of the Houyhnhnms was about as good a Utopia as Swift could construct,<br>granting that he neither believed in a "next world" nor could get any<br>pleasure out of certain normal activities. But it is not really set up as<br>something desirable in itself, but as the justification for another<br>attack on humanity. The aim, as usual, is to humiliate Man by reminding<br>him that he is weak and ridiculous, and above all that he stinks; and the<br>ultimate motive, probably, is a kind of envy, the envy of the ghost for<br>the living, of the man who knows he cannot be happy for the others who--<br>so he fears--may be a little happier than himself. The political<br>expression of such an outlook must be either reactionary or nihilistic,<br>because the person who holds it will want to prevent Society from<br>developing in some direction in which his pessimism may be cheated. One<br>can do this either by blowing everything to pieces, or by averting social<br>change. Swift ultimately blew everything to pieces in the only way that<br>was feasible before the atomic bomb--that is, he went mad--but, as I<br>have tried to show, his political aims were on the whole reactionary ones.<br><br>From what I have written it may have seemed that I am AGAINST Swift, and<br>that my object is to refute him and even to belittle him. In a political<br>and moral sense I am against him, so far as I understand him. Yet<br>curiously enough he is one of the writers I admire with least reserve,<br>and GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, in particular, is a book which it seems<br>impossible for me to grow tired of. I read it first when I was, eight--<br>one day short of eight, to be exact, for I stole and furtively read the<br>copy which was to be given me next day on my eighth birthday--and I have<br>certainly not read it less than half a dozen times since. Its fascination<br>seems inexhaustible. If I had to make a list of six books which were to<br>be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would certainly put<br>GULLIVER'S TRAVELS among them. This raises the question: what is the<br>relationship between agreement with a writer's opinions, and enjoyment of<br>his work?<br><br>If one is capable of intellectual detachment, one can PERCEIVE merit in a<br>writer whom one deeply disagrees with, but ENJOYMENT is a different<br>matter. Supposing that there is such a thing as good or bad art, then the<br>goodness or badness must reside in the work of art itself--not<br>independently of the observer, indeed, but independently of the mood of<br>the observer. In one sense, therefore, it cannot be true that a poem is<br>good on Monday and bad on Tuesday. But if one judges the poem by the<br>appreciation it arouses, then it can certainly be true, because<br>appreciation, or enjoyment, is a subjective condition which cannot be<br>commanded. For a great deal of his waking life, even the most cultivated<br>person has no aesthetic feelings whatever, and the power to have<br>aesthetic feelings is very easily destroyed. When you are frightened, or<br>hungry, or are suffering from toothache or sea-sickness, KING LEAR is no<br>better from your point of view than PETER PAN. You may know in an<br>intellectual sense that it is better, but that is simply a fact which you<br>remember: you will not FEEL the merit of KING LEAR until you are normal<br>again. And aesthetic judgement can be upset just as disastrously--more<br>disastrously, because the cause is less readily recognized--by political<br>or moral disagreement. If a book angers, wounds or alarms you, then you<br>will not enjoy it, whatever its merits may be. If it seems to you a<br>really pernicious book, likely to influence other people in some<br>undesirable way, then you will probably construct an aesthetic theory to<br>show that it HAS no merits. Current literary criticism consists quite<br>largely of this kind of dodging to and fro between two sets of standards.<br>And yet the opposite process can also happen: enjoyment can overwhelm<br>disapproval, even though one clearly recognizes that one is enjoying<br>something inimical. Swift, whose world-view is so peculiarly<br>unacceptable, but who is nevertheless an extremely popular writer, is a<br>good instance of this. Why is it that we don't mind being called Yahoos,<br>although firmly convinced that we are NOT Yahoos?<br><br>It is not enough to make the usual answer that of course Swift was wrong,<br>in fact he was insane, but he was "a good writer". It is true that the<br>literary quality of a book is to some small extent separable from its<br>subject-matter. Some people have a native gift for using words, as some<br>people have a naturally "good eye" at games. It is largely a question of<br>timing and of instinctively knowing how much emphasis to use. As an<br>example near at hand, look back at the passage I quoted earlier, starting<br>"In the Kingdom of Tribnia, by the Natives called Langdon". It derives<br>much of its force from the final sentence: "And this is the anagram-made<br>Method." Strictly speaking this sentence is unnecessary, for we have<br>already seen the anagram decyphered, but the mock-solemn repetition, in<br>which one seems to hear Swift's own voice uttering the words, drives home<br>the idiocy of the activities described, like the final tap to a nail. But<br>not all the power and simplicity of Swift's prose, nor the imaginative<br>effort that has been able to make not one but a whole series of<br>impossible worlds more credible than the majority of history books--none<br>of this would enable us to enjoy Swift if his world-view were truly<br>wounding or shocking. Millions of people, in many countries, must have<br>enjoyed GULLIVER'S TRAVELS while more or less seeing its anti-human<br>implications: and even the child who accepts Parts i and n as a simple<br>story gets a sense of absurdity from thinking of human beings six inches<br>high. The explanation must be that Swift's world-view is felt to be NOT<br>altogether false--or it would probably be more accurate to say, not<br>false all the time. Swift is a diseased writer. He remains permanently in<br>a depressed mood which in most people is only intermittent, rather as<br>though someone suffering from jaundice or the after-effects of influenza<br>should have the energy to write books. But we all know that mood, and<br>something in us responds to the expression of it. Take, for instance, one<br>of his most characteristic works, The Lady's Dressing Room: one might add<br>the kindred poem, Upon a Beautiful Young Nymph Going to Bed. Which is<br>truer, the viewpoint expressed in these poems, or the viewpoint implied<br>in Blake's phrase, "The naked female human form divine"? No doubt Blake<br>is nearer the truth, and yet who can fail to feel a sort of pleasure in<br>seeing that fraud, feminine delicacy, exploded for once? Swift falsifies<br>his picture of the world by refusing to see anything in human life except<br>dirt, folly and wickedness, but the part which he abstracts from the<br>whole does exist, and it is something which we all know about while<br>shrinking from mentioning it. Part of our minds--in any normal person it<br>is the dominant part--believes that man is a noble animal and life is<br>worth living: but there is also a sort of inner self which at least<br>intermittently stands aghast at the horror of existence. In the queerest<br>way, pleasure and disgust are linked together. The human body is<br>beautiful: it is also repulsive and ridiculous, a fact which can be<br>verified at any swimming pool. The sexual organs are objects of desire<br>and also of loathing, so much so that in many languages, if not in all<br>languages, their names are used as words of abuse. Meat is delicious, but<br>a butcher's shop makes one feel sick: and indeed all our food springs<br>ultimately from dung and dead bodies, the two things which of all others<br>seem to us the most horrible. A child, when it is past the infantile<br>stage but still looking at the world with fresh eyes, is moved by horror<br>almost as often as by wonder--horror of snot and spittle, of the dogs'<br>excrement on the pavement, the dying toad full of maggots, the sweaty<br>smell of grown-ups, the hideousness of old men, with their bald heads and<br>bulbous noses. In his endless harping on disease, dirt and deformity,<br>Swift is not actually inventing anything, he is merely leaving something<br>out. Human behaviour, too, especially in politics, is as he describes it,<br>although it contains other more important factors which he refuses to<br>admit. So far as we can see, both horror and pain are necessary to the<br>continuance of life on this planet, and it is therefore open to<br>pessimists like Swift to say: "If horror and pain must always be with<br>us, how can life be significantly improved?" His attitude is in effect<br>the Christian attitude, minus the bribe of a "next world"--which,<br>however, probably has less hold upon the minds of believers than the<br>conviction that this world is a vale of tears and the grave is a place of<br>rest. It is, I am certain, a wrong attitude, and one which could have<br>harmful effects upon behaviour; but something in us responds to it, as it<br>responds to the gloomy words of the burial service and the sweetish smell<br>of corpses in a country church.<br><br>It is often argued, at least by people who admit the importance of<br>subject-matter, that a book cannot be "good" if it expresses a palpably<br>false view of life. We are told that in our own age, for instance, any<br>book that has genuine literary merit will also be more or less<br>"progressive" in tendency. This ignores the fact that throughout history<br>a similar struggle between progress and reaction has been raging, and<br>that the best books of any one age have always been written from several<br>different viewpoints, some of them palpably more false than others. In so<br>far as a writer is a propagandist, the most one can ask of him is that he<br>shall genuinely believe in what he is saying, and that it shall not be<br>something blazingly silly. To-day, for example, one can imagine a good<br>book being written by a Catholic, a Communist, a Fascist, pacifist, an<br>anarchist, perhaps by an old-style Liberal or an ordinary Conservative:<br>one cannot imagine a good book being written by a spiritualist, a<br>Buchmanite or a member of the Ku-Klux-KIan. The views that a writer holds<br>must be compatible with sanity, in the medical sense, and with the power<br>of continuous thought: beyond that what we ask of him is talent, which is<br>probably another name for conviction. Swift did not possess ordinary<br>wisdom, but he did possess a terrible intensity of vision, capable of<br>picking out a single hidden truth and then magnifying it and distorting<br>it. The durability of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS goes to show that, if the force<br>of belief is behind it, a world-view which only just passes the test of<br>sanity is sufficient to produce a great work of art.<br><br></font></p>
