<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Mark Twain has crashed the lofty gates of the Everyman library, but only<br>with TOM SAWYER and HUCKLEBERRY FINN, already fairly well known under the<br>guise of 'children's books' (which they are not). His best and most<br>characteristic books, ROUGHING IT, THE INNOCENTS AT HOME, and even LIFE<br>ON THE MISSISSIPPI, are little remembered in this country, though no<br>doubt in America the patriotism which is everywhere mixed up with<br>literary judgement keeps them alive.<br><br>Although Mark Twain produced a surprising variety of books, ranging from<br>a namby-pamby 'life' of Joan of Arc to a pamphlet so obscene that it has<br>never been publicly printed, all that is best in his work centres about<br>the Mississippi river and the wild mining towns of the West. Born in 1835<br>(he came of a Southern family, a family just rich enough to own one or<br>perhaps two slaves), he had had his youth and early manhood in the golden<br>age of America, the period when the great plains were opened up, when<br>wealth and opportunity seemed limitless, and human beings felt free,<br>indeed were free, as they had never been before and may not be again for<br>centuries. LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI and the two other books that I have<br>mentioned are a ragbag of anecdotes, scenic descriptions and social<br>history both serious and burlesque, but they have a central theme which<br>could perhaps be put into these words: 'This is how human beings behave<br>when they are not frightened of the sack.' In writing these books Mark<br>Twain is not consciously writing a hymn to liberty. Primarily he is<br>interested in 'character', in the fantastic, almost lunatic variations<br>which human nature is capable of when economic pressure and tradition are<br>both removed from it. The raftsmen, Mississippi pilots, miners and<br>bandits whom he describes are probably not much exaggerated, but they are<br>as different from modern men, and from one another, as the gargoyles of a<br>medieval cathedral. They could develop their strange and sometimes<br>sinister individuality because of the lack of any outside pressure. The<br>State hardly existed, the churches were weak and spoke with many voices,<br>and land was to be had for the taking. If you disliked your job you<br>simply hit the boss in the eye and moved further west; and moreover,<br>money was so plentiful that the smallest coin in circulation was worth a<br>shilling. The American pioneers were not supermen, and they were not<br>especially courageous. Whole towns of hardy gold miners let themselves be<br>terrorized by bandits whom they lacked the public spirit to put down.<br>They were not even free from class distinctions. The desperado who<br>stalked through the streets of the mining settlement, with a Derringer<br>pistol in his waistcoat pocket and twenty corpses to his credit, was<br>dressed in a frock coat and shiny top-hat, described himself firmly as a<br>'gentleman' and was meticulous about table manners. But at least it was<br>NOT the case that a man's destiny was settled from his birth. The 'log<br>cabin to White House' myth was true while the free land lasted. In a way,<br>it was for this that the Paris mob had stormed the Bastille, and when one<br>reads Mark Twain, Bret Harte and Whitman it is hard to feel that their<br>effort was wasted.<br><br>However, Mark Twain aimed at being something more than a chronicler of<br>the Mississippi and the Gold Rush. In his own day he was famous all over<br>the world as a humorist and comic lecturer. In New York, London, Berlin,<br>Vienna, Melbourne and Calcutta vast audiences rocked with laughter over<br>jokes which have now, almost without exception, ceased to be funny. (It<br>is worth noticing that Mark Twain's lectures were only a success with<br>Anglo-Saxon and German audiences. The relatively grown-up Latin races--<br>whose own humour, he complained, always centred round sex and politics--<br>never cared for them.) But in addition, Mark Twain had some pretensions<br>to being a social critic, even a species of philosopher. He had in him an<br>iconoclastic, even revolutionary vein which he obviously wanted to follow<br>up and yet somehow never did follow up. He might have been a destroyer of<br>humbugs and a prophet of democracy more valuable than Whitman, because<br>healthier and more humorous. Instead he became that dubious thing a<br>'public figure', flattered by passport officials and entertained by<br>royalty, and his career reflects the deterioration in American life that<br>set in after the Civil War.<br><br>Mark Twain has sometimes been compared with his contemporary, Anatole<br>France. This comparison is not so pointless as it may sound. Both men<br>were the spiritual children of Voltaire, both had an ironical, sceptical<br>view of life, and a native pessimism overlaid by gaiety; both knew that<br>the existing social order is a swindle and its cherished beliefs mostly<br>delusions. Both were bigoted atheists and convinced (in Mark Twain's case<br>this was Darwin's doing) of the unbearable cruelty of the universe. But<br>there the resemblance ends. Not only is the Frenchman enormously more<br>learned, more civilized, more alive aesthetically, but he is also more<br>courageous. He does attack the things he disbelieves in; he does not,<br>like Mark swain, always take refuge behind the amiable mask of the<br>'public figure' and the licensed jester. He is ready to risk the anger of<br>the Church and to take the unpopular side in a controversy--in the<br>Dreyfus case, for example. Mark Twain, except perhaps in one short essay<br>'What is Man?', never attacks established beliefs in a way that is likely<br>to get him into trouble. Nor could he ever wean himself from the notion,<br>which is perhaps especially an American notion, that success and virtue<br>are the same thing.<br><br>In LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI there is a queer little illustration of the<br>central weakness of Mark Twain's character. In the earlier part of this<br>mainly autobiographical book the dates have been altered. Mark Twain<br>describes his adventures as a Mississippi pilot as though he had been a<br>boy of about seventeen at the time, whereas in fact he was a young man of<br>nearly thirty. There is a reason for this. The same part of the book<br>describes his exploits in the Civil War, which were distinctly<br>inglorious. Moreover, Mark Twain started by fighting, if he can be said<br>to have fought, on the Southern side, and then changed his allegiance<br>before the war was over. This kind of behaviour is more excusable in a<br>boy than in a man, whence the adjustment of the dates. It is also clear<br>enough, however, that he changed sides because he saw that the North was<br>going to win; and this tendency to side with the stronger whenever<br>possible, to believe that might must be right, is apparent throughout his<br>career. In ROUGHING IT there is an interesting account of a bandit named<br>Slade, who, among countless other outrages, had committed twenty-eight<br>murders. It is perfectly clear that Mark Twain admires this disgusting<br>scoundrel. Slade was successful; therefore he was admirable. This<br>outlook, no less common today, is summed up in the significant American<br>expression 'to MAKE GOOD'.<br><br>In the money-grubbing period that followed the Civil War it was hard for<br>anyone of Mark Twain's temperament to refuse to be a success. The old,<br>simple, stump-whittling, tobacco-chewing democracy which Abraham Lincoln<br>typified was perishing: it was now the age of cheap immigrant labour and<br>the growth of Big Business. Mark Twain mildly satirized his<br>contemporaries in The GILDED AGE, but he also gave himself up to the<br>prevailing fever, and made and lost vast sums of money. He even for a<br>period of years deserted writing for business; and he squandered his time<br>on buffooneries, not merely lecture tours and public banquets, but, for<br>instance, the writing of a book like A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING<br>ARTHUR'S COURT, which is a deliberate flattery of all that is worst and<br>most vulgar in American life. The man who might have been a kind of<br>rustic Voltaire became the world's leading after-dinner speaker, charming<br>alike for his anecdotes and his power to make businessmen feel themselves<br>public benefactors.<br><br>It is usual to blame Mark Twain's wife for his failure to write the books<br>he ought to have written, and it is evident that she did tyrannize over<br>him pretty thoroughly. Each morning, Mark Twain would show her what he<br>had written the day before, and Mrs. Clemens (Mark Twain's real name was<br>Samuel Clemens) would go over it with the blue pencil, cutting out<br>everything that she thought unsuitable. She seems to have been a drastic<br>blue-penciller even by nineteenth-century standards. There is an account<br>in W.D. Howells's book MY MARK TWAIN of the fuss that occurred over a<br>terrible expletive that had crept into HUCKLEBERRY FINN. Mark Twain<br>appealed to Howells, who admitted that it was 'just what Huck would have<br>said', but agreed with Mrs. Clemens that the word could not possibly be<br>printed. The word was 'hell'. Nevertheless, no writer is really the<br>intellectual slave of his wife. Mrs. Clemens could not have stopped Mark<br>Twain writing any book he really wanted to write. She may have made his<br>surrender to society easier, but the surrender happened because of that<br>flaw in his own nature, his inability to despise success.<br><br>Several of Mark Twain's books are bound to survive, because they contain<br>invaluable social history. His life covered the great period of American<br>expansion. When he was a child it was a normal day's outing to go with a<br>picnic lunch and watch the hanging of an Abolitionist, and when he died<br>the aeroplane was ceasing to be a novelty. This period in America<br>produced relatively little literature, and but for Mark Twain our picture<br>of a Mississippi paddle-steamer, or a stage-coach crossing the plains,<br>would be much dimmer than it is. But most people who have studied his<br>work have come away with a feeling that he might have done something<br>more. He gives all the while a strange impression of being about to say<br>something and then funking it, so that LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI and the<br>rest of them seem to be haunted by the ghost of a greater and much more<br>coherent book. Significantly, he starts his autobiography by remarking<br>that a man's inner life is indescribable. We do not know what he would<br>have said--it is just possible that the unprocurable pamphlet, 1601,<br>would supply a clue but we may guess that it would have wrecked his<br>reputation and reduced his income to reasonable proportions.<br><br></font></p>
