<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">As the corpse went past the flies left the restaurant table in a cloud<br>and rushed after it, but they came back a few minutes later.<br><br>The little crowd of mourners-all men and boys, no women--threaded<br>their way across the market-place between the piles of pomegranates<br>and the taxis and the camels, wailing a short chant over and over<br>again. What really appeals to the flies is that the corpses here<br>are never put into coffins, they are merely wrapped in a piece of<br>rag and carried on a rough wooden bier on the shoulders of four friends.<br>When the friends get to the burying-ground they hack an oblong hole a<br>foot or two deep, dump the body in it and fling over it a little of the<br>dried-up, lumpy earth, which is like broken brick. No gravestone, no<br>name, no identifying mark of any kind. The burying-ground is merely a<br>huge waste of hummocky earth, like a derelict building-lot. After a month<br>or two no one can even be certain where his own relatives are buried.<br><br>When you walk through a town like this--two hundred thousand inhabitants,<br>of whom at least twenty thousand own literally nothing except the rags<br>they stand up in--when you see how the people live, and still more how<br>easily they die, it is always difficult to believe that you are walking<br>among human beings. All colonial empires are in reality founded upon<br>that fact. The people have brown faces--besides, there are so many of<br>them! Are they really the same flesh as yourself? Do they even have<br>names? Or are they merely a kind of undifferentiated brown stuff, about<br>as individual as bees or coral insects? They rise out of the earth, they<br>sweat and starve for a few years, and then they sink back into the<br>nameless mounds of the graveyard and nobody notices that they are gone.<br>And even the graves themselves soon fade back into the soil. Sometimes,<br>out for a walk, as you break your way through the prickly pear, you<br>notice that it is rather bumpy underfoot, and only a certain regularity<br>in the bumps tells you that you are walking over skeletons.<br><br><br>I was feeding one of the gazelles in the public gardens.<br><br>Gazelles are almost the only animals that look good to eat when they are<br>still alive, in fact, one can hardly look at their hindquarters without<br>thinking of mint sauce. The gazelle I was feeding seemed to know that<br>this thought was in my mind, for though it took the piece of bread I was<br>holding out it obviously did not like me. It nibbled rapidly at the<br>bread, then lowered its head and tried to butt me, then took another<br>nibble and then butted again. Probably its idea was that if it could<br>drive me away the bread would somehow remain hanging in mid-air.<br><br>An Arab navvy working on the path nearby lowered his heavy hoe and<br>sidled towards us. He looked from the gazelle to the bread and from the<br>bread to the gazelle, with a sort of quiet amazement, as though he had<br>never seen anything quite like this before. Finally he said shyly in<br>French:<br><br>"_I_ could eat some of that bread."<br><br>I tore off a piece and he stowed it gratefully in some secret place<br>under his rags. This man is an employee of the Municipality.<br><br><br>When you go through the Jewish quarters you gather some idea of what the<br>medieval ghettoes were probably like. Under their Moorish rulers the<br>Jews were only allowed to own land in certain restricted areas, and<br>after centuries of this kind of treatment they have ceased to bother<br>about overcrowding. Many of the streets are a good deal less than six<br>feet wide, the houses are completely windowless, and sore-eyed children<br>cluster everywhere in unbelievable numbers, like clouds of flies. Down<br>the centre of the street there is generally running a little river of<br>urine.<br><br>In the bazaar huge families of Jews, all dressed in the long black robe<br>and little black skull-cap, are working in dark fly-infested booths that<br>look like caves. A carpenter sits cross-legged at a prehistoric lathe,<br>turning chair-legs at lightning speed. He works the lathe with a bow in<br>his right hand and guides the chisel with his left foot, and thanks to a<br>lifetime of sitting in this position his left leg is warped out of<br>shape. At his side his grandson, aged six, is already starting on the<br>simpler parts of the job.<br><br>I was just passing the coppersmiths' booths when somebody noticed that I<br>was lighting a cigarette. Instantly, from the dark holes all round,<br>there was a frenzied rush of Jews, many of them old grandfathers with<br>flowing grey beards, all clamouring for a cigarette. Even a blind man<br>somewhere at the back of one of the booths heard a rumour of cigarettes<br>and came crawling out, groping in the air with his hand. In about a<br>minute I had used up the whole packet. None of these people, I suppose,<br>works less than twelve hours a day, and every one of them looks on a<br>cigarette as a more or less impossible luxury.<br><br>As the Jews live in self-contained communities they follow the same<br>trades as the Arabs, except for agriculture. Fruit-sellers, potters,<br>silversmiths, blacksmiths, butchers, leather-workers, tailors,<br>water-carriers, beggars, porters--whichever way you look you see nothing<br>but Jews. As a matter of fact there are thirteen thousand of them, all<br>living in the space of a few acres. A good job Hitler isn't here.<br>Perhaps he is on his way, however. You hear the usual dark rumours about<br>the Jews, not only from the Arabs but from the poorer Europeans.<br><br>"Yes, MON VIEUX, they took my job away from me and gave it to a Jew. The<br>Jews! They're the real rulers of this country, you know. They've got all<br>the money. They control the banks, finance--everything."<br><br>"But," I said, "isn't it a fact that the average Jew is a labourer<br>working for about a penny an hour?"<br><br>"Ah, that's only for show! They're all money-lenders really. They're<br>cunning, the Jews."<br><br>In just the same way, a couple of hundred years ago, poor old women used<br>to be burned for witchcraft when they could not even work enough magic<br>to get themselves a square meal.<br><br><br>All people who work with their hands are partly invisible, and the more<br>important the work they do, the less visible they are. Still, a white<br>skin is always fairly conspicuous. In northern Europe, when you see a<br>labourer ploughing a field, you probably give him a second glance. In a<br>hot country, anywhere south of Gibraltar or east of Suez, the chances<br>are that you don't even see him. I have noticed this again and again. In<br>a tropical landscape one's eye takes in everything except the human<br>beings. It takes in the dried-up soil, the prickly pear, the palm-tree<br>and the distant mountain, but it always misses the peasant hoeing at his<br>patch. He is the same colour as the earth, and a great deal less<br>interesting to look at.<br><br>It is only because of this that the starved countries of Asia and Africa<br>are accepted as tourist resorts. No one would think of running cheap<br>trips to the Distressed Areas. But where the human beings have brown<br>skins their poverty is simply not noticed. What does Morocco mean to a<br>Frenchman? An orange-grove or a job in government service. Or to an<br>Englishman? Camels, castles, palm-trees, Foreign Legionnaires, brass<br>trays and bandits. One could probably live here for years without<br>noticing that for nine-tenths of the people the reality of life is an<br>endless, back-breaking struggle to wring a little food out of an eroded<br>soil.<br><br>Most of Morocco is so desolate that no wild animal bigger than a hare<br>can live on it. Huge areas which were once covered with forest have<br>turned into a treeless waste where the soil is exactly like broken-up<br>brick. Nevertheless a good deal of it is cultivated, with frightful<br>labour. Everything is done by hand. Long lines of women, bent double<br>like inverted capital Ls, work their way slowly across the fields,<br>tearing up the prickly weeds with their hands, and the peasant gathering<br>lucerne for fodder pulls it up stalk by stalk instead of reaping it,<br>thus saving an inch or two on each stalk. The plough is a wretched<br>wooden thing, so frail that one can easily carry it on one's shoulder,<br>and fitted underneath with a rough iron spike which stirs the soil to a<br>depth of about four inches. This is as much as the strength of the<br>animals is equal to. It is usual to plough with a cow and a donkey yoked<br>together. Two donkeys would not be quite strong enough, but on the other<br>hand two cows would cost a little more to feed. The peasants possess no<br>harrows, they merely plough the soil several times over in different<br>directions, finally leaving it in rough furrows, after which the whole<br>field has to be shaped with hoes into small oblong patches, to conserve<br>water. Except for a day or two after the rare rainstorms there is never<br>enough water. Along the edges of the fields channels are hacked out to a<br>depth of thirty or forty feet to get at the tiny trickles which run<br>through the subsoil.<br><br>Every afternoon a file of very old women passes down the road outside my<br>house, each carrying a load of firewood. All of them are mummified with<br>age and the sun, and all of them are tiny. It seems to be generally the<br>case in primitive communities that the women, when they get beyond a<br>certain age, shrink to the size of children. One day a poor old creature<br>who could not have been more than four feet tall crept past me under a<br>vast load of wood. I stopped her and put a five-sou piece (a little more<br>than a farthing) into her hand. She answered with a shrill wail, almost<br>a scream, which was partly gratitude but mainly surprise. I suppose that<br>from her point of view, by taking any notice of her, I seemed almost to<br>be violating a law of nature. She accepted her status as an old woman,<br>that is to say as a beast of burden. When a family is travelling it is<br>quite usual to see a father and a grown-up son riding ahead on donkeys,<br>and an old woman following on foot, carrying the baggage.<br><br>But what is strange about these people is their invisibility. For<br>several weeks, always at about the same time of day, the file of old<br>women had hobbled past the house with their firewood, and though they<br>had registered themselves on my eyeballs I cannot truly say that I had<br>seen them. Firewood was passing--that was how I saw it. It was only that<br>one day I happened to be walking behind them, and the curious up-and-down<br>motion of a load of wood drew my attention to the human being underneath<br>it. Then for the first time I noticed the poor old earth-coloured<br>bodies, bodies reduced to bones and leathery skin, bent double under the<br>crushing weight. Yet I suppose I had not been five minutes on Moroccan<br>soil before I noticed the overloading of the donkeys and was infuriated<br>by it. There is no question that the donkeys are damnably treated. The<br>Moroccan donkey is hardly bigger than a St Bernard dog, it carries a<br>load which in the British army would be considered too much for a<br>fifteen-hands mule, and very often its pack-saddle is not taken off its<br>back for weeks together. But what is peculiarly pitiful is that it is<br>the most willing creature on earth, it follows its master like a dog and<br>does not need either bridle or halter. After a dozen years of devoted<br>work it suddenly drops dead, whereupon its master tips it into the ditch<br>and the village dogs have torn its guts out before it is cold.<br><br>This kind of thing makes one's blood boil, whereas--on the whole--the<br>plight of the human beings does not. I am not commenting, merely<br>pointing to a fact. People with brown skins are next door to invisible.<br>Anyone can be sorry for the donkey with its galled back, but it is<br>generally owing to some kind of accident if one even notices the old<br>woman under her load of sticks.<br><br><br><br>As the storks flew northward the Negroes were marching southward--a<br>long, dusty column, infantry, screw-gun batteries and then more<br>infantry, four or five thousand men in all, winding up the road with a<br>clumping of boots and a clatter of iron wheels.<br><br>They were Senegalese, the blackest Negroes in Africa, so black that<br>sometimes it is difficult to see whereabouts on their necks the hair<br>begins. Their splendid bodies were hidden in reach-me-down khaki<br>uniforms, their feet squashed into boots that looked like blocks of<br>wood, and every tin hat seemed to be a couple of sizes too small. It was<br>very hot and the men had marched a long way. They slumped under the<br>weight of their packs and the curiously sensitive black faces were<br>glistening with sweat.<br><br>As they went past a tall, very young Negro turned and caught my eye. But<br>the look he gave me was not in the least the kind of look you might<br>expect. Not hostile, not contemptuous, not sullen, not even inquisitive.<br>It was the shy, wide-eyed Negro look, which actually is a look of<br>profound respect. I saw how it was. This wretched boy, who is a French<br>citizen and has therefore been dragged from the forest to scrub floors<br>and catch syphilis in garrison towns, actually has feelings of reverence<br>before a white skin. He has been taught that the white race are his<br>masters, and he still believes it.<br><br>But there is one thought which every white man (and in this connection<br>it doesn't matter twopence if he calls himself a Socialist) thinks when<br>he sees a black army marching past. "How much longer can we go on<br>kidding these people? How long before they tum their guns in the other<br>direction?"<br><br>It was curious, really. Every white man there has this thought stowed<br>somewhere or other in his mind. I had it, so had the other onlookers, so<br>had the officers on their sweating chargers and the white NCOs marching<br>in the ranks. It was a kind of secret which we all knew and were too<br>clever to tell; only the Negroes didn't know it. And really it was<br>almost like watching a flock of cattle to see the long column, a mile or<br>two miles of armed men, flowing peacefully up the road, while the great<br>white birds drifted over them in the opposite direction, glittering like<br>scraps of paper.<br><br></font></p>
