<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Nearly half a century after his first appearance, Raffles, 'the amateur<br>cracksman', is still one of the best-known characters in English fiction.<br>Very few people would need telling that he played cricket for England,<br>had bachelor chambers in the Albany and burgled the Mayfair houses which<br>he also entered as a guest. Just for that reason he and his exploits make<br>a suitable background against which to examine a more modern crime story<br>such as NO ORCHIDS FOR MISS BLANDISH. Any such choice is necessarily<br>arbitrary--I might equally well have chosen ARSÈNE LUPIN for instance--<br>but at any rate NO ORCHIDS and the Raffles books [Note, below] have the<br>common quality of being crime stories which play the limelight on the<br>criminal rather than the policeman. For sociological purposes they can be<br>compared. NO ORCHIDS is the 1939 version of glamorized crime, RAFFLES the<br>1900 version. What I am concerned with here is the immense difference in<br>moral atmosphere between the two books, and the change in the popular<br>attitude that this probably implies.<br><br><br>[Note: RAFFLES, A THIEF IN THE NIGHT and MR. JUSTICE RAFFLES, by E. W.<br>Hornung. The third of these is definitely a failure, and only the first<br>has the true Raffles atmosphere. Hornung wrote a number of crime stories,<br>usually with a tendency to take the side of the criminal. A successful<br>book in rather the same vein as RAFFLES is STIUGAREE. (Author's footnote.)]<br><br><br>At this date, the charm of RAFFLES is partly in the period atmosphere and<br>partly in the technical excellence of the stories. Hornung was a very<br>conscientious and on his level a very able writer. Anyone who cares for<br>sheer efficiency must admire his work. However, the truly dramatic thing,<br>about Raffles, the thing that makes him a sort of byword even to this day<br>(only a few weeks ago, in a burglary case, a magistrate referred to the<br>prisoner as 'a Raffles in real life'), is the fact that he is a<br>GENTLEMAN. Raffles is presented to us and this is rubbed home in<br>countless scraps of dialogue and casual remarks--not as an honest man<br>who has gone astray, but as a public-school man who has gone astray. His<br>remorse, when he feels any, is almost purely social; he has disgraced<br>'the old school', he has lost his right to enter 'decent society', he has<br>forfeited his amateur status and become a cad. Neither Raffles nor Bunny<br>appears to feel at all strongly that stealing is wrong in itself, though<br>Raffles does once justify himself by the casual remark that 'the<br>distribution of property is all wrong anyway'. They think of themselves<br>not as sinners but as renegades, or simply as outcasts. And the moral<br>code of most of us is still so close to Raffles' own that we do feel his<br>situation to be an especially ironical one. A West End club man who is<br>really a burglar! That is almost a story in itself, is it not? But how if<br>it were a plumber or a greengrocer who was really a burglar? Would there<br>be anything inherently dramatic in that? No although the theme of the<br>'double life', of respectability covering crime, is still there. Even<br>Charles Peace in his clergyman's dog-collar, seems somewhat less of a<br>hypocrite than Raffles in his Zingari blazer.<br><br>Raffles, of course, is good at all games, but it is peculiarly fitting<br>that his chosen game should be cricket. This allows not only of endless<br>analogies between his cunning as a slow bowler and his cunning as a<br>burglar, but also helps to define the exact nature of his crime. Cricket<br>is not in reality a very popular game in England--it is nowhere so<br>popular as football, for instance--but it gives expression to a<br>well-marked trait in the English character, the tendency to value 'form'<br>or 'style' more highly than success. In the eyes of any true<br>cricket-lover it is possible for an innings of ten runs to be 'better'<br>(i.e. more elegant) than an innings of a hundred runs: cricket is also<br>one of the very few games in which the amateur can excel the<br>professional. It is a game full of forlorn hopes and sudden dramatic<br>changes of fortune, and its rules are so defined that their<br>interpretation is partly an ethical business. When Larwood, for instance,<br>practised bodyline bowling in Australia he was not actually breaking any<br>rule: he was merely doing something that was 'not cricket'. Since<br>cricket takes up a lot of time and is rather an expensive game to play,<br>it is predominantly an upper-class game, but for the whole nation it is<br>bound up with such concepts as 'good form', 'playing the game', etc., and<br>it has declined in popularity just as the tradition of 'don't hit a man<br>when he's down' has declined. It is not a twentieth-century game, and<br>nearly all modern-minded people dislike it. The Nazis, for instance, were<br>at pains to discourage cricket, which had gained a certain footing in<br>Germany before and after the last war. In making Raffles a cricketer as<br>well as a burglar, Hornung was not merely providing him with a plausible<br>disguise; he was also drawing the sharpest moral contrast that he was<br>able to imagine.<br><br>RAFFLES, no less than GREAT EXPECTATIONS or LE ROUGE ET LE NOIR, is a<br>story of snobbery, and it gains a great deal from the precariousness of<br>Raffles's social position. A cruder writer would have made the 'gentleman<br>burglar' a member of the peerage, or at least a baronet. Raffles,<br>however, is of upper-middle-class origin and is only accepted by the<br>aristocracy because of his personal charm. 'We were in Society but not of<br>it', he says to Bunny towards the end of the book; and 'I was asked about<br>for my cricket'. Both he and Bunny accept the values of 'Society'<br>unquestioningly, and would settle down in it for good if only they could<br>get away with a big enough haul. The ruin that constantly threatens them<br>is all the blacker because they only doubtfully 'belong'. A duke who has<br>served a prison sentence is still a duke, whereas a mere man about town,<br>if once disgraced, ceases to be 'about town' for evermore. The closing<br>chapters of the book, when Raffles has been exposed and is living under<br>an assumed name, have a twilight of the gods feeling, a mental atmosphere<br>rather similar to that of Kipling's poem, 'Gentleman Rankers':<br><br>Yes, a trooper of the forces--<br>Who has run his own six horses! etc.<br><br>Raffles now belongs irrevocably to the 'cohorts of the damned'. He can<br>still commit successful burglaries, but there is no way back into<br>Paradise, which means Piccadilly and the M.C.C. According to the<br>public-school code there is only one means of rehabilitation: death in<br>battle. Raffles dies fighting against the Boers (a practised reader would<br>foresee this from the start), and in the eyes of both Bunny and his<br>creator this cancels his crimes.<br><br>Both Raffles and Bunny, of course, are devoid of religious belief, and<br>they have no real ethical code, merely certain rules of behaviour which<br>they observe semi-instinctively. But it is just here that the deep moral<br>difference between RAFFLES and NO ORCHIDS becomes apparent. Raffles and<br>Bunny, after all, are gentlemen, and such standards as they do have are<br>not to be violated. Certain things are 'not done', and the idea of doing<br>them hardly arises. Raffles will not, for example, abuse hospitality. He<br>will commit a burglary in a house where he is staying as a guest, but the<br>victim must be a fellow-guest and not the host. He will not commit<br>murder [Note, below], and he avoids violence wherever possible and prefers<br>to carry out his robberies unarmed. He regards friendship as sacred, and<br>is chivalrous though not moral in his relations with women. He will take<br>extra risks in the name of 'sportsmanship', and sometimes even for<br>aesthetic reasons. And above all, he is intensively patriotic. He<br>celebrates the Diamond Jubilee ('For sixty years, Bunny, we've been ruled<br>over by absolutely the finest sovereign the world has ever seen') by<br>dispatching to the Queen, through the post, an antique gold cup which he<br>has stolen from the British Museum. He steals, from partly political<br>motives, a pearl which the German Emperor is sending to one of the<br>enemies of Britain, and when the Boer War begins to go badly his one<br>thought is to find his way into the fighting line. At the front he<br>unmasks a spy at the cost of revealing his own identity, and then dies<br>gloriously by a Boer bullet. In this combination of crime and patriotism<br>he resembles his near-contemporary Arsène Lupin, who also scores off the<br>German Emperor and wipes out his very dirty past by enlisting in the<br>Foreign Legion.<br><br><br>[Note: Actually Raffles does kill one man and is more or less<br>consciously responsible for the death of two others. But all three of<br>them are foreigners and have behaved in a very reprehensible manner. He<br>also, on one occasion, contemplates murdering a blackmailer. It is<br>however, a fairly well-established convention in crime stories that<br>murdering a blackmailer 'doesn't count'. (Author's footnote, 1945.)]<br><br><br>It is important to note that by modern standards Raffles's crimes are<br>very petty ones. Four hundred pounds worth of jewellery seems to him an<br>excellent haul. And though the stories are convincing in their physical<br>detail, they contain very little sensationalism--very few corpses,<br>hardly any blood, no sex crimes, no sadism, no perversions of any kind.<br>It seems to be the case that the crime story, at any rate on its higher<br>levels, has greatly increased in blood-thirstiness during the past twenty<br>years. Some of the early detective stories do not even contain a murder.<br>The Sherlock Holmes stories, for instance, are not all murders, and some<br>of them do not even deal with an indictable crime. So also with the John<br>Thorndyke stories, while of the Max Carrados stories only a minority are<br>murders. Since 1918, however, a detective story not containing a murder<br>has been a great rarity, and the most disgusting details of dismemberment<br>and exhumation are commonly exploited. Some of the Peter Wimsey stories,<br>for instance, display an extremely morbid interest in corpses. The<br>Raffles stories, written from the angle of the criminal, are much less<br>anti-social than many modern stories written from the angle of the<br>detective. The main impression that they leave behind is of boyishness.<br>They belong to a time when people had standards, though they happened to<br>be foolish standards. Their key-phrase is 'not done'. The line that they<br>draw between good and evil is as senseless as a Polynesian taboo, but at<br>least, like the taboo, it has the advantage that everyone accepts it.<br><br>So much for RAFFLES. Now for a header into the cesspool. NO ORCHIDS FOR<br>MISS BLANDISH, by James Hadley Chase, was published in 1939, but seems to<br>have enjoyed its greatest popularity in 1940, during the Battle of<br>Britain and the blitz. In its main outlines its story is this:<br><br>Miss Blandish, the daughter of a millionaire, is kidnapped by some<br>gangsters who are almost immediately surprised and killed off by a larger<br>and better organized gang. They hold her to ransom and extract half a<br>million dollars from her father. Their original plan had been to kill her<br>as soon as the ransom-money was received, but a chance keeps her alive.<br>One of the gang is a young man named Slim, whose sole pleasure in life<br>consists in driving knives into other people's bellies. In childhood he<br>has graduated by cutting up living animals with a pair of rusty scissors.<br>Slim is sexually impotent, but takes a kind of fancy to Miss Blandish.<br>Slim's mother, who is the real brains of the gang, sees in this the<br>chance of curing Slim's impotence, and decides to keep Miss Blandish in<br>custody till Slim shall have succeeded in raping her. After many efforts<br>and much persuasion, including the flogging of Miss Blandish with a<br>length of rubber hosepipe, the rape is achieved. Meanwhile Miss<br>Blandish's father has hired a private detective, and by means of bribery<br>and torture the detective and the police manage to round up and<br>exterminate the whole gang. Slim escapes with Miss Blandish and is killed<br>after a final rape, and the detective prepares to restore Miss Blandish<br>to her family. By this time, however, she has developed such a taste for<br>Slim's caresses [Note, below] that she feels unable to live without him,<br>and she jumps, out of the window of a sky-scraper.<br><br>Several other points need noticing before one can grasp the full<br>implications of this book. To begin with, its central story bears a very<br>marked resemblance to William Faulkner's novel, Sanctuary. Secondly, it<br>is not, as one might expect, the product of an illiterate hack, but a<br>brilliant piece of writing, with hardly a wasted word or a jarring note<br>anywhere. Thirdly, the whole book, récit as well as dialogue, is written<br>in the American language; the author, an Englishman who has (I believe)<br>never been in the United States, seems to have made a complete mental<br>transference to the American underworld. Fourthly, the book sold,<br>according to its publishers, no less than half a million copies.<br><br>I have already outlined the plot, but the subject-matter is much more<br>sordid and brutal than this suggests. The book contains eight full-dress<br>murders, an unassessable number of casual killings and woundings, an<br>exhumation (with a careful reminder of the stench), the flogging of Miss<br>Blandish, the torture of another woman with red-hot cigarette-ends, a<br>strip-tease act, a third-degree scene of unheard-of cruelty and much else<br>of the same kind. It assumes great sexual sophistication in its readers<br>(there is a scene, for instance, in which a gangster, presumably of<br>masochistic tendency, has an orgasm in the moment of being knifed), and<br>it takes for granted the most complete corruption and self-seeking as the<br>norm of human behaviour. The detective, for instance, is almost as great<br>a rogue as the gangsters, and actuated by nearly the same motives. Like<br>them, he is in pursuit of 'five hundred grand'. It is necessary to the<br>machinery of the story that Mr. Blandish should be anxious to get his<br>daughter back, but apart from this, such things as affection, friendship,<br>good nature or even ordinary politeness simply do not enter. Nor, to any<br>great extent does normal sexuality. Ultimately only one motive is at work<br>throughout the whole story: the pursuit of power.<br><br><br>[Note: Another reading of the final episode is possible. It may mean<br>merely that Miss Blandish is pregnant. But the interpretation I have<br>given above seems more in keeping with the general brutality of the book.<br>(Author's footnote, 1945)]<br><br>It should be noticed that the book is not in the ordinary sense<br>pornography. Unlike most books that deal in sexual sadism, it lays the<br>emphasis on the cruelty and not on the pleasure. Slim, the ravisher of<br>Miss Blandish, has 'wet slobbering lips': this is disgusting, and it is<br>meant to be disgusting. But the scenes describing cruelty to women are<br>comparatively perfunctory. The real high-spots of the book are cruelties<br>committed by men upon other men; above all, the third-degreeing of the<br>gangster, Eddie Schultz, who is lashed into a chair and flogged on the<br>windpipe with truncheons, his arms broken by fresh blows as he breaks<br>loose. In another of Mr. Chase's books, HE WON'T NEED IT NOW, the hero,<br>who is intended to be a sympathetic and perhaps even noble character, is<br>described as stamping on somebody's face, and then, having crushed the<br>man's mouth in, grinding his heel round and round in it. Even when<br>physical incidents of this kind are not occurring, the mental atmosphere<br>of these books is always the same. Their whole theme is the struggle for<br>power and the triumph of the strong over the weak. The big gangsters wipe<br>out the little ones as mercilessly as a pike gobbling up the little fish<br>in a pond; the police kill off the criminals as cruelly as the angler<br>kills the pike. If ultimately one sides with the police against the<br>gangsters, it is merely because they are better organized and more<br>powerful, because, in fact, the law is a bigger racket than crime. Might<br>is right: vae victis.<br><br>As I have mentioned already, NO ORCHIDS enjoyed its greatest vogue in<br>1940, though it was successfully running as a play till some time later.<br>It was, in fact, one of the things that helped to console people for the<br>boredom of being bombed. Early in the war the NEW YORKER had a picture of<br>a little man approaching a news-stall littered with paper with such<br>headlines as 'Great Tank Battles in Northern France', 'Big Naval Battle<br>in the North Sea', 'Huge Air Battles over the Channel', etc., etc. The<br>little man is saying 'ACTION STORIES, please'. That little man stood for<br>all the drugged millions to whom the world of the gangster and the<br>prize-ring is more 'real', more 'tough', than such things as wars,<br>revolutions, earthquakes, famines and pestilences. From the point of view<br>of a reader of ACTION STORIES, a description of the London blitz, or of<br>the struggles of the European underground parties, would be 'sissy<br>stuff'. On the other hand, some puny gun-battle in Chicago, resulting in<br>perhaps half a dozen deaths, would seem genuinely 'tough'. This habit of<br>mind is now extremely widespread. A soldier sprawls in a muddy trench,<br>with the machine-gun bullets crackling a foot or two overhead, and whiles<br>away his intolerable boredom by reading an American gangster story. And<br>what is it that makes that story so exciting? Precisely the fact that<br>people are shooting at each other with machine-guns! Neither the soldier<br>nor anyone else sees anything curious in this. It is taken for granted<br>that an imaginary bullet is more thrilling than a real one.<br><br>The obvious explanation is that in real life one is usually a passive<br>victim, whereas in the adventure story one can think of oneself as being<br>at the centre of events. But there is more to it than that. Here it is<br>necessary to refer again to the curious fact of NO ORCHIDS being written<br>--with technical errors, perhaps, but certainly with considerable skill--<br>in the American language.<br><br>There exists in America an enormous literature of more or less the same<br>stamp as NO ORCHIDS. Quite apart from books, there is the huge array of<br>'pulp magazines', graded so as to cater for different kinds of fantasy,<br>but nearly all having much the same mental atmosphere. A few of them go<br>in for straight pornography, but the great majority are quite plainly<br>aimed at sadists and masochists. Sold at threepence a copy under the<br>title of Yank Mags, [Note, below] these things used to enjoy considerable<br>popularity in England, but when the supply dried up owing to the war, no<br>satisfactory substitute was forthcoming. English imitations of the 'pulp<br>magazine' do now exist, but they are poor things compared with the<br>original. English crook films, again, never approach the American crook<br>film in brutality. And yet the career of Mr. Chase shows how deep the<br>American influence has already gone. Not only is he himself living a<br>continuous fantasy-life in the Chicago underworld, but he can count on<br>hundreds of thousands of readers who know what is meant by a 'clipshop'<br>or the 'hotsquat', do not have to do mental arithmetic when confronted by<br>'fifty grand', and understand at sight a sentence like 'Johnny was a<br>rummy and only two jumps ahead of the nut-factory'. Evidently there are<br>great numbers of English people who are partly americanized in language<br>and, one ought to add, in moral outlook. For there was no popular protest<br>against NO ORCHIDS. In the end it was withdrawn, but only<br>retrospectively, when a later work, MISS CALLAGHAN COMES TO GRIEF,<br>brought Mr. Chase's books to the attention of the authorities. Judging by<br>casual conversations at the time, ordinary readers got a mild thrill out<br>of the obscenities of NO ORCHIDS, but saw nothing undesirable in the book<br>as a whole. Many people, incidentally, were under the impression that it<br>was an American book reissued in England.<br><br><br><br>[Note: They are said to have been imported into this country as ballast<br>which accounted for their low price and crumped appearance. Since the war<br>the ships have been ballasted with something more useful, probably<br>gravel. (Author's footnote)]<br><br><br>The thing that the ordinary reader OUGHT to have objected to--almost<br>certainly would have objected to, a few decades earlier--was the<br>equivocal attitude towards crime. It is implied throughout NO ORCHIDS<br>that being a criminal is only reprehensible in the sense that it does not<br>pay. Being a policeman pays better, but there is no moral difference,<br>since the police use essentially criminal methods. In a book like HE<br>WON'T NEED IT NOW the distinction between crime and crime-prevention<br>practically disappears. This is a new departure for English sensational<br>fiction, in which till recently there has always been a sharp distinction<br>between right and wrong and a general agreement that virtue must triumph<br>in the last chapter. English books glorifying crime (modern crime, that<br>is--pirates and highwaymen are different) are very rare. Even a book<br>like RAFFLES, as I have pointed out, is governed by powerful taboos, and<br>it is clearly understood that Raffles's crimes must be expiated sooner or<br>later. In America, both in life and fiction, the tendency to tolerate<br>crime, even to admire the criminal so long as he is success, is very much<br>more marked. It is, indeed, ultimately this attitude that has made it<br>possible for crime to flourish upon so huge a scale. Books have been<br>written about Al Capone that are hardly different in tone from the books<br>written about Henry Ford, Stalin, Lord Northcliffe and all the rest of<br>the 'log cabin to White House' brigade. And switching back eighty years,<br>one finds Mark Twain adopting much the same attitude towards the<br>disgusting bandit Slade, hero of twenty-eight murders, and towards the<br>Western desperadoes generally. They were successful, they 'made good',<br>therefore he admired them.<br><br>In a book like NO ORCHIDS one is not, as in the old-style crime story,<br>simply escaping from dull reality into an imaginary world of action.<br>One's escape is essentially into cruelty and sexual perversion. No<br>Orchids is aimed at the power-instinct, which RAFFLES or the Sherlock<br>Holmes stories are not. At the same time the English attitude towards<br>crime is not so superior to the American as I may have seemed to imply.<br>It too is mixed up with power-worship, and has become more noticeably so<br>in the last twenty years. A writer who is worth examining is Edgar<br>Wallace, especially in such typical books as THE ORATOR and the Mr. J. G.<br>Reeder stories. Wallace was one of the first crime-story writers to break<br>away from the old tradition of the private detective and make his central<br>figure a Scotland Yard official. Sherlock Holmes is an amateur, solving<br>his problems without the help and even, in the earlier stories, against<br>the opposition of the police. Moreover, like Lupin, he is essentially an<br>intellectual, even a scientist. He reasons logically from observed fact,<br>and his intellectuality is constantly contrasted with the routine methods<br>of the police. Wallace objected strongly to this slur, as he considered<br>it, on Scotland Yard, and in several newspaper articles he went out of<br>his way to denounce Holmes byname. His own ideal was the<br>detective-inspector who catches criminals not because he is<br>intellectually brilliant but because he is part of an all-powerful<br>organi--zation. Hence the curious fact that in Wallace's most<br>characteristic stories the 'clue' and the 'deduction' play no part. The<br>criminal is always defeated by an incredible coincidence, or because in<br>some unexplained manner the police know all about the crime beforehand.<br>The tone of the stories makes it quite clear that Wallace's admiration<br>for the police is pure bully-worship. A Scotland Yard detective is the<br>most powerful kind of being that he can imagine, while the criminal<br>figures in his mind as an outlaw against whom anything is permissible,<br>like the condemned slaves in the Roman arena. His policemen behave much<br>more brutally than British policemen do in real life--they hit people<br>with out provocation, fire revolvers past their ears to terrify them and<br>so on--and some of the stories exhibit a fearful intellectual sadism.<br>(For instance, Wallace likes to arrange things so that the villain is<br>hanged on the same day as the heroine is married.) But it is sadism after<br>the English fashion: that is to say, it is unconscious, there is not<br>overtly any sex in it, and it keeps within the bounds of the law. The<br>British public tolerates a harsh criminal law and gets a kick out of<br>monstrously unfair murder trials: but still that is better, on any<br>account, than tolerating or admiring crime. If one must worship a bully,<br>it is better that he should be a policeman than a gangster. Wallace is<br>still governed to some extent by the concept of 'not done.' In NO ORCHIDS<br>anything is 'done' so long as it leads on to power. All the barriers are<br>down, all the motives are out in the open. Chase is a worse symptom than<br>Wallace, to the extent that all-in wrestling is worse than boxing, or<br>Fascism is worse than capitalist democracy.<br><br>In borrowing from William Faulkner's SANCTUARY, Chase only took the plot;<br>the mental atmosphere of the two books is not similar. Chase really<br>derives from other sources, and this particular bit of borrowing is only<br>symbolic. What it symbolizes is the vulgarization of ideas which is<br>constantly happening, and which probably happens faster in an age of<br>print. Chase has been described as 'Faulkner for the masses', but it<br>would be more accurate to describe him as Carlyle for the masses. He is a<br>popular writer--there are many such in America, but they are still<br>rarities in England--who has caught up with what is now fashionable to<br>call 'realism', meaning the doctrine that might is right. The growth of<br>'realism' has been the great feature of the intellectual history of our<br>own age. Why this should be so is a complicated question. The<br>interconnexion between sadism, masochism, success-worship, power-worship,<br>nationalism, and totalitarianism is a huge subject whose edges have<br>barely been scratched, and even to mention it is considered somewhat<br>indelicate. To take merely the first example that comes to mind, I<br>believe no one has ever pointed out the sadistic and masochistic element<br>in Bernard Shaw's work, still less suggested that this probably has some<br>connexion with Shaw's admiration for dictators. Fascism is often loosely<br>equated with sadism, but nearly always by people who see nothing wrong in<br>the most slavish worship of Stalin. The truth is, of course, that the<br>countless English intellectuals who kiss the arse of Stalin are not<br>different from the minority who give their allegiance to Hitler or<br>Mussolini, nor from the efficiency experts who preached 'punch', 'drive',<br>'personality' and 'learn to be a Tiger man' in the nineteen-twenties, nor<br>from that older generation of intellectuals, Carlyle, Creasey and the<br>rest of them, who bowed down before German militarism. All of them are<br>worshipping power and successful cruelty. It is important to notice that<br>the cult of power tends to be mixed up with a love of cruelty and<br>wickedness FOR THEIR OWN SAKES. A tyrant is all the more admired if he<br>happens to be a bloodstained crook as well, and 'the end justifies the<br>means' often becomes, in effect, 'the means justify themselves provided<br>they are dirty enough'. This idea colours the outlook of all sympathizers<br>with totalitarianism, and accounts, for instance, for the positive<br>delight with which many English intellectuals greeted the Nazi-Soviet<br>pact. It was a step only doubtfully useful to the U.S.S.R., but it was<br>entirely unmoral, and for that reason to be admired; the explanations of<br>it, which were numerous and self-contradictory, could come afterwards.<br><br>Until recently the characteristic adventure stories of the<br>English-speaking peoples have been stories in which the hero fights<br>AGAINST ODDS. This is true all the way from Robin Hood to Pop-eye the<br>Sailor. Perhaps the basic myth of the Western world is Jack the<br>Giant-killer, but to be brought up to date this should be renamed Jack<br>the Dwarf-killer, and there already exists a considerable literature<br>which teaches, either overtly or implicitly, that one should side with<br>the big man against the little man. Most of what is now written about<br>foreign policy is simply an embroidery on this theme, and for several<br>decades such phrases as 'Play the game', 'Don't hit a man when he's down'<br>and 'It's not cricket' have never failed to draw a snigger from anyone of<br>intellectual pretensions. What is comparatively new is to find the<br>accepted pattern, according to which (a) right is right and wrong is<br>wrong, whoever wins, and (b) weakness must be respected, disappearing<br>from popular literature as well. When I first read D. H. Lawrence's<br>novels, at the age of about twenty, I was puzzled by the fact that there<br>did not seem to be any classification of the characters into 'good' and<br>'bad'. Lawrence seemed to sympathize with all of them about equally, and<br>this was so unusual as to give me the feeling of having lost my bearings.<br>Today no one would think of looking for heroes and villains in a serious<br>novel, but in lowbrow fiction one still expects to find a sharp<br>distinction between right and wrong and between legality and illegality.<br>The common people, on the whole, are still living in the world of<br>absolute good and evil from which the intellectuals have long since<br>escaped. But the popularity of NO ORCHIDS and the American books and<br>magazines to which it is akin shows how rapidly the doctrine of 'realism'<br>is gaining ground.<br><br>Several people, after reading NO ORCHIDS, have remarked to me, 'It's pure<br>Fascism'. This is a correct description, although the book has not the<br>smallest connexion with politics and very little with social or economic<br>problems. It has merely the same relation to Fascism as, say Trollope's<br>novels have to nineteenth-century capitalism. It is a daydream<br>appropriate to a totalitarian age. In his imagined world of gangsters<br>Chase is presenting, as it were, a distilled version of the modern<br>political scene, in which such things as mass bombing of civilians, the<br>use of hostages, torture to obtain confessions, secret prisons, execution<br>without trial, floggings with rubber truncheons, drownings in cesspools,<br>systematic falsification of records and statistics, treachery, bribery,<br>and quislingism are normal and morally neutral, even admirable when they<br>are done in a large and bold way. The average man is not directly<br>interested in politics, and when he reads, he wants the current struggles<br>of the world to be translated into a simple story about individuals. He<br>can take an interest in Slim and Fenner as he could not in the G.P.U. and<br>the Gestapo. People worship power in the form in which they are able to<br>understand it. A twelve-year-old boy worships Jack Dempsey. An adolescent<br>in a Glasgow slum worships Al Capone. An aspiring pupil at a business<br>college worships Lord Nuffield. A NEW STATESMAN reader worships Stalin.<br>There is a difference in intellectual maturity, but none in moral<br>outlook. Thirty years ago the heroes of popular fiction had nothing in<br>common with Mr. Chase's gangsters and detectives, and the idols of the<br>English liberal intelligentsia were also comparatively sympathetic<br>figures. Between Holmes and Fenner on the one hand, and between Abraham<br>Lincoln and Stalin on the other, there is a similar gulf.<br><br>One ought not to infer too much from the success of Mr. Chase's books. It<br>is possible that it is an isolated phenomenon, brought about by the<br>mingled boredom and brutality of war. But if such books should definitely<br>acclimatize themselves in England, instead of being merely a<br>half-understood import from America, there would be good grounds for<br>dismay. In choosing RAFFLES as a background for NO ORCHIDS I deliberately<br>chose a book which by the standards of its time was morally equivocal.<br>Raffles, as I have pointed out, has no real moral code, no religion,<br>certainly no social consciousness. All he has is a set of reflexes the<br>nervous system, as it were, of a gentleman. Give him a sharp tap on this<br>reflex or that (they are called 'sport', 'pal', 'woman', 'king and<br>country' and so forth), and you get a predictable reaction. In Mr.<br>Chase's books there are no gentlemen and no taboos. Emancipation is<br>complete. Freud and Machiavelli have reached the outer suburbs. Comparing<br>the schoolboy atmosphere of the one book with the cruelty and corruption<br>of the other, one is driven to feel that snobbishness, like hypocrisy, is<br>a check upon behaviour whose value from a social point of view has been<br>underrated.<br><br></font></p>
