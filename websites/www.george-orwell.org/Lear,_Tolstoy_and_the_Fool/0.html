<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Tolstoy's pamphlets are the least-known part of his work, and his attack<br>on Shakespeare [Note, below] is not even an easy document to get hold of,<br>at any rate in an English translation. Perhaps, therefore, it will be<br>useful if I give a summary of the pamphlet before trying to discuss it.<br><br><br>[Note: SHAKESPEARE AND THE DRAMA. Written about 1903 as an introduction to<br>another pamphlet, SHAKESPEARE AND THE WORKING CLASSES, by Ernest Crosby.<br>(Author's footnote)]<br><br><br>Tolstoy begins by saying that throughout life Shakespeare has aroused in<br>him "an irresistible repulsion and tedium". Conscious that the opinion of<br>the civilized world is against him, he has made one attempt after another<br>on Shakespeare's works, reading and re-reading them in Russian, English<br>and German; but "I invariably underwent the same feelings; repulsion,<br>weariness and bewilderment". Now, at the age of seventy-five, he has once<br>again re-read the entire works of Shakespeare, including the historical<br>plays, and<br><br><br>I have felt with an even greater force, the same feelings--this time,<br>however, not of bewilderment, but of firm, indubitable conviction that<br>the unquestionable glory of a great genius which Shakespeare enjoys, and<br>which compels writers of our time to imitate him and readers and<br>spectators to discover in him non-existent merits--thereby distorting<br>their aesthetic and ethical understanding--is a great evil, as is every<br>untruth.<br><br><br>Shakespeare, Tolstoy adds, is not merely no genius, but is not even "an<br>average author", and in order to demonstrate this fact he will examine<br>KING LEAR, which, as he is able to show by quotations from Hazlitt,<br>Brandes and others, has been extravagantly praised and can be taken as an<br>example of Shakespeare's best work.<br><br>Tolstoy then makes a sort of exposition of the plot of KING LEAR, finding<br>it at every step to be stupid, verbose, unnatural, unintelligible,<br>bombastic, vulgar, tedious and full of incredible events, "wild ravings",<br>"mirthless jokes", anachronisms, irrelevaricies, obscenities, worn-out<br>stage conventions and other faults both moral and aesthetic. LEAR is, in<br>any case, a plagiarism of an earlier and much better play, KING LEIR, by<br>an unknown author, which Shakespeare stole and then ruined. It is worth<br>quoting a specimen paragraph to illustrate the manner in which Tolstoy<br>goes to work. Act III, Scene 2 (in which Lear, Kent and the Fool are<br>together in the storm) is summarized thus:<br><br><br>Lear walks about the heath and says word which are meant to express his<br>despair: he desires that the winds should blow so hard that they (the<br>winds) should crack their cheeks and that the rain should fiood<br>everything, that lightning should singe his white bead, and the thunder<br>flatten the world and destroy all germs "that make ungrateful man"! The<br>fool keeps uttering still more senseless words. Enter Kent: Lear says<br>that for some reason during this storm all criminals shall be found out<br>and convicted. Kent, still unrecognized by Lear, endeavours to persuade<br>him to take refuge in a hovel. At this point the fool utters a prophecy<br>in no wise related to the situation and they all depart.<br><br><br>Tolstoy's final verdict on LEAR is that no unhypnotized observer, if such<br>an observer existed, could read it to the end with any feeling except<br>"aversion and weariness". And exactly the same is true of "all the other<br>extolled dramas of Shakespeare, not to mention the senseless dramatized<br>tales, PERICLES, TWELFTH NIGHT, THE TEMPEST, CYMBELINE, TROILUS AND<br>CRESSIDA."<br><br>Having dealt with Lear Tolstoy draws up a more general indictment against<br>Shakespeare. He finds that Shakespeare has a certain technical skill<br>which is partly traceable to his having been an actor, but otherwise no<br>merits whatever. He has no power of delineating character or of making<br>words, and actions spring naturally out of situations, Us language is<br>uniformly exaggerated and ridiculous, he constantly thrusts his own<br>random thoughts into the mouth of any character who happens to be handy,<br>he displays a "complete absence of aesthetic feeling", and his words<br>"have nothing whatever in common with art and poetry".<br><br>"Shakespeare might have been whatever you like," Tolstoy concludes, "but<br>he was not an artist." Moreover, his opinions are not original or<br>interesting, and his tendency is "of the lowest and most immoral".<br>Curiously enough, Tolstoy does not base this last judgement on<br>Shakespeare's own utterances, but on the statements of two critics,<br>Gervinus and Brandes. According to Gervinus (or at any, rate Tolstoy's<br>reading of Gervinus) "Shakespeare taught. . . THAT ONE MAY BE TOO GOOD",<br>while according to Brandes: "Shakespeare's fundamental principle. . . is<br>that THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS." Tolstoy adds on his own account that<br>Shakespeare was a jingo patriot of the worst type, but apart from this he<br>considers that Gervinus and Brandes have given a true and adequate<br>description of Shakespeare's view of life.<br><br>Tolstoy then recapitulates in a few paragraphs the theory of art which he<br>had expressed at greater length elsewhere. Put still more shortly, it<br>amounts to a demand for dignity of subject matter, sincerity, and good<br>craftsmanships. A great work of art must deal with some subject which is<br>"important to the life of mankind", it must express someting which the<br>author genuinely feels, and it must use such technical methods as will<br>produce the desired effect. As Shakespeare is debased in outlook,<br>slipshod in execution and incapable of being sincere even for a moment,<br>he obviously stands condemned.<br><br>But here there arises a difficult question. If Shakespeare is all that<br>Tolstoy has shown him to be, how did he ever come to be so generally<br>admired? Evidently the answer can only lie in a sort of mass hypnosis, or<br>"epidemic suggestion". The whole civilized world has somehow been deluded<br>into thinking Shakespeare a good writer, and even the plainest<br>demonstration to the contrary makes no impression, because one is not<br>dealing with a reasoned opinion but with something akin to religious<br>faith. Throughout history, says Tolstoy, there has been an endless series<br>of these "epidemic suggestions"--for example, the Crusades, the search<br>for the Philosopher's Stone, the craze for tulip growing which once swept<br>over Holland, and so on and so forth. As a contemporary instance he<br>cites, rather significantly, the Dreyfus case, over which the whole world<br>grew violently excited for no sufficient reason. There are also sudden<br>short-lived crazes for new political and philosophical theories, or for<br>this or that writer, artist or scientist--for example, Darwin who (in<br>1903) is "beginning to be forgotten". And in some cases a quite worthless<br>popular idol may remain in favour for centuries, for "it also happens<br>that such crazes, having arisen in consequence of special reasons<br>accidentally favouring their establishment correspond in such a degree to<br>the views of life spread in society, and especially in literary circles,<br>that they are maintained for a long time". Shakespeare's plays have<br>continued to be admired over a long period because "they corresponded to<br>the irreligious and unmoral frame of mind of the upper classes of his<br>time and ours".<br><br>As to the manner in which Shakespeare's fame STARTED, Tolstoy explains it<br>as having been "got up" by German professors towards the end of the<br>eighteenth century. His reputation "originated in Germany, and thence was<br>transferred to England". The Germans chose to elevate Shakespeare<br>because, at a time when there was no German drama worth speaking about<br>and French classical literature was beginning to seem frigid and<br>artificial, they were captivated by Shakespeare's "clever development of<br>scenes" and also found in him a good expression of their own attitude<br>towards life. Goethe pronounced Shakespeare a great poet, whereupon all<br>the other critics flocked after him like a troop of parrots, and the<br>general infatuation has lasted ever since. The result has been a further<br>debasement of the drama--Tolstoy is careful to include his own plays<br>when condemning the contemporary stage--and a further corruption of the<br>prevailing moral outlook. It follows that "the false glorification of<br>Shakespeare" is an important evil which Tolstoy feels it his duty to<br>combat.<br><br>This, then, is the substance of Tolstoy's pamphlet. One's first feeling<br>is that in describing Shakespeare as a bad writer he is saying something<br>demonstrably untrue. But this is not the case. In reality there is no<br>kind of evidence or argument by which one can show that Shakespeare, or<br>any other writer, is "good". Nor is there any way of definitely proving<br>that--for instance--Warwick Beeping is "bad". Ultimately there is no<br>test of literary merit except survival, which is itself an index to<br>majority opinion. Artistic theories such as Tolstoy's are quite<br>worthless, because they not only start out with arbitrary assumptions,<br>but depend on vague terms ("sincere", "important" and so forth) which can<br>be interpreted in any way one chooses. Properly speaking one cannot<br>ANSWER Tolstoy's attack. The interesting question is: why did he make it?<br>But it should be noticed in passing that he uses many weak or dishonest<br>arguments. Some of these are worth pointing out, not because they<br>invalidate his main charge but because they are, so to speak, evidence of<br>malice.<br><br>To begin with, his examination of KING LEAR is not "impartial", as he<br>twice claims. On the contrary, it is a prolonged exercise in<br>misrepresentation. It is obvious that when you are summarizing KING LEAR<br>for the benefit of someone who has not read it, you are not really being<br>impartial if you introduce an important speech (Lear's speech when<br>Cordelia is dead in his arms) in this manner: "Again begin Lear's awful<br>ravings, at which one feels ashamed, as at unsuccessful jokes." And in a<br>long series of instances Tolstoy slightly alters or colours the passages<br>he is criticizing, always in such a way as to make the plot appear a<br>little more complicated and improbable, or the language a little more<br>exaggerated. For example, we are told that Lear "has no necessity or<br>motive for his abdication", although his reason for abdicating (that he<br>is old and wishes to retire from the cares of state) has been clearly<br>indicated in the first scene. It will be seen that even in the passage<br>which I quoted earlier, Tolstoy has wilfully misunderstood one phrase and<br>Slightly changed this meaning of another, making nonsense of a remark<br>which is reasonable enough in its context. None of these misreadings is<br>very gross in itself, but their cumulative effect is to exaggerate the<br>psychological incoherence of the play. Again, Tolstoy is not able to<br>explain why Shakespeare's plays were still in print, and still on the<br>stage, two hundred years after his death (BEFORE the "epidemic<br>suggestion" started, that is); and his whole account of Shakespeare's<br>rise to fame is guesswork punctuated by outright misstatements. And<br>again, various of his accusations contradict one another: for example,<br>Shakespeare is a mere entertainer and "not in earnest", but on the other<br>hand he is constantly putting his own thoughts into the mouths of his<br>characters. On the whole it is difficult to feel that Tolstoy's<br>criticisms are uttered in good faith. In any case it is impossible that<br>he should fully have believed in his main thesis--believed, that is to<br>say, that for a century or more the entire civilized world had been taken<br>in by a huge and palpable lie which he alone was able to see through.<br>Certainly his dislike of Shakespeare is real enough, but the reasons for<br>it may be different, or partly different, from what he avows; and therein<br>lies the interest of his pamphlet.<br><br>At this point one is obliged to start guessing. However, there is one<br>possible clue, or at least there is a question which may point the way to<br>a clue. It is: why did Tolstoy, with thirty or more plays to choose from,<br>pick out KING LEAR as his especial target? True, LEAR is so well known<br>and has beeen so much praised that it could justly be taken as<br>representative of Shakespeare's best work; still, for the purpose of a<br>hostile analysis Tolstoy would probably choose the play he disliked most.<br>Is it not possible that he bore an especial enmity towards this<br>particular play because he was aware, consciously or unconsciously, of<br>the resemblance between Lear's story and his own? But it is better to<br>approach this clue from the opposite direction--that is, by examining<br>LEAR itself, and the qualities in it that Tolstoy fails to mention.<br><br>One of the first things an English reader would notice in Tolstoy's<br>pamphlet is that it hardly deals with Shakespeare as a poet. Shakespeare<br>is treated as a dramatist, and in so far as his popularity is not<br>spurious, it is held to be due to tricks of stagecraft which give good<br>opportunities to clever actors. Now, so far as the English-speaking<br>countries go, this is not true; Several of the plays which are most<br>valued by lovers of Shakespeare (for instance, TIMON OF ATHENS) are<br>seldom or never acted, while some of the most actable, such as<br>A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, are the least admired. Those who care most for<br>Shakespeare value him in the first place for his use of language, the<br>"verbal music" which even Bernard Shaw, another hostile critic, admits to<br>be "irresistible". Tolstoy ignores this, and does not seem to realize<br>that a poem may have a special value for those who speak the language in<br>which it was written. However, even if one puts oneself in Tolstoy's<br>place and tries to think of Shakespeare as a foreign poet it is still<br>clear that there is something that Tolstoy has left out. Poetry, it<br>seems, is NOT solely a matter of sound and association, and valueless<br>outside its own language-group: otherwise how is it that some poems,<br>including poems written in dead languages, succeed in crossing frontiers?<br>Clearly a lyric like "To-morrow is Saint Valentine's Day" could not be<br>satisfactorily translated, but in Shakespeare's major work there is<br>something describable as poetry that can be separated from the words.<br>Tolstoy is right in saying that LEAR is not a very good play, as a play.<br>It is too drawn-out and has too many characters and sub-plots. One wicked<br>daughter would have been quite enough, and Edgar is a superfluous<br>character: indeed it would probably be a better play if Gloucester and<br>both his sons were eliminated. Nevertheless, something, a kind of<br>pattern, or perhaps only an atmosphere, survives the complications and<br>the LONGUEURS. LEAR can be imagined as a puppet show, a mime, a ballet, a<br>series of pictures. Part of its poetry, perhaps the most essential part,<br>is inherent in the story and is dependent neither on any particular set<br>of words, nor on flesh-and-blood presentation.<br><br>Shut your eyes and think of KING LEAR, if possible without calling to<br>mind any of the dialogue. What do you see? Here at any rate is what I<br>see; a majestic old man in a long black robe, with flowing white hair and<br>beard, a figure out of Blake's drawings (but also, curiously enough,<br>rather like Tolstoy), wandering through a storm and cursing the heavens,<br>in company with a Fool and a lunatic. Presently the scene shifts and the<br>old man, still cursing, still understanding nothing, is holding a dead<br>girl in his arms while the Fool dangles on a gallows somewhere in the<br>background. This is the bare skeleton of the play, and even here Tolstoy<br>wants to cut out most of what is essential. He objects to the storm, as<br>being unnecessary, to the Fool, who in his eyes is simply a tedious<br>nuisance and an excuse for making bad jokes, and to the death of<br>Cordelia, which, as he sees it, robs the play of its moral. According to<br>Tolstoy, the earlier play. KING LEIR, which Shakespeare adapted<br><br><br>terminates more naturally and more in accordance with the moral demands<br>of the spectator than does Shakespeare's; namely, by the King of the<br>Gauls conquering the husbands of the elder sisters, and by Cordelia,<br>instead of being killed, restoring Leir to his former position.<br><br><br>In other words the tragedy ought to have been a comedy, or perhaps a<br>melodrama. It is doubtful whether the sense of tragedy is compatible with<br>belief in God: at any rate, it is not compatible with disbelief in human<br>dignity and with the kind of "moral demand" which feels cheated when<br>virtue fails to triumph. A tragic situation exists precisely when virtue<br>does NOT triumph but when it is still felt that man is nobler than the<br>forces which destroy him. It is perhaps more significant that Tolstoy<br>sees no justification for the presence of the Fool. The Fool is integral<br>to the play. He acts not only as a sort of chorus, making the central<br>situation clearer by commenting on it more intelligently than the other<br>characters, but as a foil to Lear's frenzies. His jokes, riddles and<br>scraps of rhyme, and his endless digs at Lear's high-minded folly,<br>ranging from mere derision to a sort of melancholy poetry ("All thy other<br>titles thou hast given away, that thou wast born with"), are like a<br>trickle of sanity running through the play, a reminder that somewhere or<br>other in spite of the injustices, cruelties, intrigues, deceptions and<br>misunderstandings that are being enacted here, life is going on much as<br>usual. In Tolstoy's impatience with the Fool one gets a glimpse of his<br>deeper quarrel with Shakespeare. He objects, with some justification, to<br>the raggedness of Shakespeare's plays, the irrelevancies, the incredible<br>plots, the exaggerated language: but what at bottom he probably most<br>dislikes is a sort of exuberance, a tendency to take--not so much a<br>pleasure as simply an interest in the actual process of life. It is a<br>mistake to write Tolstoy off as a moralist attacking an artist. He never<br>said that art, as such, is wicked or meaningless, nor did he even say<br>that technical virtuosity is unimportant. But his main aim, in his later<br>years, was to narrow the range of human consciousness. One's interests,<br>one's points of attachment to the physical world and the day-to-day<br>struggle, must be as few and not as many as possible. Literature must<br>consist of parables, stripped of detail and almost independent of<br>language. The parables--this is where Tolstoy differs from the average<br>vulgar puritan--must themselves be works of art, but pleasure and<br>curiosity must be excluded from them. Science, also, must be divorced<br>from curiosity. The business of science, he says, is not to discover what<br>happens but to teach men how they ought to live. So also with history and<br>politics. Many problems (for example, the Dreyfus case) are simply not<br>worth solving, and he is willing to leave them as loose ends. Indeed his<br>whole theory of "crazes" or "epidemic suggestions", in which he lumps<br>together such things as the Crusades and the Dutch passion of tulip<br>growing, shows a willingness to regard many human activities as mere<br>ant-like rushings to and fro, inexplicable and uninteresting. Clearly he<br>could have no patience with a chaotic, detailed, discursive writer like<br>Shakespeare. His reaction is that of an irritable old man who is being<br>pestered by a noisy child. "Why do you keep jumping up and down like<br>that? Why can't you sit still like I do?" In a way the old man is in the<br>right, but the trouble is that the child, has a feeling in its limbs<br>which the old man has lost. And if the old man knows of the existence of<br>this feeling, the effect is merely to increase his irritation: he would<br>make children senile, if he could. Tolstoy does not know, perhaps, just<br>WHAT he misses in Shakespeare, but he is aware that he misses something,<br>and he is determined that others shall be deprived of it as well. By<br>nature he was imperious as well as egotistical. Well after he was grown<br>up he would still occasionally strike his servant in moments of anger,<br>and somewhat later, according to his English biographer, Derrick Leon, he<br>felt "a frequent desire upon the slenderest provocation to slap the faces<br>of those with whom he disagreed". One docs not necessarily get rid of<br>that kind of temperament by undergoing religious conversion, and indeed<br>it is obvious that the illusion of having been reborn may allow one's<br>native vices to flourish more freely than ever, though perhaps in subtler<br>forms. Tolstoy was capable of abjuring physical violence and of seeing<br>what this implies, but he was not capable of tolerance or humility, and<br>even if one knew nothing of his other writings, one could deduce his<br>tendency towards spiritual bullying from this single pamphlet.<br><br>However, Tolstoy is not simply trying to rob others of a pleasure he does<br>not share. He is doing that, but his quarrel with Shakespeare goes<br>further. It is the quarrel between the religious and the humanist<br>attitudes towards life. Here one comes back to the central theme of KING<br>LEAR, which Tolstoy does not mention, although he sets forth the plot in<br>some detail.<br><br>Lear is one of the minority of Shakespeare's plays that are unmistakably<br>ABOUT something. As Tolstoy justly complains, much rubbish has been<br>written about Shakespeare as a philosopher, as a psychologist, as a<br>"great moral teacher", and what-not. Shakespeare was not a systematic<br>thinker, his most serious thoughts are uttered irrelevantly or<br>indirectly, and we do not know to what extent he wrote with a "purpose"<br>or even how much of the work attributed to him was actually written by<br>him. In the sonnets he never even refers to the plays as part of his<br>achievement, though he does make what seems to be a half-ashamed allusion<br>to his career as an actor. It is perfectly possible that he looked on at<br>least half of his plays as mere pot-boilers and hardly bothered about<br>purpose or probability so long as he could patch up something, usually<br>from stolen material, which would more or less hang together on the<br>stage. However, that is not the whole story. To begin with, as Tolstoy<br>himself points out, Shakespeare has a habit of thrusting uncalled-for<br>general reflections into the mouths of his characters. This is a serious<br>fault in a dramatist, but it does not fit in with Tolstoy's picture of<br>Shakespeare as a vulgar hack who has no opinions of his own and merely<br>wishes to produce the greatest effect with the least trouble. And more<br>than this, about a dozen of his plays, written for the most part later<br>than 1600, do unquestionably have a meaning and even a moral. They<br>revolve round a central subject which in some cases can be reduced to a<br>single word. For example, MACBETH is about ambition, Othello is about<br>jealousy, and TIMON OF ATHENS is about money. The subject of LEAR is<br>renunciation, and it is only by being wilfully blind that one can fail to<br>understand what Shakespeare is saying.<br><br>Lear renounces his throne but expects everyone to continue treating him<br>as a king. He does not see that if he surrenders power, other people will<br>take advantage of his weakness: also that those who flatter him the most<br>grossly, i.e. Regan and Goneril, are exactly the ones who will turn<br>against him. The moment he finds that he can no longer make people obey<br>him as he did before, he falls into a rage which Tolstoy describes as<br>"strange and unnatural", but which in fact is perfectly in character. In<br>his madness and despair, he passes through two moods which again are<br>natural enough in his circumstances, though in one of them it is probable<br>that he is being used partly as a mouthpiece for Shakespeare's own<br>opinions. One is the mood of disgust in which Lear repents, as it were,<br>for having been a king, and grasps for the first time the rottenness of<br>formal justice and vulgar morality. The other is a mood of impotent fury<br>in which he wreaks imaginary revenges upon those who have wronged him.<br>"To have a thousand with red burning spits come hissing in upon 'em!",<br>and:<br><br>It were a delicate stratagem to shoe<br>A troop of horse with felt; I'll put't in proof;<br>And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,<br>Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!<br><br>Only at the end does he realize, as a sane man, that power, revenge and<br>victory are not worth while:<br><br>No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison. . .<br>. . . . . . . . and we'll wear out,<br>In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones<br>That ebb and flow by the moon.<br><br>But by the time he makes this discovery it is too late, for his death and<br>Cordelia's are already decided on. That is the story, and, allowing for<br>some clumsiness in the telling, it is a very good story.<br><br>But is it not also curiously similar to the history of Tolstoy himself?<br>There is a general resemblance which one can hardly avoid seeing, because<br>the most impressive event in Tolstoy's life, as in Lear's, was a huge and<br>gratuitous act of renunciation. In his old age, he renounced his estate,<br>his title and his copyrights, and made an attempt--a sincere attempt,<br>though it was not successful--to escape from his privileged position and<br>live the life of a peasant. But the deeper resemblance lies in the fact<br>that Tolstoy, like Lear, acted on mistaken motives and failed to get the<br>results he had hoped for. According to Tolstoy, the aim of every human<br>being is happiness, and happiness can only be attained by doing the will<br>of God. But doing the will of God means casting off all earthly pleasures<br>and ambitions, and living only for others. Ultimately, therefore, Tolstoy<br>renounced the world under the expectation that this would make him<br>happier. But if there is one thing certain about his later years, it is<br>that he was NOT happy. On the contraty he was driven almost to the edge<br>of madness by the behaviour of the people about him, who persecuted him<br>precisely BECAUSE of his renunciation. Like Lear, Tolstoy was not humble<br>and not a good judge of character. He was inclined at moments to revert<br>to the attitudes of an aristocrat, in spite of his peasant's blouse, and<br>he even had two children whom he had believed in and who ultimately<br>turned against him--though, of course, in a less sensational manner than<br>Regan and Goneril. His exaggerated revulsion from sexuality was also<br>distinctly similar to Lear's. Tolstoy's remark that marriage is "slavery,<br>satiety, repulsion" and means putting up with the proximity of "ugliness,<br>dirtiness, smell, sores", is matched by Lear's well-known outburst:<br><br>But to the girdle do the gods inherit,<br>Beneath is all the fiends;<br>There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit,<br>Burning, scalding, stench, consumption, etc., etc.<br><br>And though Tolstoy could not foresee it when he wrote his essay on<br>Shakespeare, even the ending of his life--the sudden unplanned flight<br>across country, accompanied only by a faithful daughter, the death in a<br>cottage in a strange village--seems to have in it a sort of phantom<br>reminiscence of LEAR.<br><br>Of course, one cannot assume that Tolstoy was aware of this resemblance,<br>or would have admitted it if it had been pointed out to him. But his<br>attitude towards the play must have been influenced by its theme.<br>Renouncing power, giving away your lands, was a subject on which he had<br>reason to feel deeply; Probably, therefore, he would be more angered and<br>disturbed by the moral that Shakespeare draws than he would be in the<br>case of some other play--MACBETH, for example--which did not touch so<br>closely on his own life. But what exactly is the moral of LEAR? Evidently<br>there are two morals, one explicit, the other implied in the story.<br><br>Shakespeare starts by assuming that to make yourself powerless is to<br>invite an attack. This does not mean that EVERYONE will turn against you<br>(Kent and the Fool stand by Lear from first to last), but in all<br>probability SOMEONE will. If you throw away your weapons, some less<br>scrupulous person will pick them up. If you turn the other cheek, you<br>will get a harder blow on it than you got on the first one. This docs not<br>always happen, but it is to be expected, and you ought not to complain if<br>it does happen. The second blow is, so to speak, part of the act of<br>turning the other cheek. First of all, therefore, there is the vulgar,<br>common-sense moral drawn by the Fool: "Don't relinquish power, don't give<br>away your lands." But there is also another moral. Shakespeare never<br>utters it in so many words, and it does not very much matter whether he<br>was fully aware of it. It is contained in the story, which, after all, he<br>made up, or altered to suit his purposes. It is: "Give away your lands if<br>you want to, but don't expect to gain happiness by doing so. Probably you<br>won't gain happiness. If you live for others, you must live FOR OTHERS,<br>and not as a roundabout way of getting an advantage for yourself."<br><br>Obviously neither of these conclusions could have been pleasing to<br>Tolstoy. The first of them expresses the ordinary, belly-to-earth<br>selfishness from which he was genuinely trying to escape. The other<br>conflicts with his desire to eat his cake and have it--that is, to<br>destroy his own egoism and by so doing to gain eternal life. Of course,<br>LEAR is not a sermon in favour of altruism. It merely points out the<br>results of practising self-denial for selfish reasons. Shakespeare had a<br>considerable streak of worldliness in him, and if he had been forced to<br>take sides in his own play, his sympathies would probably have lain with<br>the Fool. But at least he could see the whole issue and treat it at the<br>level of tragedy. Vice is punished, but virtue is not rewarded. The<br>morality of Shakespeare's later tragedies is not religious in the<br>ordinary sense, and certainly is not Christian. Only two of them, HAMLET<br>and OTHELLO, are supposedly occurring inside the Christian era, and even<br>in those, apart from the antics of the ghost in HAMLET, there is no<br>indication of a "next world" where everything is to be put right. All of<br>these tragedies start out with the humanist assumption that life,<br>although full of sorrow, is worth living, and that Man is a noble animal<br>--a belief which Tolstoy in his old age did not share.<br><br>Tolstoy was not a saint, but he tried very hard to make himself into a<br>saint, and the standards he applied to literature were other-worldly<br>ones. It is important to realize that the difference between a saint and<br>an ordinary human being is a difference of kind and not of degree. That<br>is, the one is not to be regarded as an imperfect form of the other. The<br>saint, at any rate Tolstoy's kind of saint, is not trying t6 work an<br>improvement in earthly life: he is trying to bring it to an end and put<br>something different in its place. One obvious expression of this is the<br>claim that celibacy is "higher" than marriage. If only, Tolstoy says in<br>effect, we would stop breeding, fighting, struggling and enjoying, if we<br>could get rid not only of our sins but of everything else that binds us<br>to the surface of the earth--including love, then the whole painful<br>process would be over and the Kingdom of Heaven would arrive. But a<br>normal human being does not want the Kingdom of Heaven: he wants life on<br>earth to continue. This is not solely because he is "weak", "sinful" and<br>anxious for a "good time". Most people get a fair amount of fun out of<br>their lives, but on balance life is suffering, and only the very young or<br>the very foolish imagine otherwise. Ultimately it is the Christian<br>attitude which is self-interested and hedonistic, since the aim is<br>always to get away from the painful struggle of earthly life and find<br>eternal peace in some kind of Heaven or Nirvana. The humanist attitude is<br>that the struggle must continue and that death is the price of life. "Men<br>must endure their going hence, even as their coming hither: Ripeness is<br>all"--which is an un-Christian sentiment. Often there is a seeming truce<br>between the humanist and the religious believer, but in fact their<br>attitudes cannot be reconciled: one must choose between this world and<br>the next. And the enormous majority of human beings, if they understood<br>the issue, would choose this world. They do make that choice when they<br>continue working, breeding and dying instead of crippling their faculties<br>in the hope of obtaining a new lease of existence elsewhere.<br><br>We do not know a great deal about Shakespeare's religious beliefs, and<br>from the evidence of his writings it would be difficult to prove that he<br>had any. But at any rate he was not a saint or a would-be saint: he was a<br>human being, and in some ways not a very good one. It is clear, for<br>instance, that he liked to stand well with the rich and powerful, and was<br>capable of flattering them in the most servile way. He is also noticeably<br>cautious, not to say cowardly, in his manner of uttering unpopular<br>opinions. Almost never does he put a subversive or sceptical remark into<br>the mouth of a character likely to be identified with himself. Throughout<br>his plays the acute social critics, the people who are not taken in by<br>accepted fallacies, are buffoons, villains, lunatics or persons who are<br>shamming insanity or are in a state of violent hysteria. LEAR is a play<br>in which this tendency is particularly well marked. It contains a great<br>deal of veiled social criticism--a point Tolstoy misses--but it is all<br>uttered either by the Fool, by Edgar when he is pretending to be mad, or<br>by Lear during his bouts of madness. In his sane moments Lear hardly ever<br>makes an intelligent remark. And yet the very fact that Shakespeare had<br>to use these subterfuges shows how widely his thoughts ranged. He could<br>not restrain himself from commenting on almost everything, although he<br>put on a series of masks in order to do so. If one has once read<br>Shakespeare with attention, it is not easy to go a day without quoting<br>him, because there are not many subjects of major importance that he does<br>not discuss or at least mention somewhere or other, in his unsystematic<br>but illuminating way. Even the irrelevancies that litter every one of his<br>plays--the puns and riddles, the lists of names, the scraps of<br>"reportage" like the conversation of the carriers in HENRY IV the bawdy<br>jokes, the rescued fragments of forgotten ballads--are merely the<br>products of excessive vitality. Shakespeare was not a philosopher or a<br>scientist, but he did have curiosity, he loved the surface of the earth<br>and the process of life--which, it should be repealed, is NOT the same<br>thing as wanting to have a good time and stay alive as long as possible.<br>Of course, it is not because of the quality of his thought that<br>Shakespeare has survived, and he might not even be remembered as a<br>dramatist if he had not also been a poet. His main hold on us is through<br>language. How deeply Shakespeare himself was fascinated by the music of<br>words can probably be inferred from the speeches of Pistol. What Pistol<br>says is largely meaningless, but if one considers his lines singly they<br>are magnificent rhetorical verse. Evidently, pieces of resounding<br>nonsense ("Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on", etc.) were<br>constantly appearing in Shakespeare's mind of their own accord, and a<br>half-lunatic character had to be invented to use them up.<br><br>Tolstoy's native tongue was not English, and one cannot blame him for<br>being unmoved by Shakespeare's verse, nor even, perhaps, for refusing to<br>believe that Shakespeare's skill with words was something out of the<br>ordinary. But he would also have rejected the whole notion of valuing<br>poetry for its texture--valuing it, that is to say, as a kind of music.<br>If it could somehow have been proved to him that his whole explanation of<br>Shakespeare's rise to fame is mistaken, that inside the English-speaking<br>world, at any rate, Shakespeare's popularity is genuine, that his mere<br>skill in placing one syllable beside another has given acute pleasure to<br>generation after generation of English-speaking people--all this would<br>not have been counted as a merit to Shakespeare, but rather the contrary.<br>It would simply have been one more proof of the irreligious, earthbound<br>nature of Shakespeare and his admirers. Tolstoy would have said that<br>poetry is to be judged by its meaning, and that seductive sounds merely<br>cause false meanings to go unnoticed. At every level it is the same<br>issue--this world against the next: and certainly the music of words is<br>something that belongs to this world.<br><br>A sort of doubt has always hung around the character of Tolstoy, as round<br>the character of Gandhi. He was not a vulgar hypocrite, as some people<br>declared him to be, and he would probably have imposed even greater<br>sacrifices on himself than he did, if he had not been interfered with at<br>every step by the people surrounding him, especially his wife. But on the<br>other hand it is dangerous to take such men as Tolstoy at their<br>disciples' valuation. There is always the possibility--the probability,<br>indeed--that they have done no more than exchange one form of egoism for<br>another. Tolstoy renounced wealth, fame and privilege; he abjured<br>violence in all its forms and was ready to suffer for doing so; but it is<br>not easy to believe that he abjured the principle of coercion, or at<br>least the DESIRE to coerce others. There are families in which the father<br>will say to his child, "You'll get a thick car if you do that again",<br>while the mother, her eyes brimming over with tears, will take the child<br>in her arms and murmur lovingly, "Now, darling, IS it kind to Mummy to do<br>that?" And who would maintain that the second method is less tyrannous<br>than the first? The distinction that really matters is not between<br>violence and non-violence, but between having and not having the appetite<br>for power. There are people who are convinced of the wickedness both of<br>armies and of police forces, but who are nevertheless much more<br>intolerant and inquisitorial in outlook than the normal person who<br>believes that it is necessary to use violence in certain circumstances.<br>They will not say to somebody else, "Do this, that and the other or you<br>will go to prison", but they will, if they can, get inside his brain and<br>dictate his thoughts for him in the minutest particulars. Creeds like<br>pacifism and anarchism, which seem on the surface to imply a complete<br>renunciation of power, rather encourage this habit of mind. For if you<br>have embraced a creed which appears to be free from the ordinary<br>dirtiness of politics--a creed from which you yourself cannot expect to<br>draw any material advantage--surely that proves that you are in the<br>right? And the more you are in the right, the more natural that everyone<br>else should be bullied into thinking likewise.<br><br>If we are to believe what he says in his pamphlet, Tolstoy has never been<br>able to see any merit in Shakespeare, and was always astonished to find<br>that his fellow-writers, Turgenev, Fet and others thought differently. We<br>may be sure that in his unregenerate days Tolstoy's conclusion would have<br>been: "You like Shakespeare--I don't. Let's leave it at that." Later,<br>when his perception that it takes all sorts to make a world had deserted<br>him, he came to think of Shakespeare's writings as something dangerous to<br>himself. The more pleasure people took in Shakespeare, the less they<br>would listen to Tolstoy. Therefore nobody must be ALLOWED to enjoy<br>Shakespeare, just as nobody must be allowed to drink alcohol or smoke<br>tobacco. True, Tolstoy would not prevent them by force. He is not<br>demanding that the police shall impound every copy of Shakespeare's<br>works. But he will do dirt on Shakespeare, if he can. He will try to get<br>inside the mind of every lover of Shakespeare and kill his enjoyment by<br>every trick he can think of, including--as I have shown in my summary of<br>his pamphlet--arguments which are self-contradictory or even doubtfully<br>honest.<br><br>But finally the most striking thing is how little difference it all<br>makes. As I said earlier, one cannot ANSWER Tolstoy's pamphlet, at least<br>on its main counts. There is no argument by which one can defend a poem.<br>It defends itself by surviving, or it is indefensible. And if this test<br>is valid, I think the verdict in Shakespeare's case must be "not guilty".<br>Like every other writer, Shakespeare will be forgotten sooner or later,<br>but it is unlikely that a heavier indictment will ever be brought against<br>him. Tolstoy was perhaps the most admired literary man of his age, and he<br>was certainly not its least able pamphleteer. He turned all his powers of<br>denunciation against Shakespeare, like all the guns of a battleship<br>roaring simultaneously. And with what result? Forty years later<br>Shakespeare is still there completely unaffected, and of the attempt to<br>demolish him nothing remains except the yellowing pages of a pamphlet<br>which hardly anyone has read, and which would be forgotten altogether if<br>Tolstoy had not also been the author of WAR AND PEACE and ANNA KARENINA.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font></p>
