<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Part I<br><br>England Your England<br><br>i<br><br>As I write, highly civilized human beings are flying overhead, trying to<br>kill me.<br><br>They do not feel any enmity against me as an individual, nor I against<br>them. They are 'only doing their duty', as the saying goes. Most of them,<br>I have no doubt, are kind-hearted law-abiding men who would never dream<br>of committing murder in private life. On the other hand, if one of them<br>succeeds in blowing me to pieces with a well-placed bomb, he will never<br>sleep any the worse for it. He is serving his country, which has the<br>power to absolve him from evil.<br><br>One cannot see the modern world as it is unless one recognizes the<br>overwhelming strength of patriotism, national loyalty. In certain<br>circumstances it can break down, at certain levels of civilization it<br>does not exist, but as a POSITIVE force there is nothing to set beside<br>it. Christianity and international Socialism are as weak as straw in<br>comparison with it. Hitler and Mussolini rose to power in their own<br>countries very largely because they could grasp this fact and their<br>opponents could not.<br><br>Also, one must admit that the divisions between nation and nation are<br>founded on real differences of outlook. Till recently it was thought<br>proper to pretend that all human beings are very much alike, but in fact<br>anyone able to use his eyes knows that the average of human behaviour<br>differs enormously from country to country. Things that could happen in<br>one country could not happen in another. Hitler's June purge, for<br>instance, could not have happened in England. And, as western peoples go,<br>the English are very highly differentiated. There is a sort of<br>back-handed admission of this in the dislike which nearly all foreigners<br>feel for our national way of life. Few Europeans can endure living in<br>England, and even Americans often feel more at home in Europe.<br><br>When you come back to England from any foreign country, you have<br>immediately the sensation of breathing a different air. Even in the first<br>few minutes dozens of small things conspire to give you this feeling. The<br>beer is bitterer, the coins are heavier, the grass is greener, the<br>advertisements are more blatant. The crowds in the big towns, with their<br>mild knobby faces, their bad teeth and gentle manners, are different from<br>a European crowd. Then the vastness of England swallows you up, and you<br>lose for a while your feeling that the whole nation has a single<br>identifiable character. Are there really such things as nations? Are we<br>not forty-six million individuals, all different? And the diversity of<br>it, the chaos! The clatter of clogs in the Lancashire mill towns, the<br>to-and-fro of the lorries on the Great North Road, the queues outside the<br>Labour Exchanges, the rattle of pin-tables in the Soho pubs, the old<br>maids hiking to Holy Communion through the mists of the autumn morning--<br>all these are not only fragments, but CHARACTERISTIC fragments, of the<br>English scene. How can one make a pattern out of this muddle?<br><br>But talk to foreigners, read foreign books or newspapers, and you are<br>brought back to the same thought. Yes, there is something distinctive and<br>recognizable in English civilization. It is a culture as individual as<br>that of Spain. It is somehow bound up with solid breakfasts and gloomy<br>Sundays, smoky towns and winding roads, green fields and red<br>pillar-boxes. It has a flavour of its own. Moreover it is continuous, it<br>stretches into the future and the past, there is something in it that<br>persists, as in a living creature. What can the England of 1940 have in<br>common with the England of 1840? But then, what have you in common with<br>the child of five whose photograph your mother keeps on the mantelpiece?<br>Nothing, except that you happen to be the same person.<br><br>And above all, it is YOUR civilization, it is you. However much you hate<br>it or laugh at it, you will never be happy away from it for any length of<br>time. The suet puddings and the red pillar-boxes have entered into your<br>soul. Good or evil, it is yours, you belong to it, and this side the<br>grave you will never get away from the marks that it has given you.<br><br>Meanwhile England, together with the rest of the world, is changing. And<br>like everything else it can change only in certain directions, which up<br>to a point can be foreseen. That is not to say that the future is fixed,<br>merely that certain alternatives are possible and others not. A seed may<br>grow or not grow, but at any rate a turnip seed never grows into a<br>parsnip. It is therefore of the deepest importance to try and determine<br>what England IS, before guessing what part England CAN PLAY in the huge<br>events that are happening.<br><br><br>ii<br><br><br>National characteristics are not easy to pin down, and when pinned down<br>they often turn out to be trivialities or seem to have no connexion with<br>one another. Spaniards are cruel to animals, Italians can do nothing<br>without making a deafening noise, the Chinese are addicted to gambling.<br>Obviously such things don't matter in themselves. Nevertheless, nothing<br>is causeless, and even the fact that Englishmen have bad teeth can tell<br>something about the realities of English life.<br><br>Here are a couple of generalizations about England that would be accepted<br>by almost all observers. One is that the English are not gifted<br>artistically. They are not as musical as the Germans or Italians,<br>painting and sculpture have never flourished in England as they have in<br>France. Another is that, as Europeans go, the English are not<br>intellectual. They have a horror of abstract thought, they feel no need<br>for any philosophy or systematic 'world-view'. Nor is this because they<br>are 'practical', as they are so fond of claiming for themselves. One has<br>only to look at their methods of town planning and water supply, their<br>obstinate clinging to everything that is out of date and a nuisance, a<br>spelling system that defies analysis, and a system of weights and<br>measures that is intelligible only to the compilers of arithmetic books,<br>to see how little they care about mere efficiency. But they have a<br>certain power of acting without taking thought. Their world-famed<br>hypocrisy--their double-faced attitude towards the Empire, for instance<br>--is bound up with this. Also, in moments of supreme crisis the whole<br>nation can suddenly draw together and act upon a species of instinct,<br>really a code of conduct which is understood by almost everyone, though<br>never formulated. The phrase that Hitler coined for the Germans, 'a<br>sleep-walking people', would have been better applied to the English. Not<br>that there is anything to be proud of in being called a sleep-walker.<br><br>But here it is worth noting a minor English trait which is extremely well<br>marked though not often commented on, and that is a love of flowers. This<br>is one of the first things that one notices when one reaches England from<br>abroad, especially if one is coming from southern Europe. Does it not<br>contradict the English indifference to the arts? Not really, because it<br>is found in people who have no aesthetic feelings whatever. What it does<br>link up with, however, is another English characteristic which is so much<br>a part of us that we barely notice it, and that is the addiction to<br>hobbies and spare-time occupations, the PRIVATENESS of English life. We<br>are a nation of flower-lovers, but also a nation of stamp-collectors,<br>pigeon-fanciers, amateur carpenters, coupon-snippers, darts-players,<br>crossword-puzzle fans. All the culture that is most truly native centres<br>round things which even when they are communal are not official--the<br>pub, the football match, the back garden, the fireside and the 'nice cup<br>of tea'. The liberty of the individual is still believed in, almost as in<br>the nineteenth century. But this has nothing to do with economic liberty,<br>the right to exploit others for profit. It is the liberty to have a home<br>of your own, to do what you like in your spare time, to choose your own<br>amusements instead of having them chosen for you from above. The most<br>hateful of all names in an English ear is Nosey Parker. It is obvious, of<br>course, that even this purely private liberty is a lost cause. Like all<br>other modern people, the English are in process of being numbered,<br>labelled, conscripted, 'co-ordinated'. But the pull of their impulses is<br>in the other direction, and the kind of regimentation that can be imposed<br>on them will be modified in consequence. No party rallies, no Youth<br>Movements, no coloured shirts, no Jew-baiting or 'spontaneous'<br>demonstrations. No Gestapo either, in all probability.<br><br>But in all societies the common people must live to some extent AGAINST<br>the existing order. The genuinely popular culture of England is something<br>that goes on beneath the surface, unofficially and more or less frowned<br>on by the authorities. One thing one notices if one looks directly at the<br>common people, especially in the big towns, is that they are not<br>puritanical. They are inveterate gamblers, drink as much beer as their<br>wages will permit, are devoted to bawdy jokes, and use probably the<br>foulest language in the world. They have to satisfy these tastes in the<br>face of astonishing, hypocritical laws (licensing laws, lottery acts,<br>etc. etc.) which are designed to interfere with everybody but in practice<br>allow everything to happen. Also, the common people are without definite<br>religious belief, and have been so for centuries. The Anglican Church<br>never had a real hold on them, it was simply a preserve of the landed<br>gentry, and the Nonconformist sects only influenced minorities. And yet<br>they have retained a deep tinge of Christian feeling, while almost<br>forgetting the name of Christ. The power-worship which is the new<br>religion of Europe, and which has infected the English intelligentsia,<br>has never touched the common people. They have never caught up with power<br>politics. The 'realism' which is preached in Japanese and Italian<br>newspapers would horrify them. One can learn a good deal about the spirit<br>of England from the comic coloured postcards that you see in the windows<br>of cheap stationers' shops. These things are a sort of diary upon which<br>the English people have unconsciously recorded themselves. Their<br>old-fashioned outlook, their graded snobberies, their mixture of<br>bawdiness and hypocrisy, their extreme gentleness, their deeply moral<br>attitude to life, are all mirrored there.<br><br>The gentleness of the English civilization is perhaps its most marked<br>characteristic. You notice it the instant you set foot on English soil.<br>It is a land where the bus conductors are good-tempered and the policemen<br>carry no revolvers. In no country inhabited by white men is it easier to<br>shove people off the pavement. And with this goes something that is<br>always written off by European observers as 'decadence' or hypocrisy, the<br>English hatred of war and militarism. It is rooted deep in history, and<br>it is strong in the lower-middle class as well as the working class.<br>Successive wars have shaken it but not destroyed it. Well within living<br>memory it was common for 'the redcoats' to be booed at in the streets and<br>for the landlords of respectable public houses to refuse to allow<br>soldiers on the premises. In peace time, even when there are two million<br>unemployed, it is difficult to fill the ranks of the tiny standing army,<br>which is officered by the country gentry and a specialized stratum of the<br>middle class, and manned by farm labourers and slum proletarians. The<br>mass of the people are without military knowledge or tradition, and their<br>attitude towards war is invariably defensive. No politician could rise to<br>power by promising them conquests or military 'glory', no Hymn of Hate<br>has ever made any appeal to them. In the last war the songs which the<br>soldiers made up and sang of their own accord were not vengeful but<br>humorous and mock-defeatist[Note, below]. The only enemy they ever named<br>was the sergeant-major.<br><br><br>[Note: For example:<br><br>'I don't want to join the bloody Army,<br>I don't want to go unto the war;<br>I want no more to roam,<br>I'd rather stay at home,<br>Living on the earnings of a whore.<br><br>But it was not in that spirit that they fought.<br>(Author'sfootnote.)]<br><br><br>In England all the boasting and flag-wagging, the 'Rule Britannia' stuff,<br>is done by small minorities. The patriotism of the common people is not<br>vocal or even conscious. They do not retain among their historical<br>memories the name of a single military victory. English literature, like<br>other literatures, is full of battle-poems, but it is worth noticing that<br>the ones that have won for themselves a kind of popularity are always a<br>tale of disasters and retreats. There is no popular poem about Trafalgar<br>or Waterloo, for instance. Sir John Moore's army at Corunna, fighting a<br>desperate rearguard action before escaping overseas (just like Dunkirk!)<br>has more appeal than a brilliant victory. The most stirring battle-poem<br>in English is about a brigade of cavalry which charged in the wrong<br>direction. And of the last war, the four names which have really engraved<br>themselves on the popular memory are Mons, Ypres, Gallipoli and<br>Passchendaele, every time a disaster. The names of the great battles that<br>finally broke the German armies are simply unknown to the general public.<br><br>The reason why the English anti-militarism disgusts foreign observers is<br>that it ignores the existence of the British Empire. It looks like sheer<br>hypocrisy. After all, the English have absorbed a quarter of the earth<br>and held on to it by means of a huge navy. How dare they then turn round<br>and say that war is wicked?<br><br>It is quite true that the English are hypocritical about their Empire. In<br>the working class this hypocrisy takes the form of not knowing that the<br>Empire exists. But their dislike of standing armies is a perfectly sound<br>instinct. A navy employs comparatively few people, and it is an external<br>weapon which cannot affect home politics directly. Military dictatorships<br>exist everywhere, but there is no such thing as a naval dictatorship.<br>What English people of nearly all classes loathe from the bottom of their<br>hearts is the swaggering officer type, the jingle of spurs and the crash<br>of boots. Decades before Hitler was ever heard of, the word 'Prussian'<br>had much the same significance in England as 'Nazi' has today. So deep<br>does this feeling go that for a hundred years past the officers of the<br>British army, in peace time, have always worn civilian clothes when off<br>duty.<br><br>One rapid but fairly sure guide to the social atmosphere of a country is<br>the parade-step of its army. A military parade is really a kind of ritual<br>dance, something like a ballet, expressing a certain philosophy of life.<br>The goose-step, for instance, is one of the most horrible sights in the<br>world, far more terrifying than a dive-bomber. It is simply an<br>affirmation of naked power; contained in it, quite consciously and<br>intentionally, is the vision of a boot crashing down on a face. Its<br>ugliness is part of its essence, for what it is saying is 'Yes, I am<br>UGLY, and you daren't laugh at me', like the bully who makes faces at his<br>victim. Why is the goose-step not used in England? There are, heaven<br>knows, plenty of army officers who would be only too glad to introduce<br>some such thing. It is not used because the people in the street would<br>laugh. Beyond a certain point, military display is only possible in<br>countries where the common people dare not laugh at the army. The<br>Italians adopted the goose-step at about the time when Italy passed<br>definitely under German control, and, as one would expect, they do it<br>less well than the Germans. The Vichy government, if it survives, is<br>bound to introduce a stiffer parade-ground discipline into what is left<br>of the French army. In the British army the drill is rigid and<br>complicated, full of memories of the eighteenth century, but without<br>definite swagger; the march is merely a formalized walk. It belongs to a<br>society which is ruled by the sword, no doubt, but a sword which must<br>never be taken out of the scabbard.<br><br>And yet the gentleness of English civilization is mixed up with<br>barbarities and anachronisms. Our criminal law is as out-of-date as the<br>muskets in the Tower. Over against the Nazi Storm Trooper you have got to<br>set that typically English figure, the hanging judge, some gouty old<br>bully with his mind rooted in the nineteenth century, handing out savage<br>sentences. In England people are still hanged by the neck and flogged<br>with the cat o' nine tails. Both of these punishments are obscene as well<br>as cruel, but there has never been any genuinely popular outcry against<br>them. People accept them (and Dartmoor, and Borstal) almost as they<br>accept the weather. They are part of 'the law', which is assumed to be<br>unalterable.<br><br>Here one comes upon an all-important English trait: the respect for<br>constitutionalism and legality, the belief in 'the law' as something<br>above the State and above the individual, something which is cruel and<br>stupid, of course, but at any rate INCORRUPTIBLE.<br><br>It is not that anyone imagines the law to be just. Everyone knows that<br>there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. But no one<br>accepts the implications of this, everyone takes it for granted that the<br>law, such as it is, will be respected, and feels a sense of outrage when<br>it is not. Remarks like 'They can't run me in; I haven't done anything<br>wrong', or 'They can't do that; it's against the law', are part of the<br>atmosphere of England. The professed enemies of society have this feeling<br>as strongly as anyone else. One sees it in prison-books like Wilfred<br>Macartney's WALLS HAVE MOUTHS or Jim Phelan's JAIL JOURNEY, in the solemn<br>idiocies that take place at the trials of conscientious objectors, in<br>letters to the papers from eminent Marxist professors, pointing out that<br>this or that is a 'miscarriage of British justice'. Everyone believes in<br>his heart that the law can be, ought to be, and, on the whole, will be<br>impartially administered. The totalitarian idea that there is no such<br>thing as law, there is only power, has never taken root. Even the<br>intelligentsia have only accepted it in theory.<br><br>An illusion can become a half-truth, a mask can alter the expression of a<br>face. The familiar arguments to the effect that democracy is 'just the<br>same as' or 'just as bad as' totalitarianism never take account of this<br>fact. All such arguments boil down to saying that half a loaf is the same<br>as no bread. In England such concepts as justice, liberty and objective<br>truth are still believed in. They may be illusions, but they are very<br>powerful illusions. The belief in them influences conduct, national life<br>is different because of them. In proof of which, look about you. Where<br>are the rubber truncheons, where is the castor oil? The sword is still in<br>the scabbard, and while it stays there corruption cannot go beyond a<br>certain point. The English electoral system, for instance, is an all but<br>open fraud. In a dozen obvious ways it is gerrymandered in the interest<br>of the moneyed class. But until some deep change has occurred in the<br>public mind, it cannot become COMPLETELY corrupt. You do not arrive at<br>the polling booth to find men with revolvers telling you which way to<br>vote, nor are the votes miscounted, nor is there any direct bribery. Even<br>hypocrisy is a powerful safeguard. The hanging judge, that evil old man<br>in scarlet robe and horse-hair wig, whom nothing short of dynamite will<br>ever teach what century he is living in, but who will at any rate<br>interpret the law according to the books and will in no circumstances<br>take a money bribe, is one of the symbolic figures of England. He is a<br>symbol of the strange mixture of reality and illusion, democracy and<br>privilege, humbug and decency, the subtle network of compromises, by<br>which the nation keeps itself in its familiar shape.<br><br><br>iii<br><br><br>I have spoken all the while of 'the nation', 'England', 'Britain', as<br>though forty-five million souls could somehow be treated as a unit. But<br>is not England notoriously two nations, the rich and the poor? Dare one<br>pretend that there is anything in common between people with £100,000 a<br>year and people with £1 a week? And even Welsh and Scottish readers are<br>likely to have been offended because I have used the word 'England'<br>oftener than 'Britain', as though the whole population dwelt in London<br>and the Home Counties and neither north nor west possessed a culture of<br>its own.<br><br>One gets a better view of this question if one considers the minor point<br>first. It is quite true that the so-called races of Britain feel<br>themselves to be very different from one another. A Scotsman, for<br>instance, does not thank you if you call him an Englishman. You can see<br>the hesitation we feel on this point by the fact that we call our islands<br>by no less than six different names, England, Britain, Great Britain, the<br>British Isles, the United Kingdom and, in very exalted moments, Albion.<br>Even the differences between north and south England loom large in our<br>own eyes. But somehow these differences fade away the moment that any two<br>Britons are confronted by a European. It is very rare to meet a<br>foreigner, other than an American, who can distinguish between English<br>and Scots or even English and Irish. To a Frenchman, the Breton and the<br>Auvergnat seem very different beings, and the accent of Marseilles is a<br>stock joke in Paris. Yet we speak of 'France' and 'the French',<br>recognizing France as an entity, a single civilization, which in fact it<br>is. So also with ourselves. Looked at from the outsider even the cockney<br>and the Yorkshireman have a strong family resemblance.<br><br>And even the distinction between rich and poor dwindles somewhat when one<br>regards the nation from the outside. There is no question about the<br>inequality of wealth in England. It is grosser than in any European<br>country, and you have only to look down the nearest street to see it.<br>Economically, England is certainly two nations, if not three or four. But<br>at the same time the vast majority of the people FEEL themselves to be a<br>single nation and are conscious of resembling one another more than they<br>resemble foreigners. Patriotism is usually stronger than class-hatred,<br>and always stronger than any kind of internationalism. Except for a brief<br>moment in 1920 (the 'Hands off Russia' movement) the British working<br>class have never thought or acted internationally. For two and a half<br>years they watched their comrades in Spain slowly strangled, and never<br>aided them by even a single strike[Note, below]. But when their own<br>country (the country of Lord Nuffield and Mr Montagu Norman) was in<br>danger, their attitude was very different. At the moment when it seemed<br>likely that England might be invaded, Anthony Eden appealed over the radio<br>for Local Defence Volunteers. He got a quarter of a million men in the<br>first twenty-four hours, and another million in the subsequent month. One<br>has only to compare these figures with, for instance, the number of<br>conscientious objectors to see how vast is the strength of traditional<br>loyalties compared with new ones.<br><br><br>[Note: It is true that they aided them to a certain extent with money.<br>Still, the sums raised for the various aid-Spain funds would not equal<br>five per cent of the turnover of the football pools during the same<br>period. (Author's footnote.)]<br><br><br>In England patriotism takes different forms in different classes, but it<br>runs like a connecting thread through nearly all of them. Only the<br>Europeanized intelligentsia are really immune to it. As a positive<br>emotion it is stronger in the middle class than in the upper class--the<br>cheap public schools, for instance, are more given to patriotic<br>demonstrations than the expensive ones--but the number of definitely<br>treacherous rich men, the Laval-Quisling type, is probably very small. In<br>the working class patriotism is profound, but it is unconscious. The<br>working man's heart does not leap when he sees a Union Jack. But the<br>famous 'insularity' and 'xenophobia' of the English is far stronger in<br>the working class than in the bourgeoisie. In all countries the poor are<br>more national than the rich, but the English working class are<br>outstanding in their abhorrence of foreign habits. Even when they are<br>obliged to live abroad for years they refuse either to accustom<br>themselves to foreign food or to learn foreign languages. Nearly every<br>Englishman of working-class origin considers it effeminate to pronounce a<br>foreign word correctly. During the war of 1914-18 the English working<br>class were in contact with foreigners to an extent that is rarely<br>possible. The sole result was that they brought back a hatred of all<br>Europeans, except the Germans, whose courage they admired. In four years<br>on French soil they did not even acquire a liking for wine. The<br>insularity of the English, their refusal to take foreigners seriously, is<br>a folly that has to be paid for very heavily from time to time. But it<br>plays its part in the English mystique, and the intellectuals who have<br>tried to break it down have generally done more harm than good. At bottom<br>it is the same quality in the English character that repels the tourist<br>and keeps out the invader.<br><br>Here one comes back to two English characteristics that I pointed out,<br>seemingly at random, at the beginning of the last chapter. One is the<br>lack of artistic ability. This is perhaps another way of saying that the<br>English are outside the European culture. For there is one art in which<br>they have shown plenty of talent, namely literature. But this is also the<br>only art that cannot cross frontiers. Literature, especially poetry, and<br>lyric poetry most of all, is a kind of family joke, with little or no<br>value outside its own language-group. Except for Shakespeare, the best<br>English poets are barely known in Europe, even as names. The only poets<br>who are widely read are Byron, who is admired for the wrong reasons, and<br>Oscar Wilde, who is pitied as a victim of English hypocrisy. And linked<br>up with this, though not very obviously, is the lack of philosophical<br>faculty, the absence in nearly all Englishmen of any need for an ordered<br>system of thought or even for the use of logic.<br><br>Up to a point, the sense of national unity is a substitute for a<br>'world-view'. Just because patriotism is all but universal and not even<br>the rich are uninfluenced by it, there can be moments when the whole<br>nation suddenly swings together and does the same thing, like a herd of<br>cattle facing a wolf. There was such a moment, unmistakably, at the time<br>of the disaster in France. After eight months of vaguely wondering what<br>the war was about, the people suddenly knew what they had got to do:<br>first, to get the army away from Dunkirk, and secondly to prevent<br>invasion. It was like the awakening of a giant. Quick! Danger! The<br>Philistines be upon thee, Samson! And then the swift unanimous action--<br>and, then, alas, the prompt relapse into sleep. In a divided nation that<br>would have been exactly the moment for a big peace movement to arise. But<br>does this mean that the instinct of the English will always tell them to<br>do the right thing? Not at all, merely that it will tell them to do the<br>same thing. In the 1931 General Election, for instance, we all did the<br>wrong thing in perfect unison. We were as single-minded as the Gadarene<br>swine. But I honestly doubt whether we can say that we were shoved down<br>the slope against our will.<br><br>It follows that British democracy is less of a fraud than it sometimes<br>appears. A foreign observer sees only the huge inequality of wealth, the<br>unfair electoral system, the governing-class control over the press, the<br>radio and education, and concludes that democracy is simply a polite name<br>for dictatorship. But this ignores the considerable agreement that does<br>unfortunately exist between the leaders and the led. However much one may<br>hate to admit it, it is almost certain that between 1931 and 1940 the<br>National Government represented the will of the mass of the people. It<br>tolerated slums, unemployment and a cowardly foreign policy. Yes, but so<br>did public opinion. It was a stagnant period, and its natural leaders<br>were mediocrities.<br><br>In spite of the campaigns of a few thousand left-wingers, it is fairly<br>certain that the bulk of the English people were behind Chamberlain's<br>foreign policy. More, it is fairly certain that the same struggle was<br>going on in Chamberlain's mind as in the minds of ordinary people. His<br>opponents professed to see in him a dark and wily schemer, plotting to<br>sell England to Hitler, but it is far likelier that he was merely a<br>stupid old man doing his best according to his very dim lights. It is<br>difficult otherwise to explain the contradictions of his policy, his<br>failure to grasp any of the courses that were open to him. Like the mass<br>of the people, he did not want to pay the price either of peace or of<br>war. And public opinion was behind him all the while, in policies that<br>were completely incompatible with one another. It was behind him when he<br>went to Munich, when he tried to come to an understanding with Russia,<br>when he gave the guarantee to Poland, when he honoured it, and when he<br>prosecuted the war half-heartedly. Only when the results of his policy<br>became apparent did it turn against him; which is to say that it turned<br>against its own lethargy of the past seven years. Thereupon the people<br>picked a leader nearer to their mood, Churchill, who was at any rate able<br>to grasp that wars are not won without fighting. Later, perhaps, they<br>will pick another leader who can grasp that only Socialist nations can<br>fight effectively.<br><br>Do I mean by all this that England is a genuine democracy? No, not even a<br>reader of the DAILY TELEGRAPH could quite swallow that.<br><br>England is the most class-ridden country under the sun. It is a land of<br>snobbery and privilege, ruled largely by the old and silly. But in any<br>calculation about it one has got to take into account its emotional<br>unity, the tendency of nearly all its inhabitants to feel alike and act<br>together in moments of supreme crisis. It is the only great country in<br>Europe that is not obliged to drive hundreds of thousands of its<br>nationals into exile or the concentration camp. At this moment, after a<br>year of war, newspapers and pamphlets abusing the Government, praising<br>the enemy and clamouring for surrender are being sold on the streets,<br>almost without interference. And this is less from a respect for freedom<br>of speech than from a simple perception that these things don't matter.<br>It is safe to let a paper like PEACE NEWS be sold, because it is certain<br>that ninety-five per cent of the population will never want to read it.<br>The nation is bound together by an invisible chain. At any normal time<br>the ruling class will rob, mismanage, sabotage, lead us into the muck;<br>but let popular opinion really make itself heard, let them get a tug from<br>below that they cannot avoid feeling, and it is difficult for them not to<br>respond. The left-wing writers who denounce the whole of the ruling class<br>as 'pro-Fascist' are grossly over-simplifying. Even among the inner<br>clique of politicians who brought us to our present pass, it is doubtful<br>whether there were any CONSCIOUS traitors. The corruption that happens in<br>England is seldom of that kind. Nearly always it is more in the nature of<br>self-deception, of the right hand not knowing what the left hand doeth.<br>And being unconscious, it is limited. One sees this at its most obvious<br>in the English press. Is the English press honest or dishonest? At normal<br>times it is deeply dishonest. All the papers that matter live off their<br>advertisements, and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over<br>news. Yet I do not suppose there is one paper in England that can be<br>straightforwardly bribed with hard cash. In the France of the Third<br>Republic all but a very few of the newspapers could notoriously be bought<br>over the counter like so many pounds of cheese. Public life in England<br>has never been OPENLY scandalous. It has not reached the pitch of<br>disintegration at which humbug can be dropped.<br><br>England is not the jewelled isle of Shakespeare's much-quoted message,<br>nor is it the inferno depicted by Dr Goebbels. More than either it<br>resembles a family, a rather stuffy Victorian family, with not many black<br>sheep in it but with all its cupboards bursting with skeletons. It has<br>rich relations who have to be kow-towed to and poor relations who are<br>horribly sat upon, and there is a deep conspiracy of silence about the<br>source of the family income. It is a family in which the young are<br>generally thwarted and most of the power is in the hands of irresponsible<br>uncles and bedridden aunts. Still, it is a family. It has its private<br>language and its common memories, and at the approach of an enemy it<br>closes its ranks. A family with the wrong members in control--that,<br>perhaps, is as near as one can come to describing England in a phrase.<br><br><br>iv<br><br><br>Probably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton,<br>but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there. One<br>of the dominant facts in English life during the past three quarters of a<br>century has been the decay of ability in the ruling class.<br><br>In the years between 1920 and 1940 it was happening with the speed of a<br>chemical reaction. Yet at the moment of writing it is still possible to<br>speak of a ruling class. Like the knife which has had two new blades and<br>three new handles, the upper fringe of English society is still almost<br>what it was in the mid nineteenth century. After 1832 the old land-owning<br>aristocracy steadily lost power, but instead of disappearing or becoming<br>a fossil they simply intermarried with the merchants, manufacturers and<br>financiers who had replaced them, and soon turned them into accurate<br>copies of themselves. The wealthy shipowner or cotton-miller set up for<br>himself an alibi as a country gentleman, while his sons learned the right<br>mannerisms at public schools which had been designed for just that<br>purpose. England was ruled by an aristocracy constantly recruited from<br>parvenus. And considering what energy the self-made men possessed, and<br>considering that they were buying their way into a class which at any<br>rate had a tradition of public service, one might have expected that able<br>rulers could be produced in some such way.<br><br>And yet somehow the ruling class decayed, lost its ability, its daring,<br>finally even its ruthlessness, until a time came when stuffed shirts like<br>Eden or Halifax could stand out as men of exceptional talent. As for<br>Baldwin, one could not even dignify him with the name of stuffed shirt.<br>He was simply a hole in the air. The mishandling of England's domestic<br>problems during the nineteen-twenties had been bad enough, but British<br>foreign policy between 1931 and 1939 is one of the wonders of the world.<br>Why? What had happened? What was it that at every decisive moment made<br>every British statesman do the wrong thing with so unerring an instinct?<br><br>The underlying fact was that the whole position of the moneyed class had<br>long ceased to be justifiable. There they sat, at the centre of a vast<br>empire and a world-wide financial network, drawing interest and profits<br>and spending them--on what? It was fair to say that life within the<br>British Empire was in many ways better than life outside it. Still, the<br>Empire was underdeveloped, India slept in the Middle Ages, the Dominions<br>lay empty, with foreigners jealously barred out, and even England was<br>full of slums and unemployment. Only half a million people, the people in<br>the country houses, definitely benefited from the existing system.<br>Moreover, the tendency of small businesses to merge together into large<br>ones robbed more and more of the moneyed class of their function and<br>turned them into mere owners, their work being done for them by salaried<br>managers and technicians. For long past there had been in England an<br>entirely functionless class, living on money that was invested they<br>hardly knew where, the 'idle rich', the people whose photographs you can<br>look at in the TATLER and the BYSTANDER, always supposing that you want<br>to. The existence of these people was by any standard unjustifiable. They<br>were simply parasites, less useful to society than his fleas are to a<br>dog.<br><br>By 1920 there were many people who were aware of all this. By 1930<br>millions were aware of it. But the British ruling class obviously could<br>not admit to themselves that their usefulness was at an end. Had they<br>done that they would have had to abdicate. For it was not possible for<br>them to turn themselves into mere bandits, like the American<br>millionaires, consciously clinging to unjust privileges and beating down<br>opposition by bribery and tear-gas bombs. After all, they belonged to a<br>class with a certain tradition, they had been to public schools where the<br>duty of dying for your country, if necessary, is laid down as the first<br>and greatest of the Commandments. They had to FEEL themselves true<br>patriots, even while they plundered their countrymen. Clearly there was<br>only one escape for them--into stupidity. They could keep society in its<br>existing shape only by being UNABLE to grasp that any improvement was<br>possible. Difficult though this was, they achieved it, largely by fixing<br>their eyes on the past and refusing to notice the changes that were going<br>on round them.<br><br>There is much in England that this explains. It explains the decay of<br>country life, due to the keeping-up of a sham feudalism which drives the<br>more spirited workers off the land. It explains the immobility of the<br>public schools, which have barely altered since the eighties of the last<br>century. It explains the military incompetence which has again and again<br>startled the world. Since the fifties every war in which England has<br>engaged has started off with a series of disasters, after which the<br>situation has been saved by people comparatively low in the social scale.<br>The higher commanders, drawn from the aristocracy, could never prepare<br>for modern war, because in order to do so they would have had to admit to<br>themselves that the world was changing. They have always clung to<br>obsolete methods and weapons, because they inevitably saw each war as a<br>repetition of the last. Before the Boer War they prepared for the Zulu<br>War, before the 1914 for the Boer War, and before the present war for<br>1914. Even at this moment hundreds of thousands of men in England are<br>being trained with the bayonet, a weapon entirely useless except for<br>opening tins. It is worth noticing that the navy and, latterly, the air<br>force, have always been more efficient than the regular army. But the<br>navy is only partially, and the air force hardly at all, within the<br>ruling-class orbit.<br><br>It must be admitted that so long as things were peaceful the methods of<br>the British ruling class served them well enough. Their own people<br>manifestly tolerated them. However unjustly England might be organized,<br>it was at any rate not torn by class warfare or haunted by secret police.<br>The Empire was peaceful as no area of comparable size has ever been.<br>Throughout its vast extent, nearly a quarter of the earth, there were<br>fewer armed men than would be found necessary by a minor Balkan state. As<br>people to live under, and looking at them merely from a liberal, NEGATIVE<br>standpoint, the British ruling class had their points. They were<br>preferable to the truly modern men, the Nazis and Fascists. But it had<br>long been obvious that they would be helpless against any serious attack<br>from the outside.<br><br>They could not struggle against Nazism or Fascism, because they could not<br>understand them. Neither could they have struggled against Communism, if<br>Communism had been a serious force in western Europe. To understand<br>Fascism they would have had to study the theory of Socialism, which would<br>have forced them to realize that the economic system by which they lived<br>was unjust, inefficient and out-of-date. But it was exactly this fact<br>that they had trained themselves never to face. They dealt with Fascism<br>as the cavalry generals of 1914 dealt with the machine-guns--by ignoring<br>it. After years of aggression and massacres, they had grasped only one<br>fact, that Hitler and Mussolini were hostile to Communism. Therefore, it<br>was argued, they MUST be friendly to the British dividend-drawer. Hence<br>the truly frightening spectacle of Conservative M.P.s wildly cheering the<br>news that British ships, bringing food to the Spanish Republican<br>government, had been bombed by Italian aeroplanes. Even when they had<br>begun to grasp that Fascism was dangerous, its essentially revolutionary<br>nature, the huge military effort it was capable of making, the sort of<br>tactics it would use, were quite beyond their comprehension. At the time<br>of the Spanish Civil War, anyone with as much political knowledge as can<br>be acquired from a sixpenny pamphlet on Socialism knew that, if Franco<br>won, the result would be strategically disastrous for England; and yet<br>generals and admirals who had given their lives to the study of war were<br>unable to grasp this fact. This vein of political ignorance runs right<br>through English official life, through Cabinet ministers, ambassadors,<br>consuls, judges, magistrates, policemen. The policeman who arrests the<br>'red' does not understand the theories the 'red' is preaching; if he did<br>his own position as bodyguard of the moneyed class might seem less<br>pleasant to him. There is reason to think that even military espionage is<br>hopelessly hampered by ignorance of the new economic doctrines and the<br>ramifications of the underground parties.<br><br>The British ruling class were not altogether wrong in thinking that<br>Fascism was on their side. It is a fact that any rich man, unless he is a<br>Jew, has less to fear from Fascism than from either Communism or<br>democratic Socialism. One ought never to forget this, for nearly the<br>whole of German and Italian propaganda is designed to cover it up. The<br>natural instinct of men like Simon, Hoare, Chamberlain etc. was to come<br>to an agreement with Hitler. But--and here the peculiar feature of<br>English life that I have spoken of, the deep sense of national<br>solidarity, comes in--they could only do so by breaking up the Empire<br>and selling their own people into semi-slavery. A truly corrupt class<br>would have done this without hesitation, as in France. But things had not<br>gone that distance in England. Politicians who would make cringing<br>speeches about 'the duty of loyalty to our conquerors' are hardly to be<br>found in English public life. Tossed to and fro between their incomes and<br>their principles, it was impossible that men like Chamberlain should do<br>anything but make the worst of both worlds.<br><br>One thing that has always shown that the English ruling class are MORALLY<br>fairly sound, is that in time of war they are ready enough to get<br>themselves killed. Several dukes, earls and what nots were killed in the<br>recent campaign in Flanders. That could not happen if these people were<br>the cynical scoundrels that they are sometimes declared to be. It is<br>important not to misunderstand their motives, or one cannot predict their<br>actions. What is to be expected of them is not treachery, or physical<br>cowardice, but stupidity, unconscious sabotage, an infallible instinct<br>for doing the wrong thing. They are not wicked, or not altogether wicked;<br>they are merely unteachable. Only when their money and power are gone<br>will the younger among them begin to grasp what century they are living<br>in.<br><br><br>v<br><br><br>The stagnation of the Empire in the between-war years affected everyone<br>in England, but it had an especially direct effect upon two important<br>sub-sections of the middle class. One was the military and imperialist<br>middle class, generally nicknamed the Blimps, and the other the left-wing<br>intelligentsia. These two seemingly hostile types, symbolic opposites--<br>the half-pay colonel with his bull neck and diminutive brain, like a<br>dinosaur, the highbrow with his domed forehead and stalk-like neck--are<br>mentally linked together and constantly interact upon one another; in any<br>case they are born to a considerable extent into the same families.<br><br>Thirty years ago the Blimp class was already losing its vitality. The<br>middle-class families celebrated by Kipling, the prolific lowbrow<br>families whose sons officered the army and navy and swarmed over all the<br>waste places of the earth from the Yukon to the Irrawaddy, were dwindling<br>before 1914. The thing that had killed them was the telegraph. In a<br>narrowing world, more and more governed from Whitehall, there was every<br>year less room for individual initiative. Men like Clive, Nelson,<br>Nicholson, Gordon would find no place for themselves in the modern<br>British Empire. By 1920 nearly every inch of the colonial empire was in<br>the grip of Whitehall. Well-meaning, over-civilized men, in dark suits<br>and black felt hats, with neatly rolled umbrellas crooked over the left<br>forearm, were imposing their constipated view of life on Malaya and<br>Nigeria, Mombasa and Mandalay. The one-time empire builders were reduced<br>to the status of clerks, buried deeper and deeper under mounds of paper<br>and red tape. In the early twenties one could see, all over the Empire,<br>the older officials, who had known more spacious days, writhing<br>impotently under the changes that were happening. From that time onwards<br>it has been next door to impossible to induce young men of spirit to take<br>any part in imperial administration. And what was true of the official<br>world was true also of the commercial. The great monopoly companies<br>swallowed up hosts of petty traders. Instead of going out to trade<br>adventurously in the Indies one went to an office stool in Bombay or<br>Singapore. And life in Bombay or Singapore was actually duller and safer<br>than life in London. Imperialist sentiment remained strong in the middle<br>class, chiefly owing to family tradition, but the job of administering<br>the Empire had ceased to appeal. Few able men went east of Suez if there<br>was any way of avoiding it.<br><br>But the general weakening of imperialism, and to some extent of the whole<br>British morale, that took place during the nineteen-thirties, was partly<br>the work of the left-wing intelligentsia, itself a kind of growth that<br>had sprouted from the stagnation of the Empire.<br><br>It should be noted that there is now no intelligentsia that is not in<br>some sense 'left'. Perhaps the last right-wing intellectual was T. E.<br>Lawrence. Since about 1930 everyone describable as an 'intellectual' has<br>lived in a state of chronic discontent with the existing order.<br>Necessarily so, because society as it was constituted had no room for<br>him. In an Empire that was simply stagnant, neither being developed nor<br>falling to pieces, and in an England ruled by people whose chief asset<br>was their stupidity, to be 'clever' was to be suspect. If you had the<br>kind of brain that could understand the poems of T. S. Eliot or the<br>theories of Karl Marx, the higher-ups would see to it that you were kept<br>out of any important job. The intellectuals could find a function for<br>themselves only in the literary reviews and the left-wing political<br>parties.<br><br>The mentality of the English left-wing intelligentsia can be studied in<br>half a dozen weekly and monthly papers. The immediately striking thing<br>about all these papers is their generally negative, querulous attitude,<br>their complete lack at all times of any constructive suggestion. There is<br>little in them except the irresponsible carping of people who have never<br>been and never expect to be in a position of power. Another marked<br>characteristic is the emotional shallowness of people who live in a world<br>of ideas and have little contact with physical reality. Many<br>intellectuals of the Left were flabbily pacifist up to 1935, shrieked for<br>war against Germany in the years 1935-9, and then promptly cooled off<br>when the war started. It is broadly though not precisely true that the<br>people who were most 'anti-Fascist' during the Spanish Civil War are most<br>defeatist now. And underlying this is the really important fact about so<br>many of the English intelligentsia--their severance from the common<br>culture of the country.<br><br>In intention, at any rate, the English intelligentsia are Europeanized.<br>They take their cookery from Paris and their opinions from Moscow. In the<br>general patriotism of the country they form a sort of island of dissident<br>thought. England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals<br>are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always<br>felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman<br>and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse<br>racing to suet puddings. It is a strange fact, but it is unquestionably<br>true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of<br>standing to attention during 'God save the King' than of stealing from a<br>poor box. All through the critical years many left-wingers were chipping<br>away at English morale, trying to spread an outlook that was sometimes<br>squashily pacifist, sometimes violently pro-Russian, but always<br>anti-British. It is questionable how much effect this had, but it<br>certainly had some. If the English people suffered for several years a<br>real weakening of morale, so that the Fascist nations judged that they<br>were 'decadent' and that it was safe to plunge into war, the intellectual<br>sabotage from the Left was partly responsible. Both the NEW STATESMAN and<br>the NEWS CHRONICLE cried out against the Munich settlement, but even they<br>had done something to make it possible. Ten years of systematic<br>Blimp-baiting affected even the Blimps themselves and made it harder than<br>it had been before to get intelligent young men to enter the armed<br>forces. Given the stagnation of the Empire, the military middle class<br>must have decayed in any case, but the spread of a shallow Leftism<br>hastened the process.<br><br>It is clear that the special position of the English intellectuals during<br>the past ten years, as purely NEGATIVE creatures, mere anti-Blimps, was a<br>by-product of ruling-class stupidity. Society could not use them, and<br>they had not got it in them to see that devotion to one's country implies<br>'for better, for worse'. Both Blimps and highbrows took for granted, as<br>though it were a law of nature, the divorce between patriotism and<br>intelligence. If you were a patriot you read BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE and<br>publicly thanked God that you were 'not brainy'. If you were an<br>intellectual you sniggered at the Union Jack and regarded physical<br>courage as barbarous. It is obvious that this preposterous convention<br>cannot continue. The Bloomsbury highbrow, with his mechanical snigger, is<br>as out-of-date as the cavalry colonel. A modern nation cannot afford<br>either of them. Patriotism and intelligence will have to come together<br>again. It is the fact that we are fighting a war, and a very peculiar<br>kind of war, that may make this possible.<br><br><br>vi<br><br>One of the most important developments in England during the past twenty<br>years has been the upward and downward extension of the middle class. It<br>has happened on such a scale as to make the old classification of society<br>into capitalists, proletarians and petit bourgeois (small<br>property-owners) almost obsolete.<br><br>England is a country in which property and financial power are<br>concentrated in very few hands. Few people in modern England OWN anything<br>at all, except clothes, furniture and possibly a house. The peasantry<br>have long since disappeared, the independent shopkeeper is being<br>destroyed, the small businessman is diminishing in numbers. But at the<br>same time modern industry is so complicated that it cannot get along<br>without great numbers of managers, salesmen, engineers, chemists and<br>technicians of all kinds, drawing fairly large salaries. And these in<br>turn call into being a professional class of doctors, lawyers, teachers,<br>artists, etc. etc. The tendency of advanced capitalism has therefore been<br>to enlarge the middle class and not to wipe it out as it once seemed<br>likely to do.<br><br>But much more important than this is the spread of middle-class ideas and<br>habits among the working class. The British working class are now better<br>off in almost all ways than they were thirty years ago. This is partly<br>due to the efforts of the trade unions, but partly to the mere advance of<br>physical science. It is not always realized that within rather narrow<br>limits the standard of life of a country can rise without a corresponding<br>rise in real wages. Up to a point, civilization can lift itself up by its<br>boot-tags. However unjustly society is organized, certain technical<br>advances are bound to benefit the whole community, because certain kinds<br>of goods are necessarily held in common. A millionaire cannot, for<br>example, light the streets for himself while darkening them for other<br>people. Nearly all citizens of civilized countries now enjoy the use of<br>good roads, germ-free water, police protection, free libraries and<br>probably free education of a kind. Public education in England has been<br>meanly starved of money, but it has nevertheless improved, largely owing<br>to the devoted efforts of the teachers, and the habit of reading has<br>become enormously more widespread. To an increasing extent the rich and<br>the poor read the same books, and they also see the same films and listen<br>to the same radio programmes. And the differences in their way of life<br>have been diminished by the mass-production of cheap clothes and<br>improvements in housing. So far as outward appearance goes, the clothes<br>of rich and poor, especially in the case of women, differ far less than<br>they did thirty or even fifteen years ago. As to housing, England still<br>has slums which are a blot on civilization, but much building has been<br>done during the past ten years, largely by the local authorities. The<br>modern council house, with its bathroom and electric light, is smaller<br>than the stockbroker's villa, but it is recognizably the same kind of<br>house, which the farm labourer's cottage is not. A person who has grown<br>up in a council housing estate is likely to be--indeed, visibly is--<br>more middle class in outlook than a person who has grown up in a slum.<br><br>The effect of all this is a general softening of manners. It is enhanced<br>by the fact that modern industrial methods tend always to demand less<br>muscular effort and therefore to leave people with more energy when their<br>day's work is done. Many workers in the light industries are less truly<br>manual labourers than is a doctor or a grocer. In tastes, habits, manners<br>and outlook the working class and the middle class are drawing together.<br>The unjust distinctions remain, but the real differences diminish. The<br>old-style 'proletarian'--collarless, unshaven and with muscles warped by<br>heavy labour--still exists, but he is constantly decreasing in numbers;<br>he only predominates in the heavy-industry areas of the north of England.<br><br>After 1918 there began to appear something that had never existed in<br>England before: people of indeterminate social class. In 1910 every human<br>being in these islands could be 'placed' in an instant by his clothes,<br>manners and accent. That is no longer the case. Above all, it is not the<br>case in the new townships that have developed as a result of cheap motor<br>cars and the southward shift of industry. The place to look for the germs<br>of the future England is in light-industry areas and along the arterial<br>roads. In Slough, Dagenham, Barnet, Letchworth, Hayes--everywhere,<br>indeed, on the outskirts of great towns--the old pattern is gradually<br>changing into something new. In those vast new wildernesses of glass and<br>brick the sharp distinctions of the older kind of town, with its slums<br>and mansions, or of the country, with its manor-houses and squalid<br>cottages, no longer exist. There are wide gradations of income, but it is<br>the same kind of life that is being lived at different levels, in<br>labour-saving flats or council houses, along the concrete roads and in<br>the naked democracy of the swimming-pools. It is a rather restless,<br>cultureless life, centring round tinned food, PICTURE POST, the radio and<br>the internal combustion engine. It is a civilization in which children<br>grow up with an intimate knowledge of magnetoes and in complete ignorance<br>of the Bible. To that civilization belong the people who are most at home<br>in and most definitely OF the modern world, the technicians and the<br>higher-paid skilled workers, the airmen and their mechanics, the radio<br>experts, film producers, popular journalists and industrial chemists.<br>They are the indeterminate stratum at which the older class distinctions<br>are beginning to break down.<br><br>This war, unless we are defeated, will wipe out most of the existing<br>class privileges. There are every day fewer people who wish them to<br>continue. Nor need we fear that as the pattern changes life in England<br>will lose its peculiar flavour. The new red cities of Greater London are<br>crude enough, but these things are only the rash that accompanies a<br>change. In whatever shape England emerges from the war it will be deeply<br>tinged with the characteristics that I have spoken of earlier. The<br>intellectuals who hope to see it Russianized or Germanized will be<br>disappointed. The gentleness, the hypocrisy, the thoughtlessness, the<br>reverence for law and the hatred of uniforms will remain, along with the<br>suet puddings and the misty skies. It needs some very great disaster,<br>such as prolonged subjugation by a foreign enemy, to destroy a national<br>culture. The Stock Exchange will be pulled down, the horse plough will<br>give way to the tractor, the country houses will be turned into<br>children's holiday camps, the Eton and Harrow match will be forgotten,<br>but England will still be England, an everlasting animal stretching into<br>the future and the past, and, like all living things, having the power to<br>change out of recognition and yet remain the same.<br><br><br><br>Part II<br><br><br>Shopkeepers at War<br><br><br>i<br><br>I began this book to the tune of German bombs, and I begin this second<br>chapter in the added racket of the barrage. The yellow gunflashes are<br>lighting the sky, the splinters are rattling on the housetops, and London<br>Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down. Anyone able to read a<br>map knows that we are in deadly danger. I do not mean that we are beaten<br>or need be beaten. Almost certainly the outcome depends on our own will.<br>But at this moment we are in the soup, full fathom five, and we have been<br>brought there by follies which we are still committing and which will<br>drown us altogether if we do not mend our ways quickly.<br><br>What this war has demonstrated is that private capitalismthat is, an<br>economic system in which land, factories, mines and transport are owned<br>privately and operated solely for profit--DOES NOT WORK. It cannot deliver<br>the goods. This fact had been known to millions of people for years past,<br>but nothing ever came of it, because there was no real urge from below to<br>alter the system, and those at the top had trained themselves to be<br>impenetrably stupid on just this point. Argument and propaganda got one<br>nowhere. The lords of property simply sat on their bottoms and proclaimed<br>that all was for the best. Hitler's conquest of Europe, however, was a<br>PHYSICAL debunking of capitalism. War, for all its evil, is at any rate<br>an unanswerable test of strength, like a try-your-grip machine. Great<br>strength returns the penny, and there is no way of faking the result.<br><br>When the nautical screw was first invented, there was a controversy that<br>lasted for years as to whether screw-steamers or paddle-steamers were<br>better. The paddle-steamers, like all obsolete things, had their<br>champions, who supported them by ingenious arguments. Finally, however, a<br>distinguished admiral tied a screw-steamer and a paddlesteamer of equal<br>horse-power stern to stern and set their engines running. That settled<br>the question once and for all. And it was something similar that happened<br>on the fields of Norway and of Flanders. Once and for all it was proved<br>that a planned economy is stronger than a planless one. But it is<br>necessary here to give some kind of definition to those much-abused<br>words, Socialism and Fascism.<br><br>Socialism is usually defined as "common ownership of the means of<br>production". Crudely: the State, representing the whole nation, owns<br>everything, and everyone is a State employee. This does NOT mean that<br>people are stripped of private possessions such as clothes and furniture,<br>but it DOES mean that all productive goods, such as land, mines, ships<br>and machinery, are the property of the State. The State is the sole<br>large-scale producer. It is not certain that Socialism is in all ways<br>superior to capitalism, but it is certain that, unlike capitalism, it can<br>solve the problems of production and consumption. At normal times a<br>capitalist economy can never consume all that it produces, so that there<br>is always a wasted surplus (wheat burned in furnaces, herrings dumped<br>back into the sea etc etc) and always unemployment. In time of war, on<br>the other hand, it has difficulty in producing all that it needs, because<br>nothing is produced unless someone sees his way to making a profit out of<br>it. In a Socialist economy these problems do not exist. The State simply<br>calculates what goods will be needed and does its best to produce them.<br>Production is only limited by the amount of labour and raw materials.<br>Money, for internal purposes, ceases to be a mysterious all-powerful<br>thing and becomes a sort of coupon or ration-ticket, issued in sufficient<br>quantities to buy up such consumption goods as may be available at the<br>moment.<br><br>However, it has become clear in the last few years that "common ownership<br>of the means of production" is not in itself a sufficient definition of<br>Socialism. One must also add the following: approximate equality of<br>incomes (it need be no more than approximate), political democr<br><br></font></p>
