<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">In Moulmein, in lower Burma, I was hated by large numbers of people--the<br>only time in my life that I have been important enough for this to happen<br>to me. I was sub-divisional police officer of the town, and in an<br>aimless, petty kind of way anti-European feeling was very bitter. No one<br>had the guts to raise a riot, but if a European woman went through the<br>bazaars alone somebody would probably spit betel juice over her dress. As<br>a police officer I was an obvious target and was baited whenever it<br>seemed safe to do so. When a nimble Burman tripped me up on the football<br>field and the referee (another Burman) looked the other way, the crowd<br>yelled with hideous laughter. This happened more than once. In the end<br>the sneering yellow faces of young men that met me everywhere, the<br>insults hooted after me when I was at a safe distance, got badly on my<br>nerves. The young Buddhist priests were the worst of all. There were<br>several thousands of them in the town and none of them seemed to have<br>anything to do except stand on street corners and jeer at Europeans.<br><br>All this was perplexing and upsetting. For at that time I had already<br>made up my mind that imperialism was an evil thing and the sooner I<br>chucked up my job and got out of it the better. Theoretically--and<br>secretly, of course--I was all for the Burmese and all against their<br>oppressors, the British. As for the job I was doing, I hated it more<br>bitterly than I can perhaps make clear. In a job like that you see the<br>dirty work of Empire at close quarters. The wretched prisoners huddling<br>in the stinking cages of the lock-ups, the grey, cowed faces of the<br>long-term convicts, the scarred buttocks of the men who had been Bogged<br>with bamboos--all these oppressed me with an intolerable sense of guilt.<br>But I could get nothing into perspective. I was young and ill-educated<br>and I had had to think out my problems in the utter silence that is<br>imposed on every Englishman in the East. I did not even know that the<br>British Empire is dying, still less did I know that it is a great deal<br>better than the younger empires that are going to supplant it. All I knew<br>was that I was stuck between my hatred of the empire I served and my rage<br>against the evil-spirited little beasts who tried to make my job<br>impossible. With one part of my mind I thought of the British Raj as an<br>unbreakable tyranny, as something clamped down, IN SAECULA SAECULORUM,<br>upon the will of prostrate peoples; with another part I thought that the<br>greatest joy in the world would be to drive a bayonet into a Buddhist<br>priest's guts. Feelings like these are the normal by-products of<br>imperialism; ask any Anglo-Indian official, if you can catch him off<br>duty.<br><br>One day something happened which in a roundabout way was enlightening. It<br>was a tiny incident in itself, but it gave me a better glimpse than I had<br>had before of the real nature of imperialism--the real motives for which<br>despotic governments act. Early one morning the sub-inspector at a police<br>station the other end of the town rang me up on the phone and said that<br>an elephant was ravaging the bazaar. Would I please come and do something<br>about it? I did not know what I could do, but I wanted to see what was<br>happening and I got on to a pony and started out. I took my rifle, an<br>old .44 Winchester and much too small to kill an elephant, but I thought<br>the noise might be useful IN TERROREM. Various Burmans stopped me on the<br>way and told me about the elephant's doings. It was not, of course, a<br>wild<br>elephant, but a tame one which had gone "must." It had been chained up,<br>as tame elephants always are when their attack of "must" is due, but on<br>the previous night it had broken its chain and escaped. Its mahout, the<br>only person who could manage it when it was in that state, had set out in<br>pursuit, but had taken the wrong direction and was now twelve hours'<br>journey away, and in the morning the elephant had suddenly reappeared in<br>the town. The Burmese population had no weapons and were quite helpless<br>against it. It had already destroyed somebody's bamboo hut, killed a cow<br>and raided some fruit-stalls and devoured the stock; also it had met the<br>municipal rubbish van and, when the driver jumped out and took to his<br>heels, had turned the van over and inflicted violences upon it.<br><br>The Burmese sub-inspector and some Indian constables were waiting for me<br>in the quarter where the elephant had been seen. It was a very poor<br>quarter, a labyrinth of squalid bamboo huts, thatched with palmleaf,<br>winding all over a steep hillside. I remember that it was a cloudy,<br>stuffy morning at the beginning of the rains. We began questioning the<br>people as to where the elephant had gone and, as usual, failed to get any<br>definite information. That is invariably the case in the East; a story<br>always sounds clear enough at a distance, but the nearer you get to the<br>scene of events the vaguer it becomes. Some of the people said that the<br>elephant had gone in one direction, some said that he had gone in<br>another, some professed not even to have heard of any elephant. I had<br>almost made up my mind that the whole story was a pack of lies, when we<br>heard yells a little distance away. There was a loud, scandalized cry of<br>"Go away, child! Go away this instant!" and an old woman with a switch in<br>her hand came round the corner of a hut, violently shooing away a crowd<br>of naked children. Some more women followed, clicking their tongues and<br>exclaiming; evidently there was something that the children ought not to<br>have seen. I rounded the hut and saw a man's dead body sprawling in the<br>mud. He was an Indian, a black Dravidian coolie, almost naked, and he<br>could not have been dead many minutes. The people said that the elephant<br>had come suddenly upon him round the corner of the hut, caught him with<br>its trunk, put its foot on his back and ground him into the earth. This<br>was the rainy season and the ground was soft, and his face had scored a<br>trench a foot deep and a couple of yards long. He was lying on his belly<br>with arms crucified and head sharply twisted to one side. His face was<br>coated with mud, the eyes wide open, the teeth bared and grinning with an<br>expression of unendurable agony. (Never tell me, by the way, that the<br>dead look peaceful. Most of the corpses I have seen looked devilish.) The<br>friction of the great beast's foot had stripped the skin from his back as<br>neatly as one skins a rabbit. As soon as I saw the dead man I sent an<br>orderly to a friend's house nearby to borrow an elephant rifle. I had<br>already sent back the pony, not wanting it to go mad with fright and<br>throw me if it smelt the elephant.<br><br>The orderly came back in a few minutes with a rifle and five cartridges,<br>and meanwhile some Burmans had arrived and told us that the elephant was<br>in the paddy fields below, only a few hundred yards away. As I started<br>forward practically the whole population of the quarter flocked out of<br>the houses and followed me. They had seen the rifle and were all shouting<br>excitedly that I was going to shoot the elephant. They had not shown much<br>interest in the elephant when he was merely ravaging their homes, but it<br>was different now that he was going to be shot. It was a bit of fun to<br>them, as it would be to an English crowd; besides they wanted the meat.<br>It made me vaguely uneasy. I had no intention of shooting the elephant--I<br>had merely sent for the rifle to defend myself if necessary--and it is<br>always unnerving to have a crowd following you. I marched down the hill,<br>looking and feeling a fool, with the rifle over my shoulder and an<br>ever-growing army of people jostling at my heels. At the bottom, when you<br>got away from the huts, there was a metalled road and beyond that a miry<br>waste of paddy fields a thousand yards across, not yet ploughed but soggy<br>from the first rains and dotted with coarse grass. The elephant was<br>standing eight yards from the road, his left side towards us. He took not<br>the slightest notice of the crowd's approach. He was tearing up bunches<br>of grass, beating them against his knees to clean them and stuffing them<br>into his mouth.<br><br>I had halted on the road. As soon as I saw the elephant I knew with<br>perfect certainty that I ought not to shoot him. It is a serious matter<br>to shoot a working elephant--it is comparable to destroying a huge and<br>costly piece of machinery--and obviously one ought not to do it if it can<br>possibly be avoided. And at that distance, peacefully eating, the<br>elephant looked no more dangerous than a cow. I thought then and I think<br>now that his attack of "must" was already passing off; in which case he<br>would merely wander harmlessly about until the mahout came back and<br>caught him. Moreover, I did not in the least want to shoot him. I decided<br>that I would watch him for a little while to make sure that he did not<br>turn savage again, and then go home.<br><br>But at that moment I glanced round at the crowd that had followed me. It<br>was an immense crowd, two thousand at the least and growing every minute.<br>It blocked the road for a long distance on either side. I looked at the<br>sea of yellow faces above the garish clothes-faces all happy and excited<br>over this bit of fun, all certain that the elephant was going to be shot.<br>They were watching me as they would watch a conjurer about to perform a<br>trick. They did not like me, but with the magical rifle in my hands I was<br>momentarily worth watching. And suddenly I realized that I should have to<br>shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me and I had got<br>to do it; I could feel their two thousand wills pressing me forward,<br>irresistibly. And it was at this moment, as I stood there with the rifle<br>in my hands, that I first grasped the hollowness, the futility of the<br>white man's dominion in the East. Here was I, the white man with his gun,<br>standing in front of the unarmed native crowd--seemingly the leading<br>actor of the piece; but in reality I was only an absurd puppet pushed to<br>and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind. I perceived in this<br>moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he<br>destroys. He becomes a sort of hollow, posing dummy, the conventionalized<br>figure of a sahib. For it is the condition of his rule that he shall<br>spend his life in trying to impress the "natives," and so in every crisis<br>he has got to do what the "natives" expect of him. He wears a mask, and<br>his face grows to fit it. I had got to shoot the elephant. I had<br>committed myself to doing it when I sent for the rifle. A sahib has got<br>to act like a sahib; he has got to appear resolute, to know his own mind<br>and do definite things. To come all that way, rifle in hand, with two<br>thousand people marching at my heels, and then to trail feebly away,<br>having done nothing--no, that was impossible. The crowd would laugh at<br>me. And my whole life, every white man's life in the East, was one long<br>struggle not to be laughed at.<br><br>But I did not want to shoot the elephant. I watched him beating his bunch<br>of grass against his knees, with that preoccupied grandmotherly air that<br>elephants have. It seemed to me that it would be murder to shoot him. At<br>that age I was not squeamish about killing animals, but I had never shot<br>an elephant and never wanted to. (Somehow it always seems worse to kill a<br>LARGE animal.) Besides, there was the beast's owner to be considered.<br>Alive, the elephant was worth at least a hundred pounds; dead, he would<br>only be worth the value of his tusks, five pounds, possibly. But I had<br>got to act quickly. I turned to some experienced-looking Burmans who had<br>been there when we arrived, and asked them how the elephant had been<br>behaving. They all said the same thing: he took no notice of you if you<br>left him alone, but he might charge if you went too close to him.<br><br>It was perfectly clear to me what I ought to do. I ought to walk up to<br>within, say, twenty-five yards of the elephant and test his behavior. If<br>he charged, I could shoot; if he took no notice of me, it would be safe<br>to leave him until the mahout came back. But also I knew that I was going<br>to do no such thing. I was a poor shot with a rifle and the ground was<br>soft mud into which one would sink at every step. If the elephant charged<br>and I missed him, I should have about as much chance as a toad under a<br>steam-roller. But even then I was not thinking particularly of my own<br>skin, only of the watchful yellow faces behind. For at that moment, with<br>the crowd watching me, I was not afraid in the ordinary sense, as I would<br>have been if I had been alone. A white man mustn't be frightened in front<br>of "natives"; and so, in general, he isn't frightened. The sole thought<br>in my mind was that if anything went wrong those two thousand Burmans<br>would see me pursued, caught, trampled on and reduced to a grinning<br>corpse like that Indian up the hill. And if that happened it was quite<br>probable that some of them would laugh. That would never do.<br><br>There was only one alternative. I shoved the cartridges into the magazine<br>and lay down on the road to get a better aim. The crowd grew very still,<br>and a deep, low, happy sigh, as of people who see the theatre curtain go<br>up at last, breathed from innumerable throats. They were going to have<br>their bit of fun after all. The rifle was a beautiful German thing with<br>cross-hair sights. I did not then know that in shooting an elephant one<br>would shoot to cut an imaginary bar running from ear-hole to ear-hole. I<br>ought, therefore, as the elephant was sideways on, to have aimed straight<br>at his ear-hole, actually I aimed several inches in front of this,<br>thinking the brain would be further forward.<br><br>When I pulled the trigger I did not hear the bang or feel the kick--one<br>never does when a shot goes home--but I heard the devilish roar of glee<br>that went up from the crowd. In that instant, in too short a time, one<br>would have thought, even for the bullet to get there, a mysterious,<br>terrible change had come over the elephant. He neither stirred nor fell,<br>but every line of his body had altered. He looked suddenly stricken,<br>shrunken, immensely old, as though the frighfful impact of the bullet had<br>paralysed him without knocking him down. At last, after what seemed a<br>long time--it might have been five seconds, I dare say--he sagged<br>flabbily to his knees. His mouth slobbered. An enormous senility seemed<br>to have settled upon him. One could have imagined him thousands of years<br>old. I fired again into the same spot. At the second shot he did not<br>collapse but climbed with desperate slowness to his feet and stood weakly<br>upright, with legs sagging and head drooping. I fired a third time. That<br>was the shot that did for him. You could see the agony of it jolt his<br>whole body and knock the last remnant of strength from his legs. But in<br>falling he seemed for a moment to rise, for as his hind legs collapsed<br>beneath him he seemed to tower upward like a huge rock toppling, his<br>trunk reaching skyward like a tree. He trumpeted, for the first and only<br>time. And then down he came, his belly towards me, with a crash that<br>seemed to shake the ground even where I lay.<br><br>I got up. The Burmans were already racing past me across the mud. It was<br>obvious that the elephant would never rise again, but he was not dead. He<br>was breathing very rhythmically with long rattling gasps, his great mound<br>of a side painfully rising and falling. His mouth was wide open--I could<br>see far down into caverns of pale pink throat. I waited a long time for<br>him to die, but his breathing did not weaken. Finally I fired my two<br>remaining shots into the spot where I thought his heart must be. The<br>thick blood welled out of him like red velvet, but still he did not die.<br>His body did not even jerk when the shots hit him, the tortured breathing<br>continued without a pause. He was dying, very slowly and in great agony,<br>but in some world remote from me where not even a bullet could damage him<br>further. I felt that I had got to put an end to that dreadful noise. It<br>seemed dreadful to see the great beast Lying there, powerless to move and<br>yet powerless to die, and not even to be able to finish him. I sent back<br>for my small rifle and poured shot after shot into his heart and down his<br>throat. They seemed to make no impression. The tortured gasps continued<br>as steadily as the ticking of a clock.<br><br>In the end I could not stand it any longer and went away. I heard later<br>that it took him half an hour to die. Burmans were bringing dahs and<br>baskets even before I left, and I was told they had stripped his body<br>almost to the bones by the afternoon.<br><br>Afterwards, of course, there were endless discussions about the shooting<br>of the elephant. The owner was furious, but he was only an Indian and<br>could do nothing. Besides, legally I had done the right thing, for a mad<br>elephant has to be killed, like a mad dog, if its owner fails to control<br>it. Among the Europeans opinion was divided. The older men said I was<br>right, the younger men said it was a damn shame to shoot an elephant for<br>killing a coolie, because an elephant was worth more than any damn<br>Coringhee coolie. And afterwards I was very glad that the coolie had been<br>killed; it put me legally in the right and it gave me a sufficient<br>pretext for shooting the elephant. I often wondered whether any of the<br>others grasped that I had done it solely to avoid looking a fool.<br><br></font></p>
