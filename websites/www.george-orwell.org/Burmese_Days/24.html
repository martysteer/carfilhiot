<h2>Chapter 25</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">It was lucky that the padre should have been at Kyauktada, for he<br>was able, before catching the train on the following evening, to<br>read the burial service in due form and even to deliver a short<br>address on the virtues of the dead man. All Englishmen are<br>virtuous when they are dead. 'Accidental death' was the official<br>verdict (Dr Veraswami had proved with all his medico-legal skill<br>that the circumstances pointed to accident) and it was duly<br>inscribed upon the tombstone. Not that anyone believed it, of<br>course. Flory's real epitaph was the remark, very occasionally<br>uttered--for an Englishman who dies in Burma is so soon forgotten--<br>'Flory? Oh yes, he was a dark chap, with a birthmark. He shot<br>himself in Kyauktada in 1926. Over a girl, people said. Bloody<br>fool.' Probably no one, except Elizabeth, was much surprised at<br>what had happened. There is a rather large number of suicides<br>among the Europeans in Burma, and they occasion very little<br>surprise.<br><br>Flory's death had several results. The first and most important of<br>them was that Dr Veraswami was ruined, even as he had foreseen.<br>The glory of being a white man's friend--the one thing that had<br>saved him before--had vanished. Flory's standing with the other<br>Europeans had never been good, it is true; but he was after all a<br>white man, and his friendship conferred a certain prestige. Once<br>he was dead, the doctor's ruin was assured. U Po Kyin waited the<br>necessary time, and then struck again, harder than ever. It was<br>barely three months before he had fixed it in the head of every<br>European in Kyauktada that the doctor was an unmitigated scoundrel.<br>No public accusation was ever made against him--U Po Kyin was most<br>careful of that. Even Ellis would have been puzzled to say just<br>what scoundrelism the doctor had been guilty of; but still, it was<br>agreed that he was a scoundrel. By degrees, the general suspicion<br>of him crystallized in a single Burmese phrase--'shok de'.<br>Veraswami, it was said, was quite a clever little chap in his way--<br>quite a good doctor for a native--but he was THOROUGHLY shok de.<br>Shok de means, approximately, untrustworthy, and when a 'native'<br>official comes to be known as shok de, there is an end of him.<br><br>The dreaded nod and wink passed somewhere in high places, and<br>the doctor was reverted to the rank of Assistant Surgeon and<br>transferred to Mandalay General Hospital. He is still there, and<br>is likely to remain. Mandalay is rather a disagreeable town--it<br>is dusty and intolerably hot, and it is said to have five main<br>products all beginning with P, namely, pagodas, pariahs, pigs,<br>priests and prostitutes--and the routine-work of the hospital is a<br>dreary business. The doctor lives just outside the hospital<br>grounds in a little bake-house of a bungalow with a corrugated iron<br>fence round its tiny compound, and in the evenings he runs a<br>private clinic to supplement his reduced pay. He has joined a<br>second-rate club frequented by Indian pleaders. Its chief glory is<br>a single European member--a Glasgow electrician named Macdougall,<br>sacked from the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company for drunkenness, and now<br>making a precarious living out of a garage. Macdougall is a dull<br>lout, only interested in whisky and magnetos. The doctor, who will<br>never believe that a white man can be a fool, tries almost every<br>night to engage him in what he still calls 'cultured conversation';<br>but the results are very unsatisfying.<br><br>Ko S'la inherited four hundred rupees under Flory's will, and with<br>his family he set up a tea-shop in the bazaar. But the shop<br>failed, as it was bound to do with the two women fighting in it at<br>all hours, and Ko S'la and Ba Pe were obliged to go back to<br>service. Ko S'la was an accomplished servant. Besides the useful<br>arts of pimping, dealing with money-lenders, carrying master to bed<br>when drunk and making pick-me-ups known as prairie oysters on the<br>following morning, he could sew, darn, refill cartridges, attend to<br>a horse, press a suit, and decorate a dinner-table with wonderful,<br>intricate patterns of chopped leaves and dyed rice-grains. He was<br>worth fifty rupees a month. But he and Ba Pe had fallen into lazy<br>ways in Flory's service, and, they were sacked from one job after<br>another. They had a bad year of poverty, and little Ba Shin<br>developed a cough, and finally coughed himself to death one<br>stifling hot-weather night. Ko S'la is now a second boy to a<br>Rangoon rice-broker with a neurotic wife who makes unending kit-<br>kit, and Ba Pe is pani-wallah in the same house at sixteen rupees a<br>month. Ma Hla May is in a brothel in Mandalay. Her good looks are<br>all but gone, and her clients pay her only four annas and sometimes<br>kick her and beat her. Perhaps more bitterly than any of the<br>others, she regrets the good time when Flory was alive, and when<br>she had not the wisdom to put aside any of the money she extracted<br>from him.<br><br>U Po Kyin realized all his dreams except one. After the doctor's<br>disgrace, it was inevitable that U Po Kyin should be elected to the<br>Club, and elected he was, in spite of bitter protests from Ellis.<br>In the end the other Europeans came to be rather glad that they had<br>elected him, for he was a bearable addition to the Club. He did<br>not come too often, was ingratiating in his manner, stood drinks<br>freely, and developed almost at once into a brilliant bridge-<br>player. A few months later he was transferred from Kyauktada and<br>promoted. For a whole year, before his retirement, he officiated<br>as Deputy Commissioner, and during that year alone he made twenty<br>thousand rupees in bribes. A month after his retirement he was<br>summoned to a durbar in Rangoon, to receive the decoration that had<br>been awarded to him by the Indian Government.<br><br>It was an impressive scene, that durbar. On the platform, hung<br>with flags and flowers, sat the Governor, frock-coated, upon a<br>species of throne, with a bevy of aides-de-camp and secretaries<br>behind him. All round the hall, like glittering waxworks, stood<br>the tall, bearded sowars of the Governor's bodyguard, with pennoned<br>lances in their hands. Outside, a band was blaring at intervals.<br>The gallery was gay with the white ingyis and pink scarves of<br>Burmese ladies, and in the body of the hall a hundred men or more<br>were waiting to receive their decorations. There were Burmese<br>officials in blazing Mandalay pasos, and Indians in cloth-of-gold<br>pagris, and British officers in full-dress uniform with clanking<br>sword-scabbards, and old thugyis with their grey hair knotted<br>behind their heads and silver-hilted dahs slung from their<br>shoulders. In a high, clear voice a secretary was reading out the<br>list of awards, which varied from the C.I.E. to certificates of<br>honour in embossed silver cases. Presently U Po Kyin's turn came<br>and the secretary read from his scroll:<br><br>'To U Po Kyin, Deputy Assistant Commissioner, retired, for long and<br>loyal service and especially for his timely aid in crushing a most<br>dangerous rebellion in Kyauktada district'--and so on and so on.<br><br>Then two henchmen, placed there for the purpose hoisted U Po Kyin<br>upright, and he waddled to the platform, bowed as low as his belly<br>would permit, and was duly decorated and felicitated, while Ma Kin<br>and other supporters clapped wildly and fluttered their scarves<br>from the gallery.<br><br>U Po Kyin had done all that mortal man could do. It was time now<br>to be making ready for the next world--in short, to begin building<br>pagodas. But unfortunately, this was the very point at which his<br>plans went wrong. Only three days after the Governor's durbar,<br>before so much as a brick of those atoning pagodas had been laid, U<br>Po Kyin was stricken with apoplexy and died without speaking again.<br>There is no armour against fate. Ma Kin was heartbroken at the<br>disaster. Even if she had built the pagodas herself, it would have<br>availed U Po Kyin nothing; no merit can be acquired save by one's<br>own act. She suffers greatly to think of U Po Kyin where he must<br>be now--wandering in God knows what dreadful subterranean hell of<br>fire, and darkness, and serpents, and genii. Or even if he has<br>escaped the worst, his other fear has been realized, and he has<br>returned to the earth in the shape of a rat or a frog. Perhaps at<br>this very moment a snake is devouring him.<br><br>As to Elizabeth, things fell out better than she had expected.<br>After Flory's death Mrs Lackersteen, dropping all pretences for<br>once, said openly that there were no men in this dreadful place and<br>the only hope was to go and stay several months in Rangoon or<br>Maymyo. But she could not very well send Elizabeth to Rangoon or<br>Maymyo alone, and to go with her practically meant condemning Mr<br>Lackersteen to death from delirium tremens. Months passed, and the<br>rains reached their climax, and Elizabeth had just made up her mind<br>that she must go home after all, penniless and unmarried, when--Mr<br>Macgregor proposed to her. He had had it in his mind for a long<br>time; indeed, he had only been waiting for a decent interval to<br>elapse after Flory's death.<br><br>Elizabeth accepted him gladly. He was rather old, perhaps, but a<br>Deputy Commissioner is not to be despised--certainly he was a far<br>better match than Flory. They are very happy. Mr Macgregor was<br>always a good-hearted man, but he has grown more human and likeable<br>since his marriage. His voice booms less, and he has given up his<br>morning exercises. Elizabeth has grown mature surprisingly<br>quickly, and a certain hardness of manner that always belonged to<br>her has become accentuated. Her servants live in terror of her,<br>though she speaks no Burmese. She has an exhaustive knowledge of<br>the Civil List, gives charming little dinner-parties and knows how<br>to put the wives of subordinate officials in their places--in<br>short, she fills with complete success the position for which<br>Nature had designed her from the first, that of a burra memsahib. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/23.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center></font></p>
