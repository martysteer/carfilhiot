<h2>Chapter 2</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">At about the time when U Po Kyin began his morning's business, 'Mr<br>Porley' the timber merchant and friend of Dr Veraswami, was leaving<br>his house for the Club.<br><br>Flory was a man of about thirty-five, of middle height, not ill<br>made. He had very black, stiff hair growing low on his head, and<br>a cropped black moustache, and his skin, naturally sallow, was<br>discoloured by the sun. Not having grown fat or bald he did not<br>look older than his age, but his face was very haggard in spite of<br>the sunburn, with lank cheeks and a sunken, withered look round the<br>eyes. He had obviously not shaved this morning. He was dressed in<br>the usual white shirt, khaki drill shorts and stockings, but<br>instead of a topi he wore a battered Terai hat, cocked over one<br>eye. He carried a bamboo stick with a wrist-thong, and a black<br>cocker spaniel named Flo was ambling after him.<br><br>All these were secondary expressions, however. The first thing<br>that one noticed in Flory was a hideous birthmark stretching in a<br>ragged crescent down his left cheek, from the eye to the corner<br>of the mouth. Seen from the left side his face had a battered,<br>woebegone look, as though the birthmark had been a bruise--for it<br>was a dark blue in colour. He was quite aware of its hideousness.<br>And at all times, when he was not alone, there was a sidelongness<br>about his movements, as he manoeuvred constantly to keep the<br>birthmark out of sight.<br><br>Flory's house was at the top of the maidan, close to the edge of<br>the jungle. From the gate the maidan sloped sharply down, scorched<br>and khaki-coloured, with half a dozen dazzling white bungalows<br>scattered round it. All quaked, shivered in the hot air. There<br>was an English cemetery within a white wall half-way down the hill,<br>and near by a tiny tin-roofed church. Beyond that was the European<br>Club, and when one looked at the Club--a dumpy one-storey wooden<br>building--one looked at the real centre of the town. In any town<br>in India the European Club is the spiritual citadel, the real seat<br>of the British power, the Nirvana for which native officials and<br>millionaires pine in vain. It was doubly so in this case, for it<br>was the proud boast of Kyauktada Club that, almost alone of Clubs<br>in Burma, it had never admitted an Oriental to membership. Beyond<br>the Club, the Irrawaddy flowed huge and ochreous glittering like<br>diamonds in the patches that caught the sun; and beyond the river<br>stretched great wastes of paddy fields, ending at the horizon in a<br>range of blackish hills.<br><br>The native town, and the courts and the jail, were over to the<br>right, mostly hidden in green groves of peepul trees. The spire of<br>the pagoda rose from the trees like a slender spear tipped with<br>gold. Kyauktada was a fairly typical Upper Burma town, that had<br>not changed greatly between the days of Marco Polo and 1910, and<br>might have slept in the Middle Ages for a century more if it had<br>not proved a convenient spot for a railway terminus. In 1910 the<br>Government made it the headquarters of a district and a seat of<br>Progress--interpretable as a block of law courts, with their army<br>of fat but ravenous pleaders, a hospital, a school and one of those<br>huge, durable jails which the English have built everywhere between<br>Gibraltar and Hong Kong. The population was about four thousand,<br>including a couple of hundred Indians, a few score Chinese and<br>seven Europeans. There were also two Eurasians named Mr Francis<br>and Mr Samuel, the sons of an American Baptist missionary and a<br>Roman Catholic missionary respectively. The town contained no<br>curiosities of any kind, except an Indian fakir who had lived for<br>twenty years in a tree near the bazaar, drawing his food up in a<br>basket every morning.<br><br>Flory yawned as he came out of the gate. He had been half drunk<br>the night before, and the glare made him feel liverish. 'Bloody,<br>bloody hole!' he thought, looking down the hill. And, no one<br>except the dog being near, he began to sing aloud, 'Bloody, bloody,<br>bloody, oh, how thou art bloody' to the tune of 'Holy, holy, holy,<br>oh how Thou art holy ' as he walked down the hot red road, swishing<br>at the dried-up grasses with his stick. It was nearly nine o'clock<br>and the sun was fiercer every minute. The heat throbbed down on<br>one's head with a steady, rhythmic thumping, like blows from an<br>enormous bolster. Flory stopped at the Club gate, wondering<br>whether to go in or to go farther down the road and see Dr<br>Veraswami. Then he remembered that it was 'English mail day' and<br>the newspapers would have arrived. He went in, past the big tennis<br>screen, which was overgrown by a creeper with starlike mauve<br>flowers.<br><br>In the borders beside the path swaths of English flowers--phlox and<br>larkspur, hollyhock and petunia--not yet slain by the sun, rioted<br>in vast size and richness. The petunias were huge, like trees<br>almost. There was no lawn, but instead a shrubbery of native trees<br>and bushes--gold mohur trees like vast umbrellas of blood-red<br>bloom, frangipanis with creamy, stalkless flowers, purple<br>bougainvillea, scarlet hibiscus and the pink Chinese rose, bilious-<br>green crotons, feathery fronds of tamarind. The clash of colours<br>hurt one's eyes in the glare. A nearly naked mali, watering-can in<br>hand, was moving in the jungle of flowers like some large nectar-<br>sucking bird.<br><br>On the Club steps a sandy-haired Englishman, with a prickly<br>moustache, pale grey eyes too far apart, and abnormally thin calves<br>to his legs, was standing with his hands in the pockets of his<br>shorts. This was Mr Westfield, the District Superintendent of<br>Police. With a very bored air he was rocking himself backwards and<br>forwards on his heels and pouting his upper lip so that his<br>moustache tickled his nose. He greeted Flory with a slight<br>sideways movement of his head. His way of speaking was clipped and<br>soldierly, missing out every word that well could be missed out.<br>Nearly everything he said was intended for a joke, but the tone of<br>his voice was hollow and melancholy.<br><br>'Hullo, Flory me lad. Bloody awful morning, what?'<br><br>'We must expect it at this time of year, I suppose,' Flory said.<br>He had turned himself a little sideways, so that his birthmarked<br>cheek was away from Westfield.<br><br>'Yes, dammit. Couple of months of this coming. Last year we<br>didn't have a spot of rain till June. Look at that bloody sky,<br>not a cloud in it. Like one of those damned great blue enamel<br>saucepans. God! What'd you give to be in Piccadilly now, eh?'<br><br>'Have the English papers come?'<br><br>'Yes. Dear old Punch, Pink'un and Vie Parisienne. Makes you<br>homesick to read 'em, what? Let's come in and have a drink before<br>the ice all goes. Old Lackersteen's been fairly bathing in it.<br>Half pickled already.'<br><br>They went in, Westfield remarking in his gloomy voice, 'Lead on,<br>Macduff.' Inside, the Club was a teak-walled place smelling of<br>earth-oil, and consisting of only four rooms, one of which<br>contained a forlorn 'library' of five hundred mildewed novels, and<br>another an old and mangy billiard-table--this, however, seldom<br>used, for during most of the year hordes of flying beetles came<br>buzzing round the lamps and littered themselves over the cloth.<br>There were also a card-room and a 'lounge' which looked towards the<br>river, over a wide veranda; but at this time of day all the<br>verandas were curtained with green bamboo chicks. The lounge was<br>an unhomelike room, with coco-nut matting on the floor, and wicker<br>chairs and tables which were littered with shiny illustrated<br>papers. For ornament there were a number of 'Bonzo' pictures, and<br>the dusty skulls of sambhur. A punkah, lazily flapping, shook dust<br>into the tepid air.<br><br>There were three men in the room. Under the punkah a florid, fine-<br>looking, slightly bloated man of forty was sprawling across the<br>table with his head in his hands, groaning in pain. This was Mr<br>Lackersteen, the local manager of a timber firm. He had been badly<br>drunk the night before, and he was suffering for it. Ellis, local<br>manager of yet another company, was standing before the notice-<br>board studying some notice with a look of bitter concentration. He<br>was a tiny wiry-haired fellow with a pale, sharp-featured face and<br>restless movements. Maxwell, the acting Divisional Forest Officer,<br>was lying in one of the long chairs reading the Field, and<br>invisible except for two large-boned legs and thick downy forearms.<br><br>'Look at this naughty old man,' said Westfield, taking Mr<br>Lackersteen half affectionately by the shoulders and shaking him.<br>'Example to the young, what? There but for the grace of God and<br>all that. Gives you an idea what you'll be like at forty.'<br><br>Mr Lackersteen gave a groan which sounded like 'brandy'.<br><br>'Poor old chap,' said Westfield, 'regular martyr to booze, eh?<br>Look at it oozing out of his pores. Reminds me of the old colonel<br>who used to sleep without a mosquito net. They asked his servant<br>why and the servant said: "At night, master too drunk to notice<br>mosquitoes; in the morning, mosquitoes too drunk to notice master."<br>Look at him--boozed last night and then asking for more. Got a<br>little niece coming to stay with him, too. Due tonight, isn't she,<br>Lackersteen?'<br><br>'Oh, leave that drunken sot alone,' said Ellis without turning<br>round. He had a spiteful Cockney voice. Mr Lackersteen groaned<br>again, '---- the niece! Get me some brandy, for Christ's sake.'<br><br>'Good education for the niece, eh? Seeing uncle under the table<br>seven times a week. Hey, butler! Bringing brandy for Lackersteen<br>master!'<br><br>The butler, a dark, stout Dravidian with liquid, yellow-irised eyes<br>like those of a dog, brought the brandy on a brass tray. Flory and<br>Westfield ordered gin. Mr Lackersteen swallowed a few spoonfuls of<br>brandy and sat back in his chair, groaning in a more resigned way.<br>He had a beefy, ingenuous face, with a toothbrush moustache. He<br>was really a very simple-minded man, with no ambitions beyond<br>having what he called 'a good time'. His wife governed him by the<br>only possible method, namely, by never letting him out of her sight<br>for more than an hour or two. Only once, a year after they were<br>married, she had left him for a fortnight, and had returned<br>unexpectedly a day before her time, to find Mr Lackersteen, drunk,<br>supported on either side by a naked Burmese girl, while a third up-<br>ended a whisky bottle into his mouth. Since then she had watched<br>him, as he used to complain, 'like a cat over a bloody mousehole'.<br>However, he managed to enjoy quite a number of 'good times', though<br>they were usually rather hurried ones.<br><br>'My Christ, what a head I've got on me this morning,' he said.<br>'Call that butler again, Westfield. I've got to have another<br>brandy before my missus gets here. She says she's going to cut my<br>booze down to four pegs a day when our niece gets here. God rot<br>them both!' he added gloomily.<br><br>'Stop playing the fool, all of you, and listen to this,' said Ellis<br>sourly. He had a queer wounding way of speaking, hardly ever<br>opening his mouth without insulting somebody. He deliberately<br>exaggerated his Cockney accent, because of the sardonic tone it<br>gave to his words. 'Have you seen this notice of old Macgregor's?<br>A little nosegay for everyone. Maxwell, wake up and listen!'<br><br>Maxwell lowered the Field. He was a fresh-coloured blond youth of<br>not more than twenty-five or six--very young for the post he held.<br>With his heavy limbs and thick white eyelashes he reminded one of a<br>cart-horse colt. Ellis nipped the notice from the board with a<br>neat, spiteful little movement and began reading it aloud. It had<br>been posted by Mr Macgregor, who, besides being Deputy Commissioner,<br>was secretary of the Club.<br><br>'Just listen to this. "It has been suggested that as there are as<br>yet no Oriental members of this club, and as it is now usual to<br>admit officials of gazetted rank, whether native or European, to<br>membership of most European Clubs, we should consider the question<br>of following this practice in Kyauktada. The matter will be open<br>for discussion at the next general meeting. On the one hand it may<br>be pointed out"--oh, well, no need to wade through the rest of it.<br>He can't even write a notice without an attack of literary<br>diarrhoea. Anyway, the point's this. He's asking us to break all<br>our rules and take a dear little nigger-boy into this Club. DEAR Dr<br>Veraswami, for instance. Dr Very-slimy, I call him. That WOULD be<br>a treat, wouldn't it? Little pot-bellied niggers breathing garlic<br>in your face over the bridge-table. Christ, to think of it! We've<br>got to hang together and put our foot down on this at once. What<br>do you say, Westfield? Flory?'<br><br>Westfield shrugged his thin shoulders philosophically. He had sat<br>down at the table and lighted a black, stinking Burma cheroot.<br><br>'Got to put up with it, I suppose,' he said. 'B--s of natives are<br>getting into all the Clubs nowadays. Even the Pegu Club, I'm told.<br>Way this country's going, you know. We're about the last Club in<br>Burma to hold out against 'em.'<br><br>'We are; and what's more, we're damn well going to go on holding<br>out. I'll die in the ditch before I'll see a nigger in here.'<br>Ellis had produced a stump of pencil. With the curious air of<br>spite that some men can put into their tiniest action, he re-pinned<br>the notice on the board and pencilled a tiny, neat 'B. F.' against<br>Mr Macgregor's signature--'There, that's what I think of his idea.<br>I'll tell him so when he comes down. What do YOU say, Flory?'<br><br>Flory had not spoken all this time. Though by nature anything but<br>a silent man, he seldom found much to say in Club conversations.<br>He had sat down at the table and was reading G. K. Chesterton's<br>article in the London News, at the same time caressing Flo's head<br>with his left hand. Ellis, however, was one of those people who<br>constantly nag others to echo their own opinions. He repeated his<br>question, and Flory looked up, and their eyes met. The skin round<br>Ellis's nose suddenly turned so pale that it was almost grey. In<br>him it was a sign of anger. Without any prelude he burst into a<br>stream of abuse that would have been startling, if the others had<br>not been used to hearing something like it every morning.<br><br>'My God, I should have thought in a case like this, when it's a<br>question of keeping those black, stinking swine out of the only<br>place where we can enjoy ourselves, you'd have the decency to back<br>me up. Even if that pot-bellied greasy little sod of a nigger<br>doctor IS your best pal. _I_ don't care if you choose to pal up<br>with the scum of the bazaar. If it pleases you to go to<br>Veraswami's house and drink whisky with all his nigger pals, that's<br>your look-out. Do what you like outside the Club. But, by God,<br>it's a different matter when you talk of bringing niggers in here.<br>I suppose you'd like little Veraswami for a Club member, eh?<br>Chipping into our conversation and pawing everyone with his sweaty<br>hands and breathing his filthy garlic breath in our faces. By god,<br>he'd go out with my boot behind him if ever I saw his black snout<br>inside that door. Greasy, pot-bellied little--!' etc.<br><br>This went on for several minutes. It was curiously impressive,<br>because it was so completely sincere. Ellis really did hate<br>Orientals--hated them with a bitter, restless loathing as of<br>something evil or unclean. Living and working, as the assistant of<br>a timber firm must, in perpetual contact with the Burmese, he had<br>never grown used to the sight of a black face. Any hint of<br>friendly feeling towards an Oriental seemed to him a horrible<br>perversity. He was an intelligent man and an able servant of his<br>firm, but he was one of those Englishmen--common, unfortunately--<br>who should never be allowed to set foot in the East.<br><br>Flory sat nursing Flo's head in his lap, unable to meet Ellis's<br>eyes. At the best of times his birthmark made it difficult for him<br>to look people straight in the face. And when he made ready to<br>speak, he could feel his voice trembling--for it had a way of<br>trembling when it should have been firm; his features, too,<br>sometimes twitched uncontrollably.<br><br>'Steady on,' he said at last, sullenly and rather feebly. 'Steady<br>on. There's no need to get so excited. _I_ never suggested having<br>any native members in here.'<br><br>'Oh, didn't you? We all know bloody well you'd like to, though.<br>Why else do you go to that oily little babu's house every morning,<br>then? Sitting down at table with him as though he was a white man,<br>and drinking out of glasses his filthy black lips have slobbered<br>over--it makes me spew to think of it.'<br><br>'Sit down, old chap, sit down,' Westfield said. 'Forget it. Have<br>a drink on it. Not worth while quarrelling. Too hot.'<br><br>'My God,' said Ellis a little more calmly, taking a pace or two up<br>and down, 'my God, I don't understand you chaps. I simply don't.<br>Here's that old fool Macgregor wanting to bring a nigger into this<br>Club for no reason whatever, and you all sit down under it without<br>a word. Good God, what are we supposed to be doing in this<br>country? If we aren't going to rule, why the devil don't we clear<br>out? Here we are, supposed to be governing a set of damn black<br>swine who've been slaves since the beginning of history, and<br>instead of ruling them in the only way they understand, we go and<br>treat them as equals. And you silly b--s take it for granted.<br>There's Flory, makes his best pal a black babu who calls himself<br>a doctor because he's done two years at an Indian so-called<br>university. And you, Westfield, proud as Punch of your knock-<br>kneed, bribe-taking cowards of policemen. And there's Maxwell,<br>spends his time running after Eurasian tarts. Yes, you do,<br>Maxwell; I heard about your goings-on in Mandalay with some smelly<br>little bitch called Molly Pereira. I suppose you'd have gone and<br>married her if they hadn't transferred you up here? You all seem<br>to LIKE the dirty black brutes. Christ, I don't know what's come<br>over us all. I really don't.'<br><br>'Come on, have another drink,' said Westfield. 'Hey, butler! Spot<br>of beer before the ice goes, eh? Beer, butler!'<br><br>The butler brought some bottles of Munich beer. Ellis presently<br>sat down at the table with the others, and he nursed one of the<br>cool bottles between his small hands. His forehead was sweating.<br>He was sulky, but not in a rage any longer. At all times he was<br>spiteful and perverse, but his violent fits of rage were soon over,<br>and were never apologized for. Quarrels were a regular part of the<br>routine of Club life. Mr Lackersteen was feeling better and was<br>studying the illustrations in La Vie Parisienne. It was after nine<br>now, and the room, scented with the acrid smoke of Westfield's<br>cheroot, was stifling hot. Everyone's shirt stuck to his back with<br>the first sweat of the day. The invisible chokra who pulled the<br>punkah rope outside was falling asleep in the glare.<br><br>'Butler!' yelled Ellis, and as the butler appeared, 'go and wake<br>that bloody chokra up!'<br><br>'Yes, master.'<br><br>'And butler!'<br><br>'Yes, master?'<br><br>'How much ice have we got left?'<br><br>''Bout twenty pounds, master. Will only last today, I think. I<br>find it very difficult to keep ice cool now.'<br><br>'Don't talk like that, damn you--"I find it very difficult!" Have<br>you swallowed a dictionary? "Please, master, can't keeping ice<br>cool"--that's how you ought to talk. We shall have to sack this<br>fellow if he gets to talk English too well. I can't stick servants<br>who talk English. D'you hear, butler?'<br><br>'Yes, master,' said the butler, and retired.<br><br>'God! No ice till Monday,' Westfield said. 'You going back to the<br>jungle, Flory?'<br><br>'Yes. I ought to be there now. I only came in because of the<br>English mail.'<br><br>'Go on tour myself, I think. Knock up a spot of Travelling<br>Allowance. I can't stick my bloody office at this time of year.<br>Sitting there under the damned punkah, signing one chit after<br>another. Paper-chewing. God, how I wish the war was on again!'<br><br>'I'm going out the day after tomorrow,' Ellis said. 'Isn't that<br>damned padre coming to hold his service this Sunday? I'll take<br>care not to be in for that, anyway. Bloody knee-drill.'<br><br>'Next Sunday,' said Westfield. 'Promised to be in for it myself.<br>So's Macgregor. Bit hard on the poor devil of a padre, I must say.<br>Only gets here once in six weeks. Might as well get up a<br>congregation when he does come.'<br><br>'Oh, hell! I'd snivel psalms to oblige the padre, but I can't<br>stick the way these damned native Christians come shoving into our<br>church. A pack of Madrassi servants and Karen school-teachers.<br>And then those two yellow-bellies, Francis and Samuel--they call<br>themselves Christians too. Last time the padre was here they had<br>the nerve to come up and sit on the front pews with the white men.<br>Someone ought to speak to the padre about that. What bloody fools<br>we were ever to let those missionaries loose in this country!<br>Teaching bazaar sweepers they're as good as we are. "Please, sir,<br>me Christian same like master." Damned cheek.'<br><br>'How about that for a pair of legs?' said Mr Lackersteen, passing<br>La Vie Parisienne across. 'You know French, Flory; what's that<br>mean underneath? Christ, it reminds me of when I was in Paris, my<br>first leave, before I married. Christ, I wish I was there again!'<br><br>'Did you hear that one about "There was a young lady of Woking"?'<br>Maxwell said. He was rather a silent youth, but, like other<br>youths, he had an affection for a good smutty rhyme. He completed<br>the biography of the young lady of Woking, and there was a laugh.<br>Westfield replied with the young lady of Ealing who had a peculiar<br>feeling, and Flory came in with the young curate of Horsham who<br>always took every precaution. There was more laughter. Even Ellis<br>thawed and produced several rhymes; Ellis's jokes were always<br>genuinely witty, and yet filthy beyond measure. Everyone cheered<br>up and felt more friendly in spite of the heat. They had finished<br>the beer and were just going to call for another drink, when shoes<br>creaked on the steps outside. A booming voice, which made the<br>floorboards tingle, was saying jocosely:<br><br>'Yes, most distinctly humorous. I incorporated it in one of those<br>little articles of mine in Blackwood's, you know. I remember, too,<br>when I was stationed at Prome, another quite--ah--diverting<br>incident which--'<br><br>Evidently Mr Macgregor had arrived at the Club. Mr Lackersteen<br>exclaimed, 'Hell! My wife's there,' and pushed his empty glass as<br>far away from him as it would go. Mr Macgregor and Mrs Lackersteen<br>entered the lounge together.<br><br>Mr Macgregor was a large, heavy man, rather past forty, with a<br>kindly, puggy face, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles. His bulky<br>shoulders, and a trick he had of thrusting his head forward,<br>reminded one curiously of a turtle--the Burmans, in fact, nicknamed<br>him 'the tortoise'. He was dressed in a clean silk suit, which<br>already showed patches of sweat beneath the armpits. He greeted<br>the others with a humorous mock-salute, and then planted himself<br>before the notice-board, beaming, in the attitude of a schoolmaster<br>twiddling a cane behind his back. The good nature in his face was<br>quite genuine, and yet there was such a wilful geniality about him,<br>such a strenuous air of being off duty and forgetting his official<br>rank, that no one was ever quite at ease in his presence. His<br>conversation was evidently modelled on that of some facetious<br>schoolmaster or clergyman whom he had known in early life. Any<br>long word, any quotation, any proverbial expression figured in his<br>mind as a joke, and was introduced with a bumbling noise like 'er'<br>or 'ah', to make it clear that there was a joke coming. Mrs<br>Lackersteen was a woman of about thirty-five, handsome in a<br>contourless, elongated way, like a fashion plate. She had a<br>sighing, discontented voice. The others had all stood up when she<br>entered, and Mrs Lackersteen sank exhaustedly into the best chair<br>under the punkah, fanning herself with a slender hand like that of<br>a newt.<br><br>'Oh dear, this heat, this heat! Mr Macgregor came and fetched me<br>in his car. SO kind of him. Tom, that wretch of a rickshaw-man is<br>pretending to be ill again. Really, I think you ought to give him<br>a good thrashing and bring him to his senses. It's too terrible to<br>have to walk about in this sun every day.'<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen, unequal to the quarter-mile walk between her house<br>and the Club, had imported a rickshaw from Rangoon. Except for<br>bullock-carts and Mr Macgregor's car it was the only wheeled<br>vehicle in Kyauktada, for the whole district did not possess ten<br>miles of road. In the jungle, rather than leave her husband alone,<br>Mrs Lackersteen endured all the horrors of dripping tents,<br>mosquitoes and tinned food; but she made up for it by complaining<br>over trifles while in headquarters.<br><br>'Really I think the laziness of these servants is getting too<br>shocking,' she sighed. 'Don't you agree, Mr Macgregor? We seem<br>to have no AUTHORITY over the natives nowadays, with all these<br>dreadful Reforms, and the insolence they learn from the newspapers.<br>In some ways they are getting almost as bad as the lower classes at<br>home.'<br><br>'Oh, hardly as bad as that, I trust. Still, I am afraid there is<br>no doubt that the democratic spirit is creeping in, even here.'<br><br>'And such a short time ago, even just before the war, they were so<br>NICE and respectful! The way they salaamed when you passed them on<br>the road--it was really quite charming. I remember when we paid<br>our butler only twelve rupees a month, and really that man loved us<br>like a dog. And now they are demanding forty and fifty rupees, and<br>I find that the only way I can even KEEP a servant is to pay their<br>wages several months in arrears.'<br><br>'The old type of servant is disappearing,' agreed Mr Macgregor.<br>'In my young days, when one's butler was disrespectful, one sent<br>him along to the jail with a chit saying "Please give the bearer<br>fifteen lashes". Ah well, eheu fugaces! Those days are gone for<br>ever, I am afraid.'<br><br>'Ah, you're about right there,' said Westfield in his gloomy way.<br>'This country'll never be fit to live in again. British Raj is<br>finished if you ask me. Lost Dominion and all that. Time we<br>cleared out of it.'<br><br>Whereat there was a murmur of agreement from everyone in the room,<br>even from Flory, notoriously a Bolshie in his opinions, even from<br>young Maxwell, who had been barely three years in the country. No<br>Anglo-Indian will ever deny that India is going to the dogs, or<br>ever has denied it--for India, like Punch, never was what it was.<br><br>Ellis had meanwhile unpinned the offending notice from behind Mr<br>Macgregor's back, and he now held it out to him, saying in his sour<br>way:<br><br>'Here, Macgregor, we've read this notice, and we all think this<br>idea of electing a native to the Club is absolute--' Ellis was<br>going to have said 'absolute balls', but he remembered Mrs<br>Lackersteen's presence and checked himself--'is absolutely uncalled<br>for. After all, this Club is a place where we come to enjoy<br>ourselves, and we don't want natives poking about in here. We like<br>to think there's still one place where we're free of them. The<br>others all agree with me absolutely.'<br><br>He looked round at the others. 'Hear, hear!' said Mr Lackersteen<br>gruffly. He knew that his wife would guess that he had been<br>drinking, and he felt that a display of sound sentiment would<br>excuse him.<br><br>Mr Macgregor took the notice with a smile. He saw the 'B. F.'<br>pencilled against his name, and privately he thought Ellis's manner<br>very disrespectful, but he turned the matter off with a joke. He<br>took as great pains to be a good fellow at the Club as he did to<br>keep up his dignity during office hours. 'I gather,' he said,<br>'that our friend Ellis does not welcome the society of--ah--his<br>Aryan brother?'<br><br>'No, I do not,' said Ellis tartly. 'Nor my Mongolian brother. I<br>don't like niggers, to put it in one word.'<br><br>Mr Macgregor stiffened at the word 'nigger', which is discountenanced<br>in India. He had no prejudice against Orientals; indeed, he was<br>deeply fond of them. Provided they were given no freedom he thought<br>them the most charming people alive. It always pained him to see<br>them wantonly insulted.<br><br>'Is it quite playing the game,' he said stiffly, 'to call these<br>people niggers--a term they very naturally resent--when they are<br>obviously nothing of the kind? The Burmese are Mongolians, the<br>Indians are Aryans or Dravidians, and all of them are quite<br>distinct--'<br><br>'Oh, rot that!' said Ellis, who was not at all awed by Mr<br>Macgregor's official status. 'Call them niggers or Aryans or what<br>you like. What I'm saying is that we don't want to see any black<br>hides in this Club. If you put it to the vote you'll find we're<br>against it to a man--unless Flory wants his DEAR pal Veraswami,' he<br>added.<br><br>'Hear, hear!' repeated Mr Lackersteen. 'Count on me to blackball<br>the lot of 'em.'<br><br>Mr Macgregor pursed his lips whimsically. He was in an awkward<br>position, for the idea of electing a native member was not his own,<br>but had been passed on to him by the Commissioner. However, he<br>disliked making excuses, so he said in a more conciliatory tone:<br><br>'Shall we postpone discussing it till the next general meeting? In<br>the meantime we can give it our mature consideration. And now,' he<br>added, moving towards the table, 'who will join me in a little--ah--<br>liquid refreshment?'<br><br>The butler was called and the 'liquid refreshment' ordered. It was<br>hotter than ever now, and everyone was thirsty. Mr Lackersteen was<br>on the point of ordering a drink when he caught his wife's eye,<br>shrank up and said sulkily 'No.' He sat with his hands on his<br>knees, with a rather pathetic expression, watching Mrs Lackersteen<br>swallow a glass of lemonade with gin in it. Mr Macgregor, though<br>he signed the chit for drinks, drank plain lemonade. Alone of the<br>Europeans in Kyauktada, he kept the rule of not drinking before<br>sunset.<br><br>'It's all very well,' grumbled Ellis, with his forearms on the<br>table, fidgeting with his glass. The dispute with Mr Macgregor had<br>made him restless again. 'It's all very well, but I stick to what<br>I said. No natives in this Club! It's by constantly giving way<br>over small things like that that we've ruined the Empire. The<br>country's only rotten with sedition because we've been too soft<br>with them. The only possible policy is to treat 'em like the dirt<br>they are. This is a critical moment, and we want every bit of<br>prestige we can get. We've got to hang together and say, "WE ARE<br>THE MASTERS, and you beggars--"' Ellis pressed his small thumb down<br>as though flattening a grub--'"you beggars keep your place!"'<br><br>'Hopeless, old chap,' said Westfield. 'Quite hopeless. What can<br>you do with all this red tape tying your hands? Beggars of natives<br>know the law better than we do. Insult you to your face and then<br>run you in the moment you hit 'em. Can't do anything unless you<br>put your foot down firmly. And how can you, if they haven't the<br>guts to show fight?'<br><br>'Our burra sahib at Mandalay always said,' put in Mrs Lackersteen,<br>'that in the end we shall simply LEAVE India. Young men will not<br>come out here any longer to work all their lives for insults and<br>ingratitude. We shall just GO. When the natives come to us<br>begging us to stay, we shall say, "No, you have had your chance,<br>you wouldn't take it. Very well, we shall leave you to govern<br>yourselves." And then, what a lesson that will teach them!'<br><br>'It's all this law and order that's done for us,' said Westfield<br>gloomily. The ruin of the Indian Empire through too much legality<br>was a recurrent theme with Westfield. According to him, nothing<br>save a full-sized rebellion, and the consequent reign of martial<br>law, could save the Empire from decay. 'All this paper-chewing and<br>chit-passing. Office babus are the real rulers of this country<br>now. Our number's up. Best thing we can do is to shut up shop and<br>let 'em stew in their own juice.'<br><br>'I don't agree, I simply don't agree,' Ellis said. 'We could put<br>things right in a month if we chose. It only needs a pennyworth of<br>pluck. Look at Amritsar. Look how they caved in after that. Dyer<br>knew the stuff to give them. Poor old Dyer! That was a dirty job.<br>Those cowards in England have got something to answer for.'<br><br>There was a kind of sigh from the others, the same sigh that a<br>gathering of Roman Catholics will give at the mention of Bloody<br>Mary. Even Mr Macgregor, who detested bloodshed and martial law,<br>shook his head at the name of Dyer.<br><br>'Ah, poor man! Sacrificed to the Paget M.P.s. Well, perhaps they<br>will discover their mistake when it is too late.'<br><br>'My old governor used to tell a story about that,' said Westfield.<br>'There was an old havildar in a native regiment--someone asked him<br>what'd happen if the British left India. The old chap said--'<br><br>Flory pushed back his chair and stood up. It must not, it could<br>not--no, it simply should not go on any longer! He must get out of<br>this room quickly, before something happened inside his head and he<br>began to smash the furniture and throw bottles at the pictures.<br>Dull boozing witless porkers! Was it possible that they could go<br>on week after week, year after year, repeating word for word the<br>same evil-minded drivel, like a parody of a fifth-rate story in<br>Blackwood's? Would none of them EVER think of anything new to say?<br>Oh, what a place, what people! What a civilization is this of<br>ours--this godless civilization founded on whisky, Blackwood's and<br>the 'Bonzo' pictures! God have mercy on us, for all of us are part<br>of it.<br><br>Flory did not say any of this, and he was at some pains not to show<br>it in his face. He was standing by his chair, a little sidelong to<br>the others, with the half-smile of a man who is never sure of his<br>popularity.<br><br>'I'm afraid I shall have to be off,' he said. 'I've got some<br>things to see to before breakfast, unfortunately.'<br><br>'Stay and have another spot, old man,' said Westfield. 'Morning's<br>young. Have a gin. Give you an appetite.'<br><br>'No, thanks, I must be going. Come on, Flo. Good-bye, Mrs<br>Lackersteen. Good-bye, everybody.'<br><br>'Exit Booker Washington, the niggers' pal,' said Ellis as Flory<br>disappeared. Ellis could always be counted on to say something<br>disagreeable about anyone who had just left the room. 'Gone to see<br>Very-slimy, I suppose. Or else sloped off to avoid paying a round<br>of drinks.'<br><br>'Oh, he's not a bad chap,' Westfield said. 'Says some Bolshie<br>things sometimes. Don't suppose he means half of them.'<br><br>'Oh, a very good fellow, of course,' said Mr Macgregor. Every<br>European in India is ex-officio, or rather ex-colore, a good<br>fellow, until he has done something quite outrageous. It is an<br>honorary rank.<br><br>'He's a bit TOO Bolshie for my taste. I can't bear a fellow who<br>pals up with the natives. I shouldn't wonder if he's got a lick of<br>the tar-brush himself. It might explain that black mark on his<br>face. Piebald. And he looks like a yellow-belly, with that black<br>hair, and skin the colour of a lemon.'<br><br>There was some desultory scandal about Flory, but not much, because<br>Mr Macgregor did not like scandal. The Europeans stayed in the<br>Club long enough for one more round of drinks. Mr Macgregor told<br>his anecdote about Prome, which could be produced in almost any<br>context. And then the conversation veered back to the old, never-<br>palling subject--the insolence of the natives, the supineness of<br>the Government, the dear dead days when the British Raj WAS the<br>British Raj and please give the bearer fifteen lashes. This topic<br>was never let alone for long, partly because of Ellis's obsession.<br>Besides, you could forgive the Europeans a great deal of their<br>bitterness. Living and working among Orientals would try the<br>temper of a saint. And all of them, the officials particularly,<br>knew what it was to be baited and insulted. Almost every day, when<br>Westfield or Mr Macgregor or even Maxwell went down the street, the<br>High School boys, with their young, yellow faces--faces smooth as<br>gold coins, full of that maddening contempt that sits so naturally<br>on the Mongolian face--sneered at them as they went past, sometimes<br>hooted after them with hyena-like laughter. The life of the Anglo-<br>Indian officials is not all jam. In comfortless camps, in<br>sweltering offices, in gloomy dakbungalows smelling of dust and<br>earth-oil, they earn, perhaps, the right to be a little disagreeable.<br><br>It was getting on for ten now, and hot beyond bearing. Flat, clear<br>drops of sweat gathered on everyone's face, and on the men's bare<br>forearms. A damp patch was growing larger and larger in the back<br>of Mr Macgregor's silk coat. The glare outside seemed to soak<br>somehow through the green-chicked windows, making one's eyes ache<br>and filling one's head with stuffiness. Everyone thought with<br>malaise of his stodgy breakfast, and of the long, deadly hours that<br>were coming. Mr Macgregor stood up with a sigh and adjusted his<br>spectacles, which had slipped down his sweating nose.<br><br>'Alas that such a festive gathering should end,' he said. 'I must<br>get home to breakfast. The cares of Empire. Is anybody coming my<br>way? My man is waiting with the car.'<br><br>'Oh, thank you,' said Mrs Lackersteen; 'if you'd take Tom and me.<br>What a relief not to have to walk in this heat!'<br><br>The others stood up. Westfield stretched his arms and yawned<br>through his nose. 'Better get a move on, I suppose. Go to sleep<br>if I sit here any longer. Think of stewing in that office all day!<br>Baskets of papers. Oh Lord!'<br><br>'Don't forget tennis this evening, everyone,' said Ellis.<br>'Maxwell, you lazy devil, don't you skulk out of it again. Down<br>here with your racquet at four-thirty sharp.'<br><br>'Apres vous, madame,' said Mr Macgregor gallantly, at the door.<br><br>'Lead on, Macduff,' said Westfield.<br><br>They went out into the glaring white sunlight. The heat rolled<br>from the earth like the breath of an oven. The flowers, oppressive<br>to the eyes, blazed with not a petal stirring, in a debauch of sun.<br>The glare sent a weariness through one's bones. There was<br>something horrible in it--horrible to think of that blue, blinding<br>sky, stretching on and on over Burma and India, over Siam,<br>Cambodia, China, cloudless and interminable. The plates of Mr<br>Macgregor's waiting car were too hot to touch. The evil time of<br>day was beginning, the time, as the Burmese say, 'when feet are<br>silent'. Hardly a living creature stirred, except men, and the<br>black columns of ants, stimulated by the heat, which marched<br>ribbon-like across the path, and the tail-less vultures which<br>soared on the currents of the air.<br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/0.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/2.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
