<h2>Chapter 7</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Elizabeth lay on the sofa in the Lackersteen's drawing-room, with<br>her feet up and a cushion behind her head, reading Michael Arlen's<br>These Charming People. In a general way Michael Arlen was her<br>favourite author, but she was inclined to prefer William J. Locke<br>when she wanted something serious.<br><br>The drawing-room was a cool, light-coloured room with lime-washed<br>walls a yard thick; it was large, but seemed smaller than it was,<br>because of a litter of occasional tables and Benares brassware<br>ornaments. It smelt of chintz and dying flowers. Mrs Lackersteen<br>was upstairs, sleeping. Outside, the servants lay silent in their<br>quarters, their heads tethered to their wooden pillows by the<br>death-like sleep of midday. Mr Lackersteen, in his small wooden<br>office down the road, was probably sleeping too. No one stirred<br>except Elizabeth, and the chokra who pulled the punkah outside Mrs<br>Lackersteen's bedroom, lying on his back with one heel in the loop<br>of the rope.<br><br>Elizabeth was just turned twenty-two, and was an orphan. Her<br>father had been less of a drunkard than his brother Tom, but he was<br>a man of similar stamp. He was a tea-broker, and his fortunes<br>fluctuated greatly, but he was by nature too optimistic to put<br>money aside in prosperous phases. Elizabeth's mother had been an<br>incapable, half-baked, vapouring, self-pitying woman who shirked<br>all the normal duties of life on the strength of sensibilities<br>which she did not possess. After messing about for years with such<br>things as Women's Suffrage and Higher Thought, and making many<br>abortive attempts at literature, she had finally taken up with<br>painting. Painting is the only art that can be practised without<br>either talent or hard work. Mrs Lackersteen's pose was that of an<br>artist exiled among 'the Philistines'--these, needless to say,<br>included her husband--and it was a pose that gave her almost<br>unlimited scope for making a nuisance of herself.<br><br>In the last year of the War Mr Lackersteen, who had managed to<br>avoid service, made a great deal of money, and just after the<br>Armistice they moved into a huge, new, rather bleak house in<br>Highgate, with quantities of greenhouses, shrubberies, stables and<br>tennis courts. Mr Lackersteen had engaged a horde of servants,<br>even, so great was his optimism, a butler. Elizabeth was sent for<br>two terms to a very expensive boarding-school. Oh, the joy, the<br>joy, the unforgettable joy of those two terms! Four of the girls<br>at the school were 'the Honourable'; nearly all of them had ponies<br>of their own, on which they were allowed to go riding on Saturday<br>afternoons. There is a short period in everyone's life when his<br>character is fixed forever; with Elizabeth, it was those two terms<br>during which she rubbed shoulders with the rich. Thereafter her<br>whole code of living was summed up in one belief, and that a simple<br>one. It was that the Good ('lovely' was her name for it) is<br>synonymous with the expensive, the elegant, the aristocratic; and<br>the Bad ('beastly') is the cheap, the low, the shabby, the<br>laborious. Perhaps it is in order to teach this creed that<br>expensive girls' schools exist. The feeling subtilized itself as<br>Elizabeth grew older, diffused itself through all her thoughts.<br>Everything from a pair of stockings to a human soul was<br>classifiable as 'lovely' or 'beastly'. And unfortunately--for Mr<br>Lackersteen's prosperity did not last--it was the 'beastly' that<br>had predominated in her life.<br><br>The inevitable crash came late in 1919. Elizabeth was taken away<br>from school, to continue her education at a succession of cheap,<br>beastly schools, with gaps of a term or two when her father could<br>not pay the fees. He died when she was twenty, of influenza. Mrs<br>Lackersteen was left with an income of L150 a year, which was to<br>die with her. The two women could not, under Mrs Lackersteen's<br>management, live on three pounds a week in England. They moved to<br>Paris, where life was cheaper and where Mrs Lackersteen intended to<br>dedicate herself wholly to Art.<br><br>Paris! Living in Paris! Flory had been a little wide of the mark<br>when he pictured those interminable conversations with bearded<br>artists under the green plane trees. Elizabeth's life in Paris had<br>not been quite like that.<br><br>Her mother had taken a studio in the Montparnasse quarter, and<br>relapsed at once into a state of squalid, muddling idleness. She<br>was so foolish with money that her income would not come near<br>covering expenses, and for several months Elizabeth did not even<br>have enough to eat. Then she found a job as visiting teacher of<br>English to the family of a French bank manager. They called her<br>'notre mees Anglaise'. The banker lived in the twelfth<br>arrondissement, a long way from Montparnasse, and Elizabeth had<br>taken a room in a pension near by. It was a narrow, yellow-faced<br>house in a side street, looking out on to a poulterer's shop,<br>generally decorated with reeking carcasses of wild boars, which old<br>gentlemen like decrepit satyrs would visit every morning and sniff<br>long and lovingly. Next door to the poulterer's was a fly-blown<br>cafe with the sign 'Cafe de l'Amitie. Bock Formidable'. How<br>Elizabeth had loathed that pension! The patroness was an old<br>black-clad sneak who spent her life in tiptoeing up and down stairs<br>in hopes of catching the boarders washing stockings in their hand-<br>basins. The boarders, sharp-tongued bilious widows, pursued the<br>only man in the establishment, a mild, bald creature who worked in<br>La Samaritaine, like sparrows worrying a bread-crust. At meals all<br>of them watched each others' plates to see who was given the<br>biggest helping. The bathroom was a dark den with leprous walls<br>and a rickety verdigrised geyser which would spit two inches of<br>tepid water into the bath and then mulishly stop working. The bank<br>manager whose children Elizabeth taught was a man of fifty, with a<br>fat, worn face and a bald, dark yellow crown resembling an<br>ostrich's egg. The second day after her arrival he came into the<br>room where the children were at their lessons, sat down beside<br>Elizabeth and immediately pinched her elbow. The third day he<br>pinched her on the calf, the fourth day behind the knee, the fifth<br>day above the knee. Thereafter, every evening, it was a silent<br>battle between the two of them, her hand under the table, struggling<br>and struggling to keep that ferret-like hand away from her.<br><br>It was a mean, beastly existence. In fact, it reached levels of<br>'beastliness' which Elizabeth had not previously known to exist.<br>But the thing that most depressed her, most filled her with the<br>sense of sinking into some horrible lower world, was her mother's<br>studio. Mrs Lackersteen was one of those people who go utterly to<br>pieces when they are deprived of servants. She lived in a restless<br>nightmare between painting and housekeeping, and never worked at<br>either. At irregular intervals she went to a 'school' where she<br>produced greyish still-lifes under the guidance of a master whose<br>technique was founded on dirty brushes; for the rest, she messed<br>about miserably at home with teapots and frying-pans. The state of<br>her studio was more than depressing to Elizabeth; it was evil,<br>Satanic. It was a cold, dusty pigsty, with piles of books and<br>papers littered all over the floor, generations of saucepans<br>slumbering in their grease on the rusty gas-stove, the bed never<br>made till afternoon, and everywhere--in every possible place where<br>they could be stepped on or knocked over--tins of paint-fouled<br>turpentine and pots half full of cold black tea. You would lift a<br>cushion from a chair and find a plate holding the remains of a<br>poached egg underneath it. As soon as Elizabeth entered the door<br>she would burst out:<br><br>'Oh, Mother, Mother dearest, how CAN you? Look at the state of<br>this room! It is so terrible to live like this!'<br><br>'The room, dearest? What's the matter? Is it untidy?'<br><br>'Untidy! Mother, NEED you leave that plate of porridge in the<br>middle of your bed? And those saucepans! It does look so<br>dreadful. Suppose anyone came in!'<br><br>The rapt, other-wordly look which Mrs Lackersteen assumed when<br>anything like work presented itself, would come into her eyes.<br><br>'None of MY friends would mind, dear. We are such Bohemians, we<br>artists. You don't understand how utterly wrapped up we all are in<br>our painting. You haven't the artistic temperament, you see,<br>dear.'<br><br>'I must try and clean some of those saucepans. I just can't bear<br>to think of you living like this. What have you done with the<br>scrubbing-brush?'<br><br>'The scrubbing-brush? Now, let me think, I know I saw it somewhere.<br>Ah yes! I used it yesterday to clean my palette. But it'll be<br>all right if you give it a good wash in turpentine.'<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen would sit down and continue smudging a sheet of<br>sketching paper with a Conte crayon while Elizabeth worked.<br><br>'How wonderful you are, dear. So practical! I can't think whom<br>you inherit it from. Now with me, Art is simply EVERYTHING. I<br>seem to feel it like a great sea surging up inside me. It swamps<br>everything mean and petty out of existence. Yesterday I ate my<br>lunch off Nash's Magazine to save wasting time washing plates.<br>Such a good idea! When you want a clean plate you just tear off a<br>sheet,' etc., etc., etc.<br><br>Elizabeth had no friends in Paris. Her mother's friends were women<br>of the same stamp as herself, or elderly ineffectual bachelors<br>living on small incomes and practising contemptible half-arts such<br>as wood-engraving or painting on porcelain. For the rest,<br>Elizabeth saw only foreigners, and she disliked all foreigners en<br>bloc; or at least all foreign men, with their cheap-looking clothes<br>and their revolting table manners. She had one great solace at<br>this time. It was to go to the American library in the rue de<br>l'Elysee and look at the illustrated papers. Sometimes on a Sunday<br>or her free afternoon she would sit there for hours at the big<br>shiny table, dreaming, over the Sketch, the Tatter, the Graphic,<br>the Sporting and Dramatic.<br><br>Ah, what joys were pictured there! 'Hounds meeting on the lawn of<br>Charlton Hall, the lovely Warwickshire seat of Lord Burrowdean.'<br>'The Hon. Mrs Tyke-Bowlby in the Park with her splendid Alsatian,<br>Kublai Khan, which took second prize at Cruft's this summer.'<br>'Sunbathing at Cannes. Left to right: Miss Barbara Pilbrick, Sir<br>Edward Tuke, Lady Pamela Westrope, Captain "Tuppy" Benacre.'<br><br>Lovely, lovely, golden world! On two occasions the face of an old<br>schoolfellow looked at Elizabeth from the page. It hurt her in her<br>breast to see it. There they all were, her old schoolfellows, with<br>their horses and their cars and their husbands in the cavalry; and<br>here she, tied to that dreadful job, that dreadful pension, her<br>dreadful mother! Was it possible that there was no escape? Could<br>she be doomed forever to this sordid meanness, with no hope of ever<br>getting back to the decent world again?<br><br>It was not unnatural, with the example of her mother before her<br>eyes, that Elizabeth should have a healthy loathing of Art. In<br>fact, any excess of intellect--'braininess' was her word for it--<br>tended to belong, in her eyes, to the 'beastly'. Real people, she<br>felt, decent people--people who shot grouse, went to Ascot, yachted<br>at Cowes--were not brainy. They didn't go in for this nonsense of<br>writing books and fooling with paintbrushes; and all these Highbrow<br>ideas--Socialism and all that. 'Highbrow' was a bitter word in her<br>vocabulary. And when it happened, as it did once or twice, that<br>she met a veritable artist who was willing to work penniless all<br>his life, rather than sell himself to a bank or an insurance<br>company, she despised him far more than she despised the dabblers<br>of her mother's circle. That a man should turn deliberately away<br>from all that was good and decent, sacrifice himself for a futility<br>that led nowhere, was shameful, degrading, evil. She dreaded<br>spinsterhood, but she would have endured it a thousand lifetimes<br>through rather than marry such a man.<br><br>When Elizabeth had been nearly two years in Paris her mother died<br>abruptly of ptomaine poisoning. The wonder was that she had not<br>died of it sooner. Elizabeth was left with rather less than a<br>hundred pounds in the world. Her uncle and aunt cabled at once<br>from Burma, asking her to come out and stay with them, and saying<br>that a letter would follow.<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen had reflected for some time over the letter, her<br>pen between her lips, looking down at the page with her delicate<br>triangular face like a meditative snake.<br><br>'I suppose we must have her out here, at any rate for a year. WHAT<br>a bore! However, they generally marry within a year if they've any<br>looks at all. What am I to say to the girl, Tom?'<br><br>'Say? Oh, just say she'll pick up a husband out here a damn sight<br>easier than at home. Something of that sort, y'know.'<br><br>'My DEAR Tom! What impossible things you say!'<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen wrote:<br><br><br>Of course, this is a very small station and we are in the jungle a<br>great deal of the time. I'm afraid you will find it dreadfully<br>dull after the DELIGHTS of Paris. But really in some ways these<br>small stations have their advantages for a young girl. She finds<br>herself quite a QUEEN in the local society. The unmarried men are<br>so lonely that they appreciate a girl's society in a quite<br>wonderful way, etc., etc.<br><br><br>Elizabeth spent thirty pounds on summer frocks and set sail<br>immediately. The ship, heralded by rolling porpoises, ploughed<br>across the Mediterranean and down the Canal into a sea of staring,<br>enamel-like blue, then out into the green wastes of the Indian<br>Ocean, where flocks of flying fish skimmed in terror from the<br>approaching hull. At night the waters were phosphorescent, and<br>the wash of the bow was like a moving arrowhead of green fire.<br>Elizabeth 'loved' the life on board ship. She loved the dancing on<br>deck at nights, the cocktails which every man on board seemed<br>anxious to buy for her, the deck games, of which, however, she grew<br>tired at about the same time as the other members of the younger<br>set. It was nothing to her that her mother's death was only two<br>months past. She had never cared greatly for her mother, and<br>besides, the people here knew nothing of her affairs. It was so<br>lovely after those two graceless years to breathe the air of wealth<br>again. Not that most of the people here were rich; but on board<br>ship everyone behaves as though he were rich. She was going to<br>love India, she knew. She had formed quite a picture of India,<br>from the other passengers' conversation; she had even learned some<br>of the more necessary Hindustani phrases, such as 'idher ao',<br>'jaldi', 'sahiblog', etc. In anticipation she tasted the agreeable<br>atmosphere of Clubs, with punkahs flapping and barefooted white-<br>turbaned boys reverently salaaming; and maidans where bronzed<br>Englishmen with little clipped moustaches galloped to and fro,<br>whacking polo balls. It was almost as nice as being really rich,<br>the way people lived in India.<br><br>They sailed into Colombo through green glassy waters, where turtles<br>and black snakes floated basking. A fleet of sampans came racing<br>out to meet the ship, propelled by coal-black men with lips stained<br>redder than blood by betel juice. They yelled and struggled round<br>the gangway while the passengers descended. As Elizabeth and her<br>friends came down, two sampan-wallahs, their prows nosing against<br>the gangway, besought them with yells.<br><br>'Don't you go with him, missie! Not with him! Bad wicked man he,<br>not fit taking missie!'<br><br>'Don't you listen him lies, missie! Nasty low fellow! Nasty low<br>tricks him playing. Nasty NATIVE tricks!'<br><br>'Ha, ha! He is not native himself! Oh no! Him European man,<br>white skin all same, missie! Ha ha!'<br><br>'Stop your bat, you two, or I'll fetch one of you a kick,' said the<br>husband of Elizabeth's friend--he was a planter. They stepped into<br>one of the sampans and were rowed towards the sun-bright quays.<br>And the successful sampan-wallah turned and discharged at his rival<br>a mouthful of spittle which he must have been saving up for a very<br>long time.<br><br>This was the Orient. Scents of coco-nut oil and sandalwood,<br>cinnamon and turmeric, floated across the water on the hot,<br>swimming air. Elizabeth's friends drove her out to Mount Lavinia,<br>where they bathed in a lukewarm sea that foamed like Coca-Cola.<br>She came back to the ship in the evening, and they reached Rangoon<br>a week later.<br><br>North of Mandalay the train, fuelled with wood, crawled at twelve<br>miles an hour across a vast, parched plain, bounded at its remote<br>edges by blue rings of hills. White egrets stood poised,<br>motionless, like herons, and piles of drying chilis gleamed crimson<br>in the sun. Sometimes a white pagoda rose from the plain like the<br>breast of a supine giantess. The early tropic night settled down,<br>and the train jolted on, slowly, stopping at little stations where<br>barbaric yells sounded from the darkness. Half-naked men with<br>their long hair knotted behind their heads moved to and fro in<br>torchlight, hideous as demons in Elizabeth's eyes. The train<br>plunged into forest, and unseen branches brushed against the<br>windows. It was about nine o'clock when they reached Kyauktada,<br>where Elizabeth's uncle and aunt were waiting with Mr Macgregor's<br>car, and with some servants carrying torches. Her aunt came<br>forward and took Elizabeth's shoulders in her delicate, saurian<br>hands.<br><br>'I suppose you are our niece Elizabeth? We are SO pleased to see<br>you,' she said, and kissed her.<br><br>Mr Lackersteen peered over his wife's shoulder in the torchlight.<br>He gave a half-whistle, exclaimed, 'Well, I'll be damned!' and then<br>seized Elizabeth and kissed her, more warmly than he need have<br>done, she thought. She had never seen either of them before.<br><br>After dinner, under the punkah in the drawing-room, Elizabeth and<br>her aunt had a talk together. Mr Lackersteen was strolling in the<br>garden, ostensibly to smell the frangipani, actually to have a<br>surreptitious drink that one of the servants smuggled to him from<br>the back of the house.<br><br>'My dear, how really lovely you are! Let me look at you again.'<br>She took her by the shoulders. 'I DO think that Eton crop suits<br>you. Did you have it done in Paris?'<br><br>'Yes. Everyone was getting Eton-cropped. It suits you if you've<br>got a fairly small head.'<br><br>'Lovely! And those tortoise-shell spectacles--such a becoming<br>fashion! I'm told that all the--er--demi-mondaines in South<br>America have taken to wearing them. I'd no idea I had such a<br>RAVISHING beauty for a niece. How old did you say you were, dear?'<br><br>'Twenty-two.'<br><br>'Twenty-two! How delighted all the men will be when we take you to<br>the Club tomorrow! They get so lonely, poor things, never seeing a<br>new face. And you were two whole years in Paris? I can't think<br>what the men there can have been about to let you leave unmarried.'<br><br>'I'm afraid I didn't meet many men, Aunt. Only foreigners. We had<br>to live so quietly. And I was working,' she added, thinking this<br>rather a disgraceful admission.<br><br>'Of course, of course,' sighed Mrs Lackersteen. 'One hears the<br>same thing on every side. Lovely girls having to work for their<br>living. It is such a shame! I think it's so terribly selfish,<br>don't you, the way these men remain unmarried while there are so<br>MANY poor girls looking for husbands?' Elizabeth not answering<br>this, Mrs Lackersteen added with another sigh, 'I'm sure if I were<br>a young girl I'd marry anybody, literally ANYBODY!'<br><br>The two women's eyes met. There was a great deal that Mrs<br>Lackersteen wanted to say, but she had no intention of doing more<br>than hint at it obliquely. A great deal of her conversation was<br>carried on by hints; she generally contrived, however, to make her<br>meaning reasonably clear. She said in a tenderly impersonal tone,<br>as though discussing a subject of general interest:<br><br>'Of course, I must say this. There ARE cases when, if girls fail<br>to get married it's THEIR OWN FAULT. It happens even out here<br>sometimes. Only a short time ago I remember a case--a girl came<br>out and stayed a whole year with her brother, and she had offers<br>from all kinds of men--policemen, forest officers, men in timber<br>firms with QUITE good prospects. And she refused them all; she<br>wanted to marry into the I.C.S., I heard. Well, what do you<br>expect? Of course her brother couldn't go on keeping her forever.<br>And now I hear she's at home, poor thing, working as a kind of lady<br>help, practically a SERVANT. And getting only fifteen shillings a<br>week! Isn't it dreadful to think of such things?'<br><br>'Dreadful!' Elizabeth echoed.<br><br>No more was said on this subject. In the morning, after she came<br>back from Flory's house, Elizabeth was describing her adventure to<br>her aunt and uncle. They were at breakfast, at the flower-laden<br>table, with the punkah flapping overhead and the tall stork-like<br>Mohammedan butler in his white suit and pagri standing behind Mrs<br>Lackersteen's chair, tray in hand.<br><br>'And oh, Aunt, such an interesting thing! A Burmese girl came on<br>to the veranda. I'd never seen one before, at least, not knowing<br>they were girls. Such a queer little thing--she was almost like a<br>doll with her round yellow face and her black hair screwed up on<br>top. She only looked about seventeen. Mr Flory said she was his<br>laundress.'<br><br>The Indian butler's long body stiffened. He squinted down at the<br>girl with his white eyeballs large in his black face. He spoke<br>English well. Mr Lackersteen paused with a forkful of fish half-<br>way from his plate and his crass mouth open.<br><br>'Laundress?' he said. 'Laundress! I say, dammit, some mistake<br>there! No such thing as a laundress in this country, y'know.<br>Laundering work's all done by men. If you ask me--'<br><br>And then he stopped very suddenly, almost as though someone had<br>trodden on his toe under the table. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/5.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/7.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
