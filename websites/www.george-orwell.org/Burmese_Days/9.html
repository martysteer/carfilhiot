<h2>Chapter 10</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">But as a matter of fact, Ko S'la's alarm was premature. After<br>knowing Elizabeth for ten days, Flory was scarcely more intimate<br>with her than on the day when he had first met her.<br><br>As it happened, he had her almost to himself during these ten days,<br>most of the Europeans being in the jungle. Flory himself had no<br>right to be loitering in headquarters, for at this time of year the<br>work of timber-extraction was in full swing, and in his absence<br>everything went to pieces under the incompetent Eurasian overseer.<br>But he had stayed--pretext, a touch of fever--while despairing<br>letters came almost every day from the overseer, telling of<br>disasters. One of the elephants was ill, the engine of the light<br>railway that was used for carrying teak logs to the river had<br>broken down, fifteen of the coolies had deserted. But Flory still<br>lingered, unable to tear himself away from Kyauktada while<br>Elizabeth was there, and continually seeking--never, as yet, to<br>much purpose--to recapture that easy and delightful friendship of<br>their first meeting.<br><br>They met every day, morning and evening, it was true. Each evening<br>they played a single of tennis at the Club--Mrs Lackersteen was too<br>limp and Mr Lackersteen too liverish for tennis at this time of<br>year--and afterwards they would sit in the lounge, all four<br>together, playing bridge and talking. But though Flory spent hours<br>in Elizabeth's company, and often they were alone together, he was<br>never for an instant at his ease with her. They talked--so long as<br>they talked of trivialities--with the utmost freedom, yet they were<br>distant, like strangers. He felt stiff in her presence, he could<br>not forget his birthmark; his twice-scraped chin smarted, his body<br>tortured him for whisky and tobacco--for he tried to cut down his<br>drinking and smoking when he was with her. After ten days they<br>seemed no nearer the relationship he wanted.<br><br>For somehow, he had never been able to talk to her as he longed to<br>talk. To talk, simply to talk! It sounds so little, and how much<br>it is! When you have existed to the brink of middle age in bitter<br>loneliness, among people to whom your true opinion on every subject<br>on earth is blasphemy, the need to talk is the greatest of all<br>needs. Yet with Elizabeth serious talk seemed impossible. It was<br>as though there had been a spell upon them that made all their<br>conversation lapse into banality; gramophone records, dogs, tennis<br>racquets--all that desolating Club-chatter. She seemed not to WANT<br>to talk of anything but that. He had only to touch upon a subject<br>of any conceivable interest to hear the evasion, the 'I shan't<br>play', coming into her voice. Her taste in books appalled him when<br>he discovered it. Yet she was young, he reminded himself, and had<br>she not drunk white wine and talked of Marcel Proust under the<br>Paris plane trees? Later, no doubt, she would understand him and<br>give him the companionship he needed. Perhaps it was only that he<br>had not won her confidence yet.<br><br>He was anything but tactful with her. Like all men who have lived<br>much alone, he adjusted himself better to ideas than to people.<br>And so, though all their talk was superficial, he began to irritate<br>her sometimes; not by what he said but by what he implied. There<br>was an uneasiness between them, ill-defined and yet often verging<br>upon quarrels. When two people, one of whom has lived long in the<br>country while the other is a newcomer, are thrown together, it is<br>inevitable that the first should act as cicerone to the second.<br>Elizabeth, during these days, was making her first acquaintance<br>with Burma; it was Flory, naturally, who acted as her interpreter,<br>explaining this, commenting upon that. And the things he said, or<br>the way he said them, provoked in her a vague yet deep disagreement.<br>For she perceived that Flory, when he spoke of the 'natives', spoke<br>nearly always IN FAVOUR of them. He was forever praising Burmese<br>customs and the Burmese character; he even went so far as to<br>contrast them favourably with the English. It disquieted her.<br>After all, natives were natives--interesting, no doubt, but finally<br>only a 'subject' people, an inferior people with black faces. His<br>attitude was a little TOO tolerant. Nor had he grasped, yet, in<br>what way he was antagonizing her. He so wanted her to love Burma as<br>he loved it, not to look at it with the dull, incurious eyes of a<br>memsahib! He had forgotten that most people can be at ease in a<br>foreign country only when they are disparaging the inhabitants.<br><br>He was too eager in his attempts to interest her in things<br>Oriental. He tried to induce her, for instance, to learn Burmese,<br>but it came to nothing. (Her aunt had explained to her that only<br>missionary-women spoke Burmese; nice women found kitchen Urdu quite<br>as much as they needed.) There were countless small disagreements<br>like that. She was grasping, dimly, that his views were not the<br>views an Englishman should hold. Much more clearly she grasped<br>that he was asking her to be fond of the Burmese, even to admire<br>them; to admire people with black faces, almost savages, whose<br>appearance still made her shudder!<br><br>The subject cropped up in a hundred ways. A knot of Burmans would<br>pass them on the road. She, with her still fresh eyes, would gaze<br>after them, half curious and half repelled; and she would say to<br>Flory, as she would have said to anybody:<br><br>'How REVOLTINGLY ugly these people are, aren't they?'<br><br>'ARE they? I always think they're rather charming-looking, the<br>Burmese. They have such splendid bodies! Look at that fellow's<br>shoulders--like a bronze statue. Just think what sights you'd see<br>in England if people went about half naked as they do here!'<br><br>'But they have such hideous-shaped heads! Their skulls kind of<br>slope up behind like a tom-cat's. And then the way their foreheads<br>slant back--it makes them look so WICKED. I remember reading<br>something in a magazine about the shape of people's heads; it said<br>that a person with a sloping forehead is a CRIMINAL TYPE.'<br><br>'Oh, come, that's a bit sweeping! Round about half the people in<br>the world have that kind of forehead.'<br><br>'Oh, well, if you count COLOURED people, of course--!'<br><br>Or perhaps a string of women would pass, going to the well: heavy-<br>set peasant-girls, copper-brown, erect under their water-pots with<br>strong marelike buttocks protruded. The Burmese women repelled<br>Elizabeth more than the men; she felt her kinship with them, and<br>the hatefulness of being kin to creatures with black faces.<br><br>'Aren't they too simply dreadful? So COARSE-LOOKING; like some<br>kind of animal. Do you think ANYONE could think those women<br>attractive?'<br><br>'Their own men do, I believe.'<br><br>'I suppose they would. But that black skin--I don't know how<br>anyone could bear it!'<br><br>'But, you know, one gets used to the brown skin in time. In fact<br>they say--I believe it's true--that after a few years in these<br>countries a brown skin seems more natural than a white one. And<br>after all, it IS more natural. Take the world as a whole, it's an<br>eccentricity to be white.'<br><br>'You DO have some funny ideas!'<br><br>And so on and so on. She felt all the while an unsatisfactoriness,<br>an unsoundness in the things he said. It was particularly so on<br>the evening when Flory allowed Mr Francis and Mr Samuel, the two<br>derelict Eurasians, to entrap him in conversation at the Club gate.<br><br>Elizabeth, as it happened, had reached the Club a few minutes<br>before Flory, and when she heard his voice at the gate she came<br>round the tennis-screen to meet him. The two Eurasians had sidled<br>up to Flory and cornered him like a pair of dogs asking for a game.<br>Francis was doing most of the talking. He was a meagre, excitable<br>man, and as brown as a cigar-leaf, being the son of a South Indian<br>woman; Samuel, whose mother had been a Karen, was pale yellow with<br>dull red hair. Both were dressed in shabby drill suits, with vast<br>topis beneath which their slender bodies looked like the stalks of<br>toadstools.<br><br>Elizabeth came down the path in time to hear fragments of an<br>enormous and complicated autobiography. Talking to white men--<br>talking, for choice, about himself--was the great joy of Francis's<br>life. When, at intervals of months, he found a European to listen<br>to him, his life-history would pour out of him in unquenchable<br>torrents. He was talking in a nasal, sing-song voice of incredible<br>rapidity:<br><br>'Of my father, sir, I remember little, but he was very choleric man<br>and many whackings with big bamboo stick all knobs on both for<br>self, little half-brother and two mothers. Also how on occasion of<br>bishop's visit little half-brother and I dress in longyis and sent<br>among the Burmese children to preserve incognito. My father never<br>rose to be bishop, sir. Four converts only in twenty-eight years,<br>and also too great fondness for Chinese rice-spirit very fiery<br>noised abroad and spoil sales of my father's booklet entitled The<br>Scourge of Alcohol, published with the Rangoon Baptist Press, one<br>rupee eight annas. My little half-brother die one hot weather,<br>always coughing, coughing,' etc., etc.<br><br>The two Eurasians perceived the presence of Elizabeth. Both doffed<br>their topis with bows and brilliant displays of teeth. It was<br>probably several years since either of them had had a chance of<br>talking to an Englishwoman. Francis burst out more effusively than<br>ever. He was chattering in evident dread that he would be<br>interrupted and the conversation cut short.<br><br>'Good evening to you, madam, good evening, good evening! Most<br>honoured to make your acquaintance, madam! Very sweltering is the<br>weather these days, is not? But seasonable for April. Not too<br>much you are suffering from prickly heat, I trust? Pounded<br>tamarind applied to the afflicted spot is infallible. Myself I<br>suffer torments each night. Very prevalent disease among we<br>Europeans.'<br><br>He pronounced it Europian, like Mr Chollop in Martin Chuzzlewit.<br>Elizabeth did not answer. She was looking at the Eurasians<br>somewhat coldly. She had only a dim idea as to who or what they<br>were, and it struck her as impertinent that they should speak to<br>her.<br><br>'Thanks, I'll remember about the tamarind,' Flory said.<br><br>'Specific of renowned Chinese doctor, sir. Also, sir-madam, may I<br>advise to you, wearing only Terai hat is not judicious in April,<br>sir. For the natives all well, their skulls are adamant. But for<br>us sunstroke ever menaces. Very deadly is the sun upon European<br>skull. But is it that I detain you, madam?'<br><br>This was said in a disappointed tone. Elizabeth had, in fact,<br>decided to snub the Eurasians. She did not know why Flory was<br>allowing them to hold him in conversation. As she turned away to<br>stroll back to the tennis court, she made a practice stroke in the<br>air with her racquet, to remind Flory that the game was overdue.<br>He saw it and followed her, rather reluctantly, for he did not like<br>snubbing the wretched Francis, bore though he was.<br><br>'I must be off,' he said. 'Good evening, Francis. Good evening,<br>Samuel.'<br><br>'Good evening, sir! Good evening, madam! Good evening, good<br>evening!' They receded with more hat flourishes.<br><br>'Who ARE those two?' said Elizabeth as Flory came up with her.<br>'Such extraordinary creatures! They were in church on Sunday. One<br>of them looks almost white. Surely he isn't an Englishman?'<br><br>'No, they're Eurasians--sons of white fathers and native mothers.<br>Yellow-bellies is our friendly nickname for them.'<br><br>'But what are they doing here? Where do they live? Do they do any<br>work?'<br><br>'They exist somehow or other in the bazaar. I believe Francis acts<br>as clerk to an Indian money-lender, and Samuel to some of the<br>pleaders. But they'd probably starve now and then if it weren't<br>for the charity of the natives.'<br><br>'The natives! Do you mean to say--sort of CADGE from the natives?'<br><br>'I fancy so. It would be a very easy thing to do, if one cared to.<br>The Burmese won't let anyone starve.'<br><br>Elizabeth had never heard of anything of this kind before. The<br>notion of men who were at least partly white living in poverty<br>among 'natives' so shocked her that she stopped short on the path,<br>and the game of tennis was postponed for a few minutes.<br><br>'But how awful! I mean, it's such a bad example! It's almost as<br>bad as if one of US was like that. Couldn't something be done for<br>those two? Get up a subscription and send them away from here, or<br>something?'<br><br>'I'm afraid it wouldn't help much. Wherever they went they'd be in<br>the same position.'<br><br>'But couldn't they get some proper work to do?'<br><br>'I doubt it. You see, Eurasians of that type--men who've been<br>brought up in the bazaar and had no education--are done for from<br>the start. The Europeans won't touch them with a stick, and<br>they're cut off from entering the lower-grade Government services.<br>There's nothing they can do except cadge, unless they chuck all<br>pretension to being Europeans. And really you can't expect the<br>poor devils to do that. Their drop of white blood is the sole<br>asset they've got. Poor Francis, I never meet him but he begins<br>telling me about his prickly heat. Natives, you see, are supposed<br>not to suffer from prickly heat--bosh, of course, but people<br>believe it. It's the same with sunstroke. They wear those huge<br>topis to remind you that they've got European skulls. A kind of<br>coat of arms. The bend sinister, you might say.'<br><br>This did not satisfy Elizabeth. She perceived that Flory, as<br>usual, had a sneaking sympathy with the Eurasians. And the<br>appearance of the two men had excited a peculiar dislike in her.<br>She had placed their type now. They looked like dagoes. Like<br>those Mexicans and Italians and other dago people who play the<br>mauvais role in so many a film.<br><br>'They looked awfully degenerate types, didn't they? So thin and<br>weedy and cringing; and they haven't got at all HONEST faces. I<br>suppose these Eurasians ARE very degenerate? I've heard that half-<br>castes always inherit what's worst in both races. Is that true?'<br><br>'I don't know that it's true. Most Eurasians aren't very good<br>specimens, and it's hard to see how they could be, with their<br>upbringing. But our attitude towards them is rather beastly. We<br>always talk of them as though they'd sprung up from the ground like<br>mushrooms, with all their faults ready-made. But when all's said<br>and done, we're responsible for their existence.'<br><br>'Responsible for their existence?'<br><br>'Well, they've all got fathers, you see.'<br><br>'Oh . . . Of course there's that. . . . But after all, YOU aren't<br>responsible. I mean, only a very low kind of man would--er--have<br>anything to do with native women, wouldn't he?'<br><br>'Oh, quite. But the fathers of both those two were clergymen in<br>holy orders, I believe.'<br><br>He thought of Rosa McFee, the Eurasian girl he had seduced in<br>Mandalay in 1913. The way he used to sneak down to the house in a<br>gharry with the shutters down; Rosa's corkscrew curls; her withered<br>old Burmese mother, giving him tea in the dark living-room with the<br>fern pots and the wicker divan. And afterwards, when he had<br>chucked Rosa, those dreadful, imploring letters on scented note-<br>paper, which, in the end, he had ceased opening.<br><br>Elizabeth reverted to the subject of Francis and Samuel after<br>tennis.<br><br>'Those two Eurasians--does anyone here have anything to do with<br>them? Invite them to their houses or anything?'<br><br>'Good gracious, no. They're complete outcasts. It's not<br>considered quite the thing to talk to them, in fact. Most of us<br>say good morning to them--Ellis won't even do that.'<br><br>'But YOU talked to them.'<br><br>'Oh well, I break the rules occasionally. I meant that a pukka<br>sahib probably wouldn't be seen talking to them. But you see, I<br>try--just sometimes, when I have the pluck--NOT to be a pukka<br>sahib.'<br><br>It was an unwise remark. She knew very well by this time the<br>meaning of the phrase 'pukka sahib' and all it stood for. His<br>remark had made the difference in their viewpoint a little clearer.<br>The glance she gave him was almost hostile, and curiously hard; for<br>her face could look hard sometimes, in spite of its youth and its<br>flower-like skin. Those modish tortoise-shell spectacles gave her<br>a very self-possessed look. Spectacles are queerly expressive<br>things--almost more expressive, indeed, than eyes.<br><br>As yet he had neither understood her nor quite won her trust. Yet<br>on the surface, at least, things had not gone ill between them. He<br>had fretted her sometimes, but the good impression that he had made<br>that first morning was not yet effaced. It was a curious fact that<br>she scarcely noticed his birthmark at this time. And there were<br>some subjects on which she was glad to hear him talk. Shooting,<br>for example--she seemed to have an enthusiasm for shooting that was<br>remarkable in a girl. Horses, also; but he was less knowledgeable<br>about horses. He had arranged to take her out for a day's<br>shooting, later, when he could make preparations. Both of them<br>were looking forward to the expedition with some eagerness, though<br>not entirely for the same reason. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/8.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/10.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
