<h2>Chapter 15</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2"><br>When Flory arrived at the Club he found the Lackersteens in an<br>unusually morose mood. Mrs Lackersteen was sitting, as usual, in<br>the best place under the punkah, and was reading the Civil List,<br>the Debrett of Burma. She was in a bad temper with her husband,<br>who had defied her by ordering a 'large peg' as soon as he reached<br>the Club, and was further defying her by reading the Pink'un.<br>Elizabeth was alone in the stuffy little library, turning over the<br>pages of an old copy of Blackwood's.<br><br>Since parting with Flory, Elizabeth had had a very disagreeable<br>adventure. She had come out of her bath and was half-way through<br>dressing for dinner when her uncle had suddenly appeared in her<br>room--pretext, to hear some more about the day's shooting--and<br>begun pinching her leg in a way that simply could not be<br>misunderstood. Elizabeth was horrified. This was her first<br>introduction to the fact that some men are capable of making love<br>to their nieces. We live and learn. Mr Lackersteen had tried to<br>carry the thing off as a joke, but he was too clumsy and too nearly<br>drunk to succeed. It was fortunate that his wife was out of<br>hearing, or there might have been a first-rate scandal.<br><br>After this, dinner was an uncomfortable meal. Mr Lackersteen was<br>sulking. What rot it was, the way these women put on airs and<br>prevented you from having a good time! The girl was pretty enough<br>to remind him of the Illustrations in La Vie Parisienne, and damn<br>it! wasn't he paying for her keep? It was a shame. But for<br>Elizabeth the position was very serious. She was penniless and had<br>no home except her uncle's house. She had come eight thousand<br>miles to stay here. It would be terrible if after only a fortnight<br>her uncle's house were to be made uninhabitable for her.<br><br>Consequently, one thing was much surer in her mind than it had<br>been: that if Flory asked her to marry him (and he would, there was<br>little doubt of it), she would say yes. At another time it was<br>just possible that she would have decided differently. This<br>afternoon, under the spell of that glorious, exciting, altogether<br>'lovely' adventure, she had come near to loving Flory; as near as,<br>in his particular case, she was able to come. Yet even after that,<br>perhaps, her doubts would have returned. For there had always been<br>something dubious about Flory; his age, his birthmark, his queer,<br>perverse way of talking--that 'highbrow' talk that was at once<br>unintelligible and disquieting. There had been days when she had<br>even disliked him. But now her uncle's behaviour had turned the<br>scale. Whatever happened she had got to escape from her uncle's<br>house, and that soon. Yes, undoubtedly she would marry Flory when<br>he asked her!<br><br>He could see her answer in her face as he came into the library.<br>Her air was gentler, more yielding than he had known it. She was<br>wearing the same lilac-coloured frock that she had worn that first<br>morning when he met her, and the sight of the familiar frock gave<br>him courage. It seemed to bring her nearer to him, taking away the<br>strangeness and the elegance that had sometimes unnerved him.<br><br>He picked up the magazine she had been reading and made some<br>remark; for a moment they chattered in the banal way they so seldom<br>managed to avoid. It is strange how the drivelling habits of<br>conversation will persist into almost all moments. Yet even as<br>they chattered they found themselves drifting to the door and then<br>outside, and presently to the big frangipani tree by the tennis<br>court. It was the night of the full moon. Flaring like a white-<br>hot coin, so brilliant that it hurt one's eyes, the moon swam<br>rapidly upwards in a sky of smoky blue, across which drifted a few<br>wisps of yellowish cloud. The stars were all invisible. The<br>croton bushes, by day hideous things like jaundiced laurels, were<br>changed by the moon into jagged black and white designs like<br>fantastic wood-cuts. By the compound fence two Dravidian coolies<br>were walking down the road, transfigured, their white rags<br>gleaming. Through the tepid air the scent streamed from the<br>frangipani trees like some intolerable compound out of a penny-in-<br>the-slot machine.<br><br>'Look at the moon, just look at it!' Flory said. 'It's like a<br>white sun. It's brighter than an English winter day.'<br><br>Elizabeth looked up into the branches of the frangipani tree, which<br>the moon seemed to have changed into rods of silver. The light lay<br>thick, as though palpable, on everything, crusting the earth and<br>the rough bark of trees like some dazzling salt, and every leaf<br>seemed to bear a freight of solid light, like snow. Even<br>Elizabeth, indifferent to such things, was astonished.<br><br>'It's wonderful! You never see moonlight like that at Home. It's<br>so--so--' No adjective except 'bright' presenting itself, she was<br>silent. She had a habit of leaving her sentences unfinished, like<br>Rosa Dartle, though for a different reason.<br><br>'Yes, the old moon does her best in this country. How that tree<br>does stink, doesn't it? Beastly, tropical thing! I hate a tree<br>that blooms all the year round, don't you?'<br><br>He was talking half abstractedly, to cover the time till the<br>coolies should be out of sight. As they disappeared he put his arm<br>round Elizabeth's shoulder, and then, when she did not start or<br>speak, turned her round and drew her against him. Her head came<br>against his breast, and her short hair grazed his lips. He put his<br>hand under her chin and lifted her face up to meet his. She was<br>not wearing her spectacles.<br><br>'You don't mind?'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'I mean, you don't mind my--this thing of mine?' he shook his head<br>slightly to indicate the birthmark. He could not kiss her without<br>first asking this question.<br><br>'No, no. Of course not.'<br><br>A moment after their mouths met he felt her bare arms settle<br>lightly round his neck. They stood pressed together, against the<br>smooth trunk of the frangipani tree, body to body, mouth to mouth,<br>for a minute or more. The sickly scent of the tree came mingling<br>with the scent of Elizabeth's hair. And the scent gave him a<br>feeling of stultification, of remoteness from Elizabeth, even<br>though she was in his arms. All that that alien tree symbolized<br>for him, his exile, the secret, wasted years--it was like an<br>unbridgeable gulf between them. How should he ever make her<br>understand what it was that he wanted of her? He disengaged<br>himself and pressed her shoulders gently against the tree, looking<br>down at her face, which he could see very clearly though the moon<br>was behind her.<br><br>'It's useless trying to tell you what you mean to me,' he said.<br>'"What you mean to me!" These blunted phrases! You don't know,<br>you can't know, how much I love you. But I've got to try and tell<br>you. There's so much I must tell you. Had we better go back to<br>the Club? They may come looking for us. We can talk on the<br>veranda.'<br><br>'Is my hair very untidy?' she said.<br><br>'It's beautiful.'<br><br>'But has it got untidy? Smooth it for me, would you, please?'<br><br>She bent her head towards him, and he smoothed the short, cool<br>locks with his hand. The way she bent her head to him gave him a<br>curious feeling of intimacy, far more intimate than the kiss, as<br>though he had already been her husband. Ah, he must have her, that<br>was certain! Only by marrying her could his life be salvaged. In<br>a moment he would ask her. They walked slowly through the cotton<br>bushes and back to the Club, his arm still round her shoulder.<br><br>'We can talk on the veranda,' he repeated. 'Somehow, we've never<br>really talked, you and I. My God, how I've longed all these years<br>for somebody to talk to! How I could talk to you, interminably,<br>interminably! That sounds boring. I'm afraid it will be boring.<br>I must ask you to put up with it for a little while.'<br><br>She made a sound of remonstrance at the word 'boring'.<br><br>'No, it is boring, I know that. We Anglo-Indians are always looked<br>on as bores. And we ARE bores. But we can't help it. You see,<br>there's--how shall I say?--a demon inside us driving us to talk.<br>We walk about under a load of memories which we long to share and<br>somehow never can. It's the price we pay for coming to this<br>country.'<br><br>They were fairly safe from interruption on the side veranda, for<br>there was no door opening directly upon it. Elizabeth had sat down<br>with her arms on the little wicker table, but Flory remained<br>strolling back and forth, with his hands in his coatpockets,<br>stepping into the moonlight that streamed beneath the eastern eaves<br>of the veranda, and back into the shadows.<br><br>'I said just now that I loved you. Love! The word's been used<br>till it's meaningless. But let me try to explain. This afternoon<br>when you were there shooting with me, I thought, my God! here at<br>last is somebody who can share my life with me, but really share<br>it, really LIVE it with me--do you see--'<br><br>He was going to ask her to marry him--indeed, he had intended to<br>ask her without more delay. But the words were not spoken yet;<br>instead, he found himself talking egoistically on and on. He could<br>not help it. It was so important that she should understand<br>something of what his life in this country had been; that she<br>should grasp the nature of the loneliness that he wanted her to<br>nullify. And it was so devilishly difficult to explain. It is<br>devilish to suffer from a pain that is all but nameless. Blessed<br>are they who are stricken only with classifiable diseases! Blessed<br>are the poor, the sick, the crossed in love, for at least other<br>people know what is the matter with them and will listen to their<br>belly-achings with sympathy. But who that has not suffered it<br>understands the pain of exile? Elizabeth watched him as he moved<br>to and fro, in and out of the pool of moonlight that turned his<br>silk coat to silver. Her heart was still knocking from the kiss,<br>and yet her thoughts wandered as he talked. Was he going to ask<br>her to marry him? He was being so slow about it! She was dimly<br>aware that he was saying something about loneliness. Ah, of<br>course! He was telling her about the loneliness she would have to<br>put up with in the jungle, when they were married. He needn't have<br>troubled. Perhaps you did get rather lonely in the jungle<br>sometimes? Miles from anywhere, no cinemas, no dances, no one but<br>each other to talk to, nothing to do in the evenings except read--<br>rather a bore, that. Still, you could have a gramophone. What a<br>difference it would make when those new portable radio sets got out<br>to Burma! She was about to say this when he added:<br><br>'Have I made myself at all clear to you? Have you got some picture<br>of the life we live here? The foreignness, the solitude, the<br>melancholy! Foreign trees, foreign flowers, foreign landscapes,<br>foreign faces. It's all as alien as a different planet. But do<br>you see--and it's this that I so want you to understand--do you<br>see, it mightn't be so bad living on a different planet, it might<br>even be the most interesting thing imaginable, if you had even one<br>person to share it with. One person who could see it with eyes<br>something like your own. This country's been a kind of solitary<br>hell to me--it's so to most of us--and yet I tell you it could<br>be a paradise if one weren't alone. Does all this seem quite<br>meaningless?'<br><br>He had stopped beside the table, and he picked up her hand. In the<br>half-darkness he could see her face only as a pale oval, like a<br>flower, but by the feeling of her hand he knew instantly that she<br>had not understood a word of what he was saying. How should she,<br>indeed? It was so futile, this meandering talk! He would say to<br>her at once, Will you marry me? Was there not a lifetime to talk<br>in? He took her other hand and drew her gently to her feet.<br><br>'Forgive me all this rot I've been talking.'<br><br>'It's all right,' she murmured indistinctly, expecting that he was<br>about to kiss her.<br><br>'No, it's rot talking like that. Some things will go into words,<br>some won't. Besides, it was an impertinence to go belly-aching on<br>and on about myself. But I was trying to lead up to something.<br>Look, this is what I wanted to say. Will--'<br><br>'Eliz-a-beth!'<br><br>It was Mrs Lackersteen's high-pitched, plaintive voice, calling<br>from within the Club.<br><br>'Elizabeth? Where are you, Elizabeth?'<br><br>Evidently she was near the front door--would be on the veranda in a<br>moment. Flory pulled Elizabeth against him. They kissed hurriedly.<br>He released her, only holding her hands.<br><br>'Quickly, there's just time. Answer me this. Will you--'<br><br>But that sentence never got any further. At the same moment<br>something extraordinary happened under his feet--the floor was<br>surging and rolling like a sea--he was staggering, then dizzily<br>falling, hitting his upper arm a thump as the floor rushed towards<br>him. As he lay there he found himself jerked violently backwards<br>and forwards as though some enormous beast below were rocking the<br>whole building on its back.<br><br>The drunken floor righted itself very suddenly, and Flory sat up,<br>dazed but not much hurt. He dimly noticed Elizabeth sprawling<br>beside him, and screams coming from within the Club. Beyond the<br>gate two Burmans were racing through the moonlight with their long<br>hair streaming behind them. They were yelling at the top of their<br>voices:<br><br>'Nga Yin is shaking himself! Nga Yin is shaking himself!'<br><br>Flory watched them unintelligently. Who was Nga Yin? Nga is the<br>prefix given to criminals. Nga Yin must be a dacoit. Why was he<br>shaking himself? Then he remembered. Nga Yin was a giant supposed<br>by the Burmese to be buried, like Typhaeus, beneath the crust of<br>the earth. Of course! It was an earthquake.<br><br>'An earthquake!' he exclaimed, and he remembered Elizabeth and<br>moved to pick her up. But she was already sitting up, unhurt, and<br>rubbing the back of her head.<br><br>'Was that an earthquake?' she said in a rather awed voice.<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen's tall form came creeping round the corner of the<br>veranda, clinging to the wall like some elongated lizard. She was<br>exclaiming hysterically:<br><br>'Oh dear, an earthquake! Oh, what a dreadful shock! I can't bear<br>it--my heart won't stand it! Oh dear, oh dear! An earthquake!'<br><br>Mr Lackersteen tottered after her, with a strange ataxic step<br>caused partly by earth-tremors and partly by gin.<br><br>'An earthquake, dammit!' he said.<br><br>Flory and Elizabeth slowly picked themselves up. They all went<br>inside, with that queer feeling in the soles of the feet that one<br>has when one steps from a rocking boat on to the shore. The old<br>butler was hurrying from the servants' quarters, thrusting his<br>pagri on his head as he came, and a troop of twittering chokras<br>after him.<br><br>'Earthquake, sir, earthquake!' he bubbled eagerly.<br><br>'I should damn well think it was an earthquake,' said Mr Lackersteen<br>as he lowered himself cautiously into a chair. 'Here, get some<br>drinks, butler. By God, I could do with a nip of something after<br>that.'<br><br>They all had a nip of something. The butler, shy yet beaming,<br>stood on one leg beside the table, with the tray in his hand.<br>'Earthquake, sir, BIG earthquake!' he repeated enthusiastically.<br>He was bursting with eagerness to talk; so, for that matter, was<br>everyone else. An extraordinary joie de vivre had come over them<br>all as soon as the shaky feeling departed from their legs. An<br>earthquake is such fun when it is over. It is so exhilarating to<br>reflect that you are not, as you well might be, lying dead under a<br>heap of ruins. With one accord they all burst out talking: 'My<br>dear, I've never HAD such a shock--I fell absolutely FLAT on my<br>back--I thought it was a dam' pariah dog scratching itself under<br>the floor--I thought it must be an explosion somewhere--' and so on<br>and so forth; the usual earthquake-chatter. Even the butler was<br>included in the conversation.<br><br>'I expect you can remember ever so many earthquakes can't you<br>butler?' said Mrs Lackersteen, quite graciously, for her.<br><br>'Oh yes, madam, many earthquakes! 1887, 1899, 1906, 1912--many,<br>many I can remember, madam!'<br><br>'The 1912 one was a biggish one,' Flory said.<br><br>'Oh, sir, but 1906 was bigger! Very bad shock, sir! And big<br>heathen idol in the temple fall down on top of the thathanabaing,<br>that is Buddhist bishop, madam, which the Burmese say mean bad omen<br>for failure of paddy crop and foot-and-mouth disease. Also in 1887<br>my first earthquake I remember, when I was a little chokra, and<br>Major Maclagan sahib was lying under the table and promising he<br>sign the teetotal pledge tomorrow morning. He not know it was an<br>earthquake. Also two cows was killed by falling roofs,' etc., etc.<br><br>The Europeans stayed in the Club till midnight, and the butler<br>popped into the room as many as half a dozen times, to relate a new<br>anecdote. So far from snubbing him, the Europeans even encouraged<br>him to talk. There is nothing like an earthquake for drawing<br>people together. One more tremor, or perhaps two, and they would<br>have asked the butler to sit down at table with them.<br><br>Meanwhile, Flory's proposal went no further. One cannot propose<br>marriage immediately after an earthquake. In any case, he did not<br>see Elizabeth alone for the rest of that evening. But it did not<br>matter, he knew that she was his now. In the morning there would<br>be time enough. On this thought, at peace in his mind, and dog-<br>tired after the long day, he went to bed.<br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/13.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/15.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
