<h2>Chapter 17</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Flory did not see Elizabeth again until he went down to the Club<br>after dinner. He had not, as he might have done, sought her out<br>and demanded an explanation. His face unnerved him when he looked<br>at it in the glass. With the birthmark on one side and the graze<br>on the other it was so woebegone, so hideous, that he dared not<br>show himself by daylight. As he entered the Club lounge he put his<br>hand over his birthmark--pretext, a mosquito bite on the forehead.<br>It would have been more than his nerve was equal to, not to cover<br>his birthmark at such a moment. However, Elizabeth was not there.<br><br>Instead, he tumbled into an unexpected quarrel. Ellis and<br>Westfield had just got back from the jungle, and they were sitting<br>drinking, in a sour mood. News had come from Rangoon that the<br>editor of the Burmese Patriot had been given only four months'<br>imprisonment for his libel against Mr Macregor, and Ellis was<br>working himself up into a rage over this light sentence. As soon<br>as Flory came in Ellis began baiting him with remarks about 'that<br>little nigger Very-slimy'. At the moment the very thought of<br>quarrelling made Flory yawn, but he answered incautiously, and<br>there was an argument. It grew heated, and after Ellis had called<br>Flory a nigger's Nancy Boy and Flory had replied in kind, Westfield<br>too lost his temper. He was a good-natured man, but Flory's<br>Bolshie ideas sometimes annoyed him. He could never understand<br>why, when there was so clearly a right and a wrong opinion about<br>everything, Flory always seemed to delight in choosing the wrong<br>one. He told Flory 'not to start talking like a damned Hyde Park<br>agitator', and then read him a snappish little sermon, taking as<br>his text the five chief beatitudes of the pukka sahib, namely:<br><br><br>Keeping up our prestige,<br>The firm hand (without the velvet glove),<br>We white men must hang together,<br>Give them an inch and they'll take an ell, and<br>Esprit de Corps.<br><br><br>All the while his anxiety to see Elizabeth was so gnawing at<br>Flory's heart that he could hardly hear what was said to him.<br>Besides, he had heard it all so often, so very often--a hundred<br>times, a thousand times it might be, since his first week in<br>Rangoon, when his burra sahib (an old Scotch gin-soaker and great<br>breeder of racing ponies, afterwards warned off the turf for some<br>dirty business of running the same horse under two different names)<br>saw him take off his topi to pass a native funeral and said to him<br>reprovingly: 'Remember laddie, always remember, we are sahiblog<br>and they are dirrt!' It sickened him, now, to have to listen to<br>such trash. So he cut Westfield short by saying blasphemously:<br><br>'Oh, shut up! I'm sick of the subject. Veraswami's a damned good<br>fellow--a damned sight better than some white men I can think of.<br>Anyway, I'm going to propose his name for the Club when the general<br>meeting comes. Perhaps he'll liven this bloody place up a bit.'<br><br>Whereat the row would have become serious if it had not ended as<br>most rows ended at the Club--with the appearance of the butler, who<br>had heard the raised voices.<br><br>'Did master call, sir?'<br><br>'No. Go to hell,' said Ellis morosely.<br><br>The butler retired, but that was the end of the dispute for the<br>time being. At this moment there were footsteps and voices<br>outside; the Lackersteens were arriving at the Club.<br><br>When they entered the lounge, Flory could not even nerve himself to<br>look directly at Elizabeth; but he noticed that all three of them<br>were much more smartly dressed than usual. Mr Lackersteen was even<br>wearing a dinner-jacket--white, because of the season--and was<br>completely sober. The boiled shirt and pique waistcoat seemed to<br>hold him upright and stiffen his moral fibre like a breastplate.<br>Mrs Lackersteen looked handsome and serpentine in a red dress. In<br>some indefinable way all three gave the impression that they were<br>waiting to receive some distinguished guest.<br><br>When drinks had been called for, and Mrs Lackersteen had usurped<br>the place under the punkah, Flory took a chair on the outside of<br>the group. He dared not accost Elizabeth yet. Mrs Lackersteen had<br>begun talking in an extraordinary, silly manner about the dear<br>Prince of Wales, and putting on an accent like a temporarily<br>promoted chorus-girl playing the part of a duchess in a musical<br>comedy. The others wondered privately what the devil was the<br>matter with her. Flory had stationed himself almost behind<br>Elizabeth. She was wearing a yellow frock, cut very short as the<br>fashion then was, with champagne-coloured stockings and slippers to<br>match, and she carried a big ostrich-feather fan. She looked so<br>modish, so adult, that he feared her more than he had ever done.<br>It was unbelievable that he had ever kissed her. She was talking<br>easily to all the others at once, and now and again he dared to put<br>a word into the general conversation; but she never answered him<br>directly, and whether or not she meant to ignore him, he could not<br>tell.<br><br>'Well,' said Mrs Lackersteen presently, 'and who's for a rubbah?'<br><br>She said quite distinctly a 'rubbah'. Her accent was growing more<br>aristocratic with every word she uttered. It was unaccountable.<br>It appeared that Ellis, Westfield and Mr Lackersteen were for a<br>'rubbah'. Flory refused as soon as he saw that Elizabeth was not<br>playing. Now or never was his chance to get her alone. When they<br>all moved for the card-room, he saw with a mixture of fear and<br>relief that Elizabeth came last. He stopped in the doorway,<br>barring her path. He had turned dreadly pale. She shrank from him<br>a little.<br><br>'Excuse me,' they both said simultaneously.<br><br>'One moment,' he said, and do what he would his voice trembled.<br>'May I speak to you? You don't mind--there's something I must<br>say.'<br><br>'Will you please let me pass, Mr Flory?'<br><br>'Please! Please! We're alone now. You won't refuse just to let<br>me speak?'<br><br>'What is it, then?'<br><br>'It's only this. Whatever I've done to offend you--please tell me<br>what it is. Tell me and let me put it right. I'd sooner cut my<br>hand off than offend you. Just tell me, don't let me go on not<br>even knowing what it is.'<br><br>'I really don't know what you're talking about. "Tell you how<br>you've offended me?" Why should you have OFFENDED me?'<br><br>'But I must have! After the way you behaved!'<br><br>'"After the way I behaved?" I don't know what you mean. I don't<br>know why you're talking in this extraordinary way at all.'<br><br>'But you won't even speak to me! This morning you cut me<br>absolutely dead.'<br><br>'Surely I can do as I like without being questioned?'<br><br>'But please, please! Don't you see, you must see, what it's like<br>for me to be snubbed all of a sudden. After all, only last night<br>you--'<br><br>She turned pink. 'I think it's absolutely--absolutely caddish of<br>you to mention such things!'<br><br>'I know, I know. I know all that. But what else can I do? You<br>walked past me this morning as though I'd been a stone. I know<br>that I've offended you in some way. Can you blame me if I want to<br>know what it is that I've done?'<br><br>He was, as usual, making it worse with every word he said. He<br>perceived that whatever he had done, to be made to speak of it<br>seemed to her worse than the thing itself. She was not going to<br>explain. She was going to leave him in the dark--snub him and then<br>pretend that nothing had happened; the natural feminine move.<br>Nevertheless he urged her again:<br><br>'Please tell me. I can't let everything end between us like this.'<br><br>'"End between us"? There was nothing to end,' she said coldly.<br><br>The vulgarity of this remark wounded him, and he said quickly:<br><br>'That wasn't like you, Elizabeth! It's not generous to cut a man<br>dead after you've been kind to him, and then refuse even to tell<br>him the reason. You might be straightforward with me. Please tell<br>me what it is that I've done.'<br><br>She gave him an oblique, bitter look, bitter not because of what he<br>had done, but because he had made her speak of it. But perhaps she<br>was anxious to end the scene, and she said:<br><br>'Well then, if you absolutely force me to speak of it--'<br><br>'Yes?'<br><br>'I'm told that at the very same time as you were pretending to--<br>well, when you were . . . with me--oh, it's too beastly! I can't<br>speak of it.'<br><br>'Go on.'<br><br>'I'm told that you're keeping a Burmese woman. And now, will you<br>please let me pass?'<br><br>With that she sailed--there was no other possible word for it--she<br>sailed past him with a swish of her short skirts, and vanished into<br>the card-room. And he remained looking after her, too appalled to<br>speak, and looking unutterably ridiculous.<br><br>It was dreadful. He could not face her after that. He turned to<br>hurry out of the Club, and then dared not even pass the door of the<br>card-room, lest she should see him. He went into the lounge,<br>wondering how to escape, and finally climbed over the veranda rail<br>and dropped on to the small square of lawn that ran down to the<br>Irrawaddy. The sweat was running from his forehead. He could have<br>shouted with anger and distress. The accursed luck of it! To be<br>caught out over a thing like that. 'Keeping a Burmese woman'--and<br>it was not even true! But much use it would ever be to deny it.<br>Ah, what damned, evil chance could have brought it to her ears?<br><br>But as a matter of fact, it was no chance. It had a perfectly<br>sound cause, which was also the cause of Mrs Lackersteen's curious<br>behaviour at the Club this evening. On the previous night, just<br>before the earthquake, Mrs Lackersteen had been reading the Civil<br>List. The Civil List (which tells you the exact income of every<br>official in Burma) was a source of inexhaustible interest to her.<br>She was in the middle of adding up the pay and allowances of a<br>Conservator of Forests whom she had once met in Mandalay, when it<br>occurred to her to look up the name of Lieutenant Verrall, who, she<br>had heard from Mr Macregor, was arriving at Kyauktada tomorrow with<br>a hundred Military Policemen. When she found the name, she saw in<br>front of it two words that startled her almost out of her wits.<br><br>The words were 'The Honourable'!<br><br>The HONOURABLE! Lieutenants the Honourable are rare anywhere, rare<br>as diamonds in the Indian Army, rare as dodos in Burma. And when<br>you are the aunt of the only marriageable young woman within fifty<br>miles, and you hear that a lieutenant the Honourable is arriving no<br>later than tomorrow--well! With dismay Mrs Lackersteen remembered<br>that Elizabeth was out in the garden with Flory--that drunken<br>wretch Flory, whose pay was barely seven hundred rupees a month,<br>and who, it was only too probable, was already proposing to her!<br>She hastened immediately to call Elizabeth inside, but at this<br>moment the earthquake intervened. However, on the way home there<br>was an opportunity to speak. Mrs Lackersteen laid her hand<br>affectionately on Elizabeth's arm and said in the tenderest voice<br>she had ever succeeded in producing:<br><br>'Of course you know, Elizabeth dear, that Flory is keeping a<br>Burmese woman?'<br><br>For a moment this deadly charge actually failed to explode.<br>Elizabeth was so new to the ways of the country that the remark<br>made no impression on her. It sounded hardly more significant than<br>'keeping a parrot'.<br><br>'Keeping a Burmese woman? What for?'<br><br>'What FOR? My dear! what DOES a man keep a woman for?'<br><br>And, of course, that was that.<br><br>For a long time Flory remained standing by the river bank. The<br>moon was up, mirrored in the water like a broad shield of electron.<br>The coolness of the outer air had changed Flory's mood. He had not<br>even the heart to be angry any longer. For he had perceived, with<br>the deadly self-knowledge and self-loathing that come to one at<br>such a time, that what had happened served him perfectly right.<br>For a moment it seemed to him that an endless procession of Burmese<br>women, a regiment of ghosts, were marching past him in the<br>moonlight. Heavens, what numbers of them! A thousand--no, but a<br>full hundred at the least. 'Eyes right!' he thought despondently.<br>Their heads turned towards him, but they had no faces, only<br>featureless discs. He remembered a blue longyi here, a pair of<br>ruby ear-rings there, but hardly a face or a name. The gods are<br>just and of our pleasant vices (pleasant, indeed!) make instruments<br>to plague us. He had dirtied himself beyond redemption, and this<br>was his just punishment.<br><br>He made his way slowly through the croton bushes and round the<br>clubhouse. He was too saddened to feel the full pain of the<br>disaster yet. It would begin hurting, as all deep wounds do, long<br>afterwards. As he passed through the gate something stirred the<br>leaves behind him. He started. There was a whisper of harsh<br>Burmese syllables.<br><br>'Pike-san pay-like! Pike-san pay-like!'<br><br>He turned sharply. The 'pike-san pay-like' ('Give me the money')<br>was repeated. He saw a woman standing under the shadow of the gold<br>mohur tree. It was Ma Hla May. She stepped out into the moonlight<br>warily, with a hostile air, keeping her distance as though afraid<br>that he would strike her. Her face was coated with powder, sickly<br>white in the moon, and it looked as ugly as a skull, and defiant.<br><br>She had given him a shock. 'What the devil are you doing here?' he<br>said angrily in English.<br><br>'Pike-san pay-like!'<br><br>'What money? What do you mean? Why are you following me about<br>like this?'<br><br>'Pike-san pay-like!' she repeated almost in a scream. 'The money<br>you promised me, thakin. You said you would give me more money. I<br>want it now, this instant!'<br><br>'How can I give it you now? You shall have it next month. I have<br>given you a hundred and fifty rupees already.'<br><br>To his alarm she began shrieking 'Pike-san pay-like!' and a number<br>of similar phrases almost at the top of her voice. She seemed on<br>the verge of hysterics. The volume of noise that she produced was<br>startling.<br><br>'Be quiet! They'll hear you in the Club!' he exclaimed, and was<br>instantly sorry for putting the idea into her head.<br><br>'Aha! NOW I know what will frighten you! Give me the money this<br>instant, or I will scream for help and bring them all out here.<br>Quick, now, or I begin screaming!'<br><br>'You bitch!' he said, and took a step towards her. She sprang<br>nimbly out of reach, whipped off her slipper, and stood defying<br>him.<br><br>'Be quick! Fifty rupees now and the rest tomorrow. Out with it!<br>Or I give a scream they can hear as far as the bazaar!'<br><br>Flory swore. This was not the time for such a scene. Finally he<br>took out his pocket-book, found twenty-five rupees in it, and threw<br>them on to the ground. Ma Hla May pounced on the notes and counted<br>them.<br><br>'I said fifty rupees, thakin!'<br><br>'How can I give it you if I haven't got it? Do you think I carry<br>hundreds of rupees about with me?'<br><br>'I said fifty rupees!'<br><br>'Oh, get out of my way!' he said in English, and pushed past her.<br><br>But the wretched woman would not leave him alone. She began to<br>follow him up the road like a disobedient dog, screaming out 'Pike-<br>san pay-like! Pike-san pay-like!' as though mere noise could bring<br>the money into existence. He hurried, partly to draw her away from<br>the Club, partly in hopes of shaking her off, but she seemed ready<br>to follow him as far as the house if necessary. After a while he<br>could not stand it any longer, and he turned to drive her back.<br><br>'Go away this instant! If you follow me any farther you shall<br>never have another anna.'<br><br>'Pike-san pay-like!'<br><br>'You fool,' he said, 'what good is this doing? How can I give you<br>the money when I have not another pice on me?'<br><br>'That is a likely story!'<br><br>He felt helplessly in his pockets. He was so wearied that he would<br>have given her anything to be rid of her. His fingers encountered<br>his cigarette-case, which was of gold. He took it out.<br><br>'Here, if I give you this will you go away? You can pawn it for<br>thirty rupees.'<br><br>Ma Hla May seemed to consider, then said sulkily, 'Give it me.'<br><br>He threw the cigarette-case on to the grass beside the road. She<br>grabbed it and immediately sprang back clutching it to her ingyi,<br>as though afraid that he would take it away again. He turned and<br>made for the house, thanking God to be out of the sound of her<br>voice. The cigarette-case was the same one that she had stolen ten<br>days ago.<br><br>At the gate he looked back. Ma Hla May was still standing at the<br>bottom of the hill, a greyish figurine in the moonlight. She must<br>have watched him up the hill like a dog watching a suspicious<br>stranger out of sight. It was queer. The thought crossed his mind,<br>as it had a few days earlier when she sent him the blackmailing<br>letter, that her behaviour had been curious and unlike herself. She<br>was showing a tenacity of which he would never have thought her<br>capable--almost, indeed, as though someone else were egging her on. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/15.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/17.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
