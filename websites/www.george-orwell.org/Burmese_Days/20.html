<h2>Chapter 21</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">O western wind, when wilt thou blow, that the small rain down can<br>rain? It was the first of June, the day of the general meeting,<br>and there had not been a drop of rain yet. As Flory came up the<br>Club path the sun of afternoon, slanting beneath his hat-brim, was<br>still savage enough to scorch his neck uncomfortably. The mali<br>staggered along the path, his breast-muscles slippery with sweat,<br>carrying two kerosene-tins of water on a yoke. He dumped them<br>down, slopping a little water over his lank brown feet, and<br>salaamed to Flory.<br><br>'Well, mali, is the rain coming?'<br><br>The man gestured vaguely towards the west. 'The hills have<br>captured it, sahib.'<br><br>Kyauktada was ringed almost round by hills, and these caught the<br>earlier showers, so that sometimes no rain fell till almost the end<br>of June. The earth of the flower-beds, hoed into large untidy<br>lumps, looked grey and hard as concrete. Flory went into the<br>lounge and found Westfield loafing by the veranda, looking out over<br>the river, for the chicks had been rolled up. At the foot of the<br>veranda a chokra lay on his back in the sun, pulling the punkah<br>rope with his heel and shading his face with a broad strip of<br>banana leaf.<br><br>'Hullo, Flory! You've got thin as a rake.'<br><br>'So've you.'<br><br>'H'm, yes. Bloody weather. No appetite except for booze. Christ,<br>won't I be glad when I hear the frogs start croaking. Let's have a<br>spot before the others come. Butler!'<br><br>'Do you know who's coming to the meeting?' Flory said, when the<br>butler had brought whisky and tepid soda.<br><br>'Whole crowd, I believe. Lackersteen got back from camp three days<br>ago. By God, that man's been having the time of his life away from<br>his missus! My inspector was telling me about the goings-on at his<br>camp. Tarts by the score. Must have imported 'em specially from<br>Kyauktada. He'll catch it all right when the old woman sees his<br>Club bill. Eleven bottles of whisky sent out to his camp in a<br>fortnight.'<br><br>'Is young Verrall coming?'<br><br>'No, he's only a temporary member. Not that he'd trouble to come<br>anyway, young tick. Maxwell won't be here either. Can't leave<br>camp just yet, he says. He sent word Ellis was to speak for him if<br>there's any voting to be done. Don't suppose there'll be anything<br>to vote about, though eh?' he added, looking at Flory obliquely,<br>for both of them remembered their previous quarrel on this subject.<br><br>'I suppose it lies with Macgregor.'<br><br>'What I mean is, Macgregor'll have dropped that bloody rot about<br>electing a native member, eh? Not the moment for it just now.<br>After the rebellion and all that.'<br><br>'What about the rebellion, by the way?' said Flory. He did not<br>want to start wrangling about the doctor's election yet. There was<br>going to be trouble and to spare in a few minutes. 'Any more news--<br>are they going to have another try, do you think?'<br><br>'No. All over, I'm afraid. They caved in like the funks they are.<br>The whole district's as quiet as a bloody girls' school. Most<br>disappointing.'<br><br>Flory's heart missed a beat. He had heard Elizabeth's voice in the<br>next room. Mr Macgregor came in at this moment, Ellis and Mr<br>Lackersteen following. This made up the full quota, for the women<br>members of the Club had no votes. Mr Macgregor was already dressed<br>in a silk suit, and was carrying the Club account books under his<br>arm. He managed to bring a sub-official air even into such petty<br>business as a Club meeting.<br><br>'As we seem to be all here,' he said after the usual greetings,<br>'shall we--ah--proceed with our labours?'<br><br>'Lead on, Macduff,' said Westfield, sitting down.<br><br>'Call the butler, someone, for Christ's sake,' said Mr Lackersteen.<br>'I daren't let my missus hear me calling him.'<br><br>'Before we apply ourselves to the agenda,' said Mr Macgregor when<br>he had refused a drink and the others had taken one, 'I expect you<br>will want me to run through the accounts for the half-year?'<br><br>They did not want it particularly, but Mr Macgregor, who enjoyed<br>this kind of thing, ran through the accounts with great thoroughness.<br>Flory's thoughts were wandering. There was going to be such a row<br>in a moment--oh, such a devil of a row! They would be furious when<br>they found that he was proposing the doctor after all. And<br>Elizabeth was in the next room. God send she didn't hear the noise<br>of the row when it came. It would make her despise him all the more<br>to see the others baiting him. Would he see her this evening?<br>Would she speak to him? He gazed across the quarter-mile of<br>gleaming river. By the far bank a knot of men, one of them wearing<br>a green gaungbaung, were waiting beside a sampan. In the channel,<br>by the nearer bank, a huge, clumsy Indian barge struggled with<br>desperate slowness against the racing current. At each stroke the<br>ten rowers, Dravidian starvelings, ran forward and plunged their<br>long primitive oars, with heart-shaped blades, into the water. They<br>braced their meagre bodies, then tugged, writhed, strained backwards<br>like agonized creatures of black rubber, and the ponderous hull<br>crept onwards a yard or two. Then the rowers sprang forward,<br>panting, to plunge their oars again before the current should check<br>her.<br><br>'And now,' said Mr Macgregor more gravely, 'we come to the main<br>point of the agenda. That, of course, is this--ah--distasteful<br>question, which I am afraid must be faced, of electing a native<br>member to this Club. When we discussed the matter before--'<br><br>'What the hell!'<br><br>It was Ellis who had interrupted. He was so excited that he had<br>sprung to his feet.<br><br>'What the hell! Surely we aren't starting THAT over again? Talk<br>about electing a damned nigger so this Club, after everything<br>that's happened! Good God, I thought even Flory had dropped it by<br>this time!'<br><br>'Our friend Ellis appears surprised. The matter has been discussed<br>before, I believe.'<br><br>'I should think it damned well was discussed before! And we all<br>said what we thought of it. By God--'<br><br>'If our friend Ellis will sit down for a few moments--' said Mr<br>Macgregor tolerantly.<br><br>Ellis threw himself into his chair again, exclaiming, 'Bloody<br>rubbish!' Beyond the river Flory could see the group of Burmans<br>embarking. They were lifting a long, awkward-shaped bundle into<br>the sampan. Mr Macregor had produced a letter from his file of<br>papers.<br><br>'Perhaps I had better explain how this question arose in the first<br>place. The Commissioner tells me that a circular has been sent<br>round by the Government, suggesting that in those Clubs where there<br>are no native members, one at least shall be co-opted; that is,<br>admitted automatically. The circular says--ah yes! here it is:<br>"It is mistaken policy to offer social affronts to native officials<br>of high standing." I may say that I disagree most emphatically.<br>No doubt we all do. We who have to do the actual work of<br>government see things very differently from these--ah--Paget M.P.s<br>who interfere with us from above. The Commissioner quite agrees<br>with me. However--'<br><br>'But it's all bloody rot!' broke in Ellis. 'What's it got to do<br>with the Commissioner or anyone else? Surely we can do as we like<br>in our own bloody Club? They've no right to dictate to us when<br>we're off duty.'<br><br>'Quite,' said Westfield.<br><br>'You anticipate me. I told the Commissioner that I should have to<br>put the matter before the other members. And the course he<br>suggests is this. If the idea finds any support in the Club, he<br>thinks it would be better if we co-opted our native member. On the<br>other hand, if the entire Club is against it, it can be dropped.<br>That is, if opinion is quite unanimous.'<br><br>'Well, it damned well is unanimous,' said Ellis.<br><br>'D'you mean,' said Westfield, 'that it depends on ourselves whether<br>we have 'em in here or no?'<br><br>'I fancy we can take it as meaning that.'<br><br>'Well, then, let's say we're against it to a man.'<br><br>'And say it bloody firmly, by God. We want to put our foot down on<br>this idea once and for all.'<br><br>'Hear, hear!' said Mr Lackersteen gruffly. 'Keep the black swabs<br>out of it. Esprit de corps and all that.'<br><br>Mr Lackersteen could always be relied upon for sound sentiments in<br>a case like this. In his heart he did not care and never had cared<br>a damn for the British Raj, and he was as happy drinking with an<br>Oriental as with a white man; but he was always ready with a loud<br>'Hear, hear!' when anyone suggested the bamboo for disrespectful<br>servants or boiling oil for Nationalists. He prided himself that<br>though he might booze a bit and all that, dammit, he WAS loyal. It<br>was his form of respectability. Mr Macgregor was secretly rather<br>relieved by the general agreement. If any Oriental member were co-<br>opted, that member would have to be Dr Veraswami, and he had had<br>the deepest distrust of the doctor ever since Nga Shwe O's<br>suspicious escape from the jail.<br><br>'Then I take it that you are all agreed?' he said. 'If so, I will<br>inform the Commissioner. Otherwise, we must begin discussing the<br>candidate for election.'<br><br>Flory stood up. He had got to say his say. His heart seemed to<br>have risen into his throat and to be choking him. From what Mr<br>Macgregor had said, it was clear that it was in his power to secure<br>the doctor's election by speaking the word. But oh, what a bore,<br>what a nuisance it was! What an infernal uproar there would be!<br>How he wished he had never given the doctor that promise! No<br>matter, he had given it, and he could not break it. So short a<br>time ago he would have broken it, en bon pukka sahib, how easily!<br>But not now. He had got to see this thing through. He turned<br>himself sidelong so that his birthmark was away from the others.<br>Already he could feel his voice going flat and guilty.<br><br>'Our friend Flory has something to suggest?'<br><br>'Yes. I propose Dr Veraswami as a member of this Club.'<br><br>There was such a yell of dismay from three of the others that Mr<br>Macgregor had to rap sharply on the table and remind them that the<br>ladies were in the next room. Ellis took not the smallest notice.<br>He had sprung to his feet again, and the skin round his nose had<br>gone quite grey. He and Flory remained facing one another, as<br>though on the point of blows.<br><br>'Now, you damned swab, will you take that back?'<br><br>'No, I will not.'<br><br>'You oily swine! You nigger's Nancy Boy! You crawling, sneaking,--<br>bloody bastard!'<br><br>'Order!' exclaimed Mr Macgregor.<br><br>'But look at him, look at him!' cried Ellis almost tearfully.<br>'Letting us all down for the sake of a pot-bellied nigger! After<br>all we've said to him! When we've only got to hang together and we<br>can keep the stink of garlic out of this Club for ever. My God,<br>wouldn't it make you spew your guts up to see anyone behaving like<br>such a--?'<br><br>'Take it back, Flory, old man!' said Westfield. 'Don't be a bloody<br>fool!'<br><br>'Downright Bolshevism, dammit!' said Mr Lackersteen.<br><br>'Do you think I care what you say? What business is it of yours?<br>It's for Macgregor to decide.'<br><br>'Then do you--ah--adhere to your decision?' said Mr Macgregor<br>gloomily.<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>Mr Macgregor sighed. 'A pity! Well, in that case I suppose I have<br>no choice--'<br><br>'No, no, no!' cried Ellis, dancing about in his rage. 'Don't give<br>in to him! Put it to the vote. And if that son of a bitch doesn't<br>put in a black ball like the rest of us, we'll first turf him out<br>of the Club himself, and then--well! Butler!'<br><br>'Sahib!' said the butler, appearing.<br><br>'Bring the ballot box and the balls. Now clear out!' he added<br>roughly when the butler had obeyed.<br><br>The air had gone very stagnant; for some reason the punkah had<br>stopped working. Mr Macgregor stood up with a disapproving but<br>judicial mien, taking the two drawers of black and white balls out<br>of the ballot box.<br><br>'We must proceed in order. Mr Flory proposes Dr Veraswami, the<br>Civil Surgeon, as a member of this Club. Mistaken, in my opinion,<br>greatly mistaken; however--! Before putting the matter to the<br>vote--'<br><br>'Oh, why make a song and dance about it?' said Ellis. 'Here's my<br>contribution! And another for Maxwell.' He plumped two black<br>balls into the box. Then one of his sudden spasms of rage seized<br>him, and he took the drawer of white balls and pitched them across<br>the floor. They went flying in all directions. 'There! Now pick<br>one up if you want to use it!'<br><br>'You damned fool! What good do you think that does?'<br><br>'Sahib!'<br><br>They all started and looked round. The chokra was goggling at them<br>over the veranda rail, having climbed up from below. With one<br>skinny arm he clung to the rail and with the other gesticulated<br>towards the river.<br><br>'Sahib! Sahib!'<br><br>'What's up?' said Westfield.<br><br>They all moved for the window. The sampan that Flory had seen<br>across the river was lying under the bank at the foot of the lawn,<br>one of the men clinging to a bush to steady it. The Burman in the<br>green gaungbaung was climbing out.<br><br>'That's one of Maxwell's Forest Rangers!' said Ellis in quite a<br>different voice. 'By God! something's happened!'<br><br>The Forest Ranger saw Mr Macgregor, shikoed in a hurried,<br>preoccupied way and turned back to the sampan. Four other men,<br>peasants, climbed out after him, and with difficulty lifted ashore<br>the strange bundle that Flory had seen in the distance. It was six<br>feet long, swathed in cloths, like a mummy. Something happened in<br>everybody's entrails. The Forest Ranger glanced at the veranda,<br>saw that there was no way up, and led the peasants round the path<br>to the front of the Club. They had hoisted the bundle on to their<br>shoulders as funeral bearers hoist a coffin. The butler had<br>flitted into the lounge again, and even his face was pale after its<br>fashion--that is, grey.<br><br>'Butler!' said Mr Macgregor sharply.<br><br>'Sir!'<br><br>'Go quickly and shut the door of the card-room.
