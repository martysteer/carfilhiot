<h2>Chapter 18</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">After the row overnight Ellis was looking forward to a week of<br>baiting Flory. He had nicknamed him Nancy--short for nigger's<br>Nancy Boy, but the women did not know that--and was already<br>inventing wild scandals about him. Ellis always invented scandals<br>about anyone with whom he had quarrelled--scandals which grew, by<br>repeated embroideries, into a species of saga. Flory's incautious<br>remark that Dr Veraswami was a 'damned good fellow' had swelled<br>before long into a whole Daily Worker-ful of blasphemy and<br>sedition.<br><br>'On my honour, Mrs Lackersteen,' said Ellis--Mrs Lackersteen had<br>taken a sudden dislike to Flory after discovering the great secret<br>about Verrall, and she was quite ready to listen to Ellis's tales--<br>'on my honour, if you'd been there last night and heard the things<br>that man Flory was saying--well, it'd have made you shiver in your<br>shoes!'<br><br>'Really! You know, I always thought he had such CURIOUS ideas.<br>What has he been talking about now? Not SOCIALISM, I hope?'<br><br>'Worse.'<br><br>There were long recitals. However, to Ellis's disappointment,<br>Flory had not stayed in Kyauktada to be baited. He had gone back<br>to camp the day after his dismissal by Elizabeth. Elizabeth heard<br>most of the scandalous tales about him. She understood his<br>character perfectly now. She understood why it was that he had so<br>often bored her and irritated her. He was a highbrow--her<br>deadliest word--a highbrow, to be classed with Lenin, A. J. Cook<br>and the dirty little poets in the Montparnasse cafes. She could<br>have forgiven him even his Burmese mistress more easily than that.<br>Flory wrote to her three days later; a weak, stilted letter, which<br>he sent by hand--his camp was a day's march from Kyauktada.<br>Elizabeth did not answer.<br><br>It was lucky for Flory that at present he was too busy to have time<br>to think. The whole camp was at sixes and sevens since his long<br>absence. Nearly thirty coolies were missing, the sick elephant was<br>worse than ever, and a vast pile of teak logs which should have<br>been sent off ten days earlier were still waiting because the<br>engine would not work. Flory, a fool about machinery, struggled<br>with the bowels of the engine until he was black with grease and Ko<br>S'la told him sharply that white men ought not to do 'coolie-work'.<br>The engine was finally persuaded to run, or at least to totter.<br>The sick elephant was discovered to be suffering from tapeworms.<br>As for the coolies, they had deserted because their supply of opium<br>had been cut off--they would not stay in the jungle without opium,<br>which they took as a prophylactic against fever. U Po Kyin,<br>willing to do Flory a bad turn, had caused the Excise Officers to<br>make a raid and seize the opium. Flory wrote to Dr Veraswami,<br>asking for his help. The doctor sent back a quantity of opium,<br>illegally procured, medicine for the elephant and a careful letter<br>of instructions. A tapeworm measuring twenty-one feet was<br>extracted. Flory was busy twelve hours a day. In the evening if<br>there was no more to do he would plunge into the jungle and walk<br>and walk until the sweat stung his eyes and his knees were bleeding<br>from the briers. The nights were his bad time. The bitterness of<br>what had happened was sinking into him, as it usually does, by slow<br>degrees.<br><br>Meanwhile, several days had passed and Elizabeth had not yet seen<br>Verrall at less than a hundred yards' distance. It had been a<br>great disappointment when he had not appeared at the Club on the<br>evening of his arrival. Mr Lackersteen was really quite angry when<br>he discovered that he had been hounded into his dinner-jacket for<br>nothing. Next morning Mrs Lackersteen made her husband send an<br>officious note to the dakbungalow, inviting Verrall to the Club;<br>there was no answer, however. More days passed, and Verrall made<br>no move to join in the local society. He had even neglected his<br>official calls, not even bothering to present himself at Mr<br>Macgregor's office. The dakbungalow was at the other end of the<br>town, near the station, and he had made himself quite comfortable<br>there. There is a rule that one must vacate a dakbungalow after a<br>stated number of days, but Verrall peaceably ignored it. The<br>Europeans only saw him at morning and evening on the maidan. On<br>the second day after his arrival fifty of his men turned out with<br>sickles and cleared a large patch of the maidan, after which<br>Verrall was to be seen galloping to and fro, practising polo<br>strokes. He took not the smallest notice of any Europeans who<br>passed down the road. Westfield and Ellis were furious, and even<br>Mr Macgregor said that Verrall's behaviour was 'ungracious'. They<br>would all have fallen at the feet of a lieutenant the Honourable if<br>he had shown the smallest courtesy; as it was, everyone except the<br>two women detested him from the start. It is always so with titled<br>people, they are either adored or hated. If they accept one it is<br>charming simplicity, if they ignore one it is loathsome<br>snobbishness; there are no half-measures.<br><br>Verrall was the youngest son of a peer, and not at all rich, but by<br>the method of seldom paying a bill until a writ was issued against<br>him, he managed to keep himself in the only things he seriously<br>cared about: clothes and horses. He had come out to India in a<br>British cavalry regiment, and exchanged into the Indian Army<br>because it was cheaper and left him greater freedom for polo.<br>After two years his debts were so enormous that he entered the<br>Burma Military Police, in which it was notoriously possible to save<br>money; however, he detested Burma--it is no country for a horseman--<br>and he had already applied to go back to his regiment. He was the<br>kind of soldier who can get exchanges when he wants them. Meanwhile,<br>he was only to be in Kyauktada for a month, and he had no intention<br>of mixing himself up with all the petty sahiblog of the district.<br>He knew the society of those small Burma stations--a nasty,<br>poodle-faking, horseless riffraff. He despised them.<br><br>They were not the only people whom Verrall despised, however. His<br>various contempts would take a long time to catalogue in detail.<br>He despised the entire non-military population of India, a few<br>famous polo players excepted. He despised the entire Army as well,<br>except the cavalry. He despised all Indian regiments, infantry and<br>cavalry alike. It was true that he himself belonged to a native<br>regiment, but that was only for his own convenience. He took no<br>interest in Indians, and his Urdu consisted mainly of swear-words,<br>with all the verbs in the third person singular. His Military<br>Policemen he looked on as no better than coolies. 'Christ, what<br>God-forsaken swine!' he was often heard to mutter as he moved down<br>the ranks inspecting, with the old subahdar carrying his sword<br>behind him. Verrall had even been in trouble once for his<br>outspoken opinions on native troops. It was at a review, and<br>Verrall was among the group of officers standing behind the<br>general. An Indian infantry regiment approached for the march-<br>past.<br><br>'The ---- Rifles,' somebody said.<br><br>'AND look at it,' said Verrall in his surly boy's voice.<br><br>The white-haired colonel of the ---- Rifles was standing near. He<br>flushed to the neck, and reported Verrall to the general. Verrall<br>was reprimanded, but the general, a British Army officer himself,<br>did not rub it in very hard. Somehow, nothing very serious ever<br>did happen to Verrall, however offensive he made himself. Up and<br>down India, wherever he was stationed, he left behind him a trail<br>of insulted people, neglected duties and unpaid bills. Yet the<br>disgraces that ought to have fallen on him never did. He bore a<br>charmed life, and it was not only the handle to his name that saved<br>him. There was something in his eye before which duns, burra<br>memsahibs and even colonels quailed.<br><br>It was a disconcerting eye, pale blue and a little protuberant, but<br>exceedingly clear. It looked you over, weighed you in the balance<br>and found you wanting, in a single cold scrutiny of perhaps five<br>seconds. If you were the right kind of man--that is, if you were a<br>cavalry officer and a polo player--Verrall took you for granted and<br>even treated you with a surly respect; if you were any other type<br>of man whatever, he despised you so utterly that he could not have<br>hidden it even if he would. It did not even make any difference<br>whether you were rich or poor, for in the social sense he was not<br>more than normally a snob. Of course, like all sons of rich<br>families, he thought poverty disgusting and that poor people are<br>poor because they prefer disgusting habits. But he despised soft<br>living. Spending, or rather owing, fabulous sums on clothes, he<br>yet lived almost as ascetically as a monk. He exercised himself<br>ceaselessly and brutally, rationed his drink and his cigarettes,<br>slept on a camp bed (in silk pyjamas) and bathed in cold water in<br>the bitterest winter. Horsemanship and physical fitness were the<br>only gods he knew. The stamp of hoofs on the maidan, the strong,<br>poised feeling of his body, wedded centaurlike to the saddle, the<br>polo-stick springy in his hand--these were his religion, the breath<br>of his life. The Europeans in Burma--boozing, womanizing, yellow-<br>faced loafers--made him physically sick when he thought of their<br>habits. As for social duties of all descriptions, he called them<br>poodle-faking and ignored them. Women he abhorred. In his view<br>they were a kind of siren whose one aim was to lure men away from<br>polo and enmesh them in tea-fights and tennis-parties. He was not,<br>however, quite proof against women. He was young, and women of<br>nearly all kinds threw themselves at his head; now and again he<br>succumbed. But his lapses soon disgusted him, and he was too<br>callous when the pinch came to have any difficulty about escaping.<br>He had had perhaps a dozen such escapes during his two years in<br>India.<br><br>A whole week went by. Elizabeth had not even succeeded in making<br>Verrall's acquaintance. It was so tantalizing! Every day, morning<br>and evening, she and her aunt walked down to the Club and back<br>again, past the maidan; and there was Verrall, hitting the polo-<br>balls the sepoys threw for him, ignoring the two women utterly.<br>So near and yet so far! What made it even worse was that neither<br>woman would have considered it decent to speak of the matter<br>directly. One evening the polo-ball, struck too hard, came<br>swishing through the grass and rolled across the road in front of<br>them. Elizabeth and her aunt stopped involuntarily. But it was<br>only a sepoy who ran to fetch the ball. Verrall had seen the women<br>and kept his distance.<br><br>Next morning Mrs Lackersteen paused as they came out of the gate.<br>She had given up riding in her rickshaw lately. At the bottom of<br>the maidan the Military Policemen were drawn up, a dust-coloured<br>rank with bayonets glittering. Verrall was facing them, but not in<br>uniform--he seldom put on his uniform for morning parade, not<br>thinking it necessary with mere Military Policemen. The two women<br>were looking at everything except Verrall, and at the same time, in<br>some manner, were contriving to look at him.<br><br>'The wretched thing is,' said Mrs Lackersteen--this was a propos de<br>bottes, but the subject needed no introduction--'the wretched thing<br>is that I'm afraid your uncle simply MUST go back to camp before<br>long.'<br><br>'Must he really?'<br><br>'I'm afraid so. It is so HATEFUL in camp at this time of year!<br>Oh, those mosquitoes!'<br><br>'Couldn't he stay a bit longer? A week, perhaps?'<br><br>'I don't see how he can. He's been nearly a month in headquarters<br>now. The firm would be furious if they heard of it. And of course<br>both of us will have to go with him. SUCH a bore! The mosquitoes--<br>simply terrible!'<br><br>Terrible indeed! To have to go away before Elizabeth had so much<br>as said how-do-you-do to Verrall! But they would certainly have to<br>go if Mr Lackersteen went. It would never do to leave him to<br>himself. Satan finds some mischief still, even in the jungle. A<br>ripple like fire ran down the line of sepoys; they were unfixing<br>bayonets before marching away. The dusty rank turned left,<br>saluted, and marched off in columns of fours. The orderlies were<br>coming from the police lines with the ponies and polo-sticks. Mrs<br>Lackersteen took a heroic decision.<br><br>'I think,' she said, 'we'll take a short-cut across the maidan.<br>It's SO much quicker than going right round by the road.'<br><br>It WAS quicker by about fifty yards, but no one ever went that way<br>on foot, because of the grass-seeds that got into one's stockings.<br>Mrs Lackersteen plunged boldly into the grass, and then, dropping<br>even the pretence of making for the Club, took a bee-line for<br>Verrall, Elizabeth following. Either woman would have died on the<br>rack rather than admit that she was doing anything but take a<br>short-cut. Verrall saw them coming, swore, and reined in his pony.<br>He could not very well cut them dead now that they were coming<br>openly to accost him. The damned cheek of these women! He rode<br>slowly towards them with a sulky expression on his face, chivvying<br>the polo-ball with small strokes.<br><br>'Good morning, Mr Verrall!' Mrs Lackersteen called out in a voice<br>of saccharine, twenty yards away.<br><br>'Morning!' he returned surlily, having seen her face and set her<br>down as one of the usual scraggy old boiling-fowls of an Indian<br>station.<br><br>The next moment Elizabeth came level with her aunt. She had taken<br>off her spectacles and was swinging her Terai hat on her hand.<br>What did she care for sunstroke? She was perfectly aware of the<br>prettiness of her cropped hair. A puff of wind--oh, those blessed<br>breaths of wind, coming from nowhere in the stifling hot-weather<br>days!--had caught her cotton frock and blown it against her,<br>showing the outline of her body, slender and strong like a tree.<br>Her sudden appearance beside the older, sun-scorched woman was a<br>revelation to Verrall. He started so that the Arab mare felt it<br>and would have reared on her hind legs, and he had to tighten the<br>rein. He had not known until this moment, not having bothered to<br>inquire, that there were any YOUNG women in Kyauktada.<br><br>'My niece,' Mrs Lackersteen said.<br><br>He did not answer, but he had thrown away the polo-stick, and he<br>took off his topi. For a moment he and Elizabeth remained gazing<br>at one another. Their fresh faces were unmarred in the pitiless<br>light. The grass-seeds were tickling Elizabeth's shins so that it<br>was agony, and without her spectacles she could only see Verrall<br>and his horse as a whitish blur. But she was happy, happy! Her<br>heart bounded and the blood flowed into her face, dyeing it like a<br>thin wash of aquarelle. The thought, 'A peach, by Christ!' moved<br>almost fiercely through Verrall's mind. The sullen Indians,<br>holding the ponies' heads, gazed curiously at the scene, as though<br>the beauty of the two young people had made its impression even on<br>them.<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen broke the silence, which had lasted half a minute.<br><br>'You know, Mr Verrall,' she said somewhat archly, 'we think it<br>RATHER unkind of you to have neglected us poor people all this<br>time. When we're so PINING for a new face at the Club.'<br><br>He was still looking at Elizabeth when he answered, but the change<br>in his voice was remarkable.<br><br>'I've been meaning to come for some days. Been so fearfully busy--<br>getting my men into their quarters and all that. I'm sorry,' he<br>added--he was not in the habit of apologizing, but really, he had<br>decided, this girl was rather an exceptional bit of stuff--'I'm<br>sorry about not answering your note.'<br><br>'Oh, not at all! We QUITE understood. But we do hope we shall see<br>you at the Club this evening! Because, you know,' she concluded<br>even more archly, 'if you disappoint us any longer, we shall begin<br>to think you rather a NAUGHTY young man!'<br><br>'I'm sorry,' he repeated. 'I'll be there this evening.'<br><br>There was not much more to be said, and the two women walked on to<br>the Club. But they stayed barely five minutes. The grass-seeds<br>were causing their shins such torment that they were obliged to<br>hurry home and change their stockings at once.<br><br>Verrall kept his promise and was at the Club that evening. He<br>arrived a little earlier than the others, and he had made his<br>presence thoroughly felt before being in the place five minutes.<br>As Ellis entered the Club the old butler darted out of the card-<br>room and waylaid him. He was in great distress, the tears rolling<br>down his cheeks.<br><br>'Sir! Sir!'<br><br>'What the devil's the matter now!' said Ellis.<br><br>'Sir! Sir! New master been beating me, sir!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'BEATING me sir!' His voice rose on the 'beating' with a long<br>tearful wail--'be-e-e-eating!'<br><br>'Beating you? Do you good. Who's been beating you?'<br><br>'New master, sir. Military Police sahib. Beating me with his<br>foot, sir--HERE!' He rubbed himself behind.<br><br>'Hell!' said Ellis.<br><br>He went into the lounge. Verrall was reading the Field, and<br>invisible except for Palm Beach trouser-ends and two lustrous<br>sooty-brown shoes. He did not trouble to stir at hearing someone<br>else come into the room. Ellis halted.<br><br>'Here, you--what's your name--Verrall!'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Have you been kicking our butler?'<br><br>Verrall's sulky blue eye appeared round the corner of the Field,<br>like the eye of a crustacean peering round a rock.<br><br>'What?' he repeated shortly.<br><br>'I said, have you been kicking our bloody butler?'<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>'Then what the hell do you mean by it?'<br><br>'Beggar gave me his lip. I sent him for a whisky and soda, and he<br>brought it warm. I told him to put ice in it, and he wouldn't--<br>talked some bloody rot about saving the last pieces of ice. So I<br>kicked his bottom. Serve him right.'<br><br>Ellis turned quite grey. He was furious. The butler was a piece<br>of Club property and not to be kicked by strangers. But what most<br>angered Ellis was the thought that Verrall quite possibly suspected<br>him of being SORRY for the butler--in fact, of disapproving of<br>kicking AS SUCH.<br><br>'Serve him right? I dare say it bloody well did serve him right.<br>But what in hell's that got to do with it? Who are YOU to come<br>kicking our servants?'<br><br>'Bosh, my good chap. Needed kicking. You've let your servants get<br>out of hand here.'<br><br>'You damned, insolent young tick, what's it got to do with YOU if<br>he needed kicking? You're not even a member of this Club. It's<br>our job to kick the servants, not yours.'<br><br>Verrall lowered the Field and brought his other eye into play. His<br>surly voice did not change its tone. He never lost his temper with<br>a European; it was never necessary.<br><br>'My good chap, if anyone gives me lip I kick his bottom. Do you<br>want me to kick yours?'<br><br>All the fire went out of Ellis suddenly. He was not afraid, he had<br>never been afraid in his life; only, Verrall's eye was too much for<br>him. That eye could make you feel as though you were under<br>Niagara! The oaths wilted on Ellis's lips; his voice almost<br>deserted him. He said querulously and even plaintively:<br><br>'But damn it, he was quite right not to give you the last bit of<br>ice. Do you think we only buy ice for you? We can only get the<br>stuff twice a week in this place.'<br><br>'Rotten bad management on your part, then,' said Verrall, and<br>retired behind the Field, content to let the matter drop.<br><br>Ellis was helpless. The calm way in which Verrall went back to his<br>paper, quite genuinely forgetting Ellis's existence, was maddening.<br>Should he not give the young swab a good, rousing kick?<br><br>But somehow, the kick was never given. Verrall had earned many<br>kicks in his life, but he had never received one and probably never<br>would. Ellis seeped helplessly back to the card-room, to work off<br>his feelings on the butler, leaving Verrall in possession of the<br>lounge.<br><br>As Mr Macgregor entered the Club gate he heard the sound of music.<br>Yellow chinks of lantern-light showed through the creeper that<br>covered the tennis-screen. Mr Macgregor was in a happy mood this<br>evening. He had promised himself a good, long talk with Miss<br>Lackersteen--such an exceptionally intelligent girl, that!--and he<br>had a most interesting anecdote to tell her (as a matter of fact,<br>it had already seen the light in one of those little articles of<br>his in Blackwood's) about a dacoity that had happened in Sagaing in<br>1913. She would love to hear it, he knew. He rounded the tennis-<br>screen expectantly. On the court, in the mingled light of the<br>waning moon and of lanterns slung among the trees, Verrall and<br>Elizabeth were dancing. The chokras had brought out chairs and a<br>table for the gramophone, and round these the other Europeans were<br>sitting or standing. As Mr Macgregor halted at the corner of the<br>court, Verrall and Elizabeth circled round and glided past him,<br>barely a yard away. They were dancing very close together, her<br>body bent backwards under his. Neither noticed Mr Macgregor.<br><br>Mr Macgregor made his way round the court. A chilly, desolate<br>feeling had taken possession of his entrails. Good-bye, then, to<br>his talk with Miss Lackersteen! It was an effort to screw his face<br>into its usual facetious good-humour as he came up to the table.<br><br>'A Terpsichorean evening!' he remarked in a voice that was doleful<br>in spite of himself.<br><br>No one answered. They were all watching the pair on the tennis<br>court. Utterly oblivious of the others, Elizabeth and Verrall<br>glided round and round, round and round, their shoes sliding easily<br>on the slippery concrete. Verrall danced as he rode, with<br>matchless grace. The gramophone was playing 'Show Me the Way to Go<br>Home,' which was then going round the world like a pestilence and<br>had got as far as Burma:<br><br><br>'Show me the way to go home,<br>I'm tired an' I wanna go to bed;<br>I had a little drink 'bout an hour ago,<br>An' it's gone right TO my head!' etc.<br><br><br>The dreary, depressing trash floated out among the shadowy trees<br>and the streaming scents of flowers, over and over again, for Mrs<br>Lackersteen was putting the gramophone needle back to the start<br>when it neared the centre. The moon climbed higher, very yellow,<br>looking, as she rose from the murk of dark clouds at the horizon,<br>like a sick woman creeping out of bed. Verrall and Elizabeth<br>danced on and on, indefatigably, a pale voluptuous shape in the<br>gloom. They moved in perfect unison like some single animal. Mr<br>Macgregor, Ellis, Westfield and Mr Lackersteen stood watching them,<br>their hands in their pockets, finding nothing to say. The<br>mosquitoes came nibbling at their ankles. Someone called for<br>drinks, but the whisky was like ashes in their mouths. The bowels<br>of all four older men were twisted with bitter envy.<br><br>Verrall did not ask Mrs Lackersteen for a dance, nor, when he and<br>Elizabeth finally sat down, did he take any notice of the other<br>Europeans. He merely monopolized Elizabeth for half an hour more,<br>and then, with a brief good night to the Lackersteens and not a<br>word to anyone else, left the Club. The long dance with Verrall<br>had left Elizabeth in a kind of dream. He had asked her to come<br>out riding with him! He was going to lend her one of his ponies!<br>She never even noticed that Ellis, angered by her behaviour, was<br>doing his best to be openly rude. It was late when the Lackersteens<br>got home, but there was no sleep yet for Elizabeth or her aunt.<br>They were feverishly at work till midnight, shortening a pair of Mrs<br>Lackersteen's jodhpurs, and letting out the calves, to fit<br>Elizabeth.<br><br>'I hope, dear, you CAN ride a horse?' said Mrs Lackersteen.<br><br>'Oh, of course! I've ridden ever such a lot, at home.'<br><br>She had ridden perhaps a dozen times in all, when she was sixteen.<br>No matter, she would manage somehow! She would have ridden a<br>tiger, if Verrall were to accompany her.<br><br>When at last the jodhpurs were finished and Elizabeth had tried<br>them on, Mrs Lackersteen sighed to see her. She looked ravishing<br>in jodhpurs, simply ravishing! And to think that in only a day or<br>two they had got to go back to camp, for weeks, months perhaps,<br>leaving Kyauktada and this most DESIRABLE young man! The pity of<br>it! As they moved to go upstairs Mrs Lackersteen paused at the<br>door. It had come into her head to make a great and painful<br>sacrifice. She took Elizabeth by the shoulders and kissed her with<br>a more real affection than she had ever shown.<br><br>'My dear, it would be such a SHAME for you to go away from<br>Kyauktada just now!'<br><br>'It would, rather.'<br><br>'Then I'll tell you what, dear. We WON'T go back to that horrid<br>jungle! Your uncle shall go alone. You and I shall stay in<br>Kyauktada.' <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/16.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/18.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
