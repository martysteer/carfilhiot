<h2>Chapter 20</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Next morning there was great excitement in Kyauktada, for the long-<br>rumoured rebellion had at last broken out. Flory heard only a<br>vague report of it at the time. He had gone back to camp as soon<br>as he felt fit to march after the drunken night, and it was not<br>until several days later that he learned the true history of the<br>rebellion, in a long, indignant letter from Dr Veraswami.<br><br>The doctor's epistolary style was queer. His syntax was shaky and<br>he was as free with capital letters as a seventeenth-century<br>divine, while in the use of italics he rivalled Queen Victoria.<br>There were eight pages of his small but sprawling handwriting.<br><br><br>MY DEAR FRIEND [the letter ran],--You will much regret to hear that<br>the WILES OF THE CROCODILE have matured. The rebellion--the SO-<br>CALLED rebellion--is all over and finished. And it has been, alas!<br>a more Bloody affair than I had hoped should have been the case.<br><br>All has fallen out as I have prophesied to you it would be. On the<br>day when you came back to Kyauktada U Po Kyin's SPIES have informed<br>him that the poor unfortunate men whom he have Deluded are<br>assembling in the jungle near Thongwa. The same night he sets out<br>secretly with U Lugale, the Police Inspector, who is as great a<br>Rogue as he, if that could be, and twelve constables. They make a<br>swift raid upon Thongwa and surprise the rebels, of whom they are<br>only Seven!! in a ruined field hut in the jungle. Also Mr Maxwell,<br>who have heard rumours of the rebellion, came across from his camp<br>bringing his Rifle and was in time to join U Po Kyin and the police<br>in their attack on the hut. The next morning the clerk Ba Sein,<br>who is U Po Kyin's JACKALL and DIRTY WORKER, have orders to raise<br>the cry of rebellion as Sensationally as possible, which was done,<br>and Mr Macgregor, Mr Westfield and Lieutenant Verrall all rush out<br>to Thongwa carrying fifty sepoys armed with rifles besides Civil<br>Police. But they arrive to find it is all over and U Po Kyin was<br>sitting under a big teak tree in the middle of the village and<br>PUTTING ON AIRS and lecturing the villages, whereat they are all<br>bowing very frightened and touching the ground with their foreheads<br>and swearing they will be forever loyal to the Government, and the<br>rebellion is already at an end. The SO-CALLED weiksa, who is no<br>other than a circus conjurer and the MINION of U Po Kyin, have<br>vanished for parts unknown, but six rebels have been Caught. So<br>there is an end.<br><br>Also I should inform you that there was most regrettably a Death.<br>Mr Maxwell was I think TOO ANXIOUS to use his Rifle and when one of<br>the rebels try to run away he fired and shoot him in the abdomen,<br>at which he died. I think the villagers have some BAD FEELING<br>towards Mr Maxwell because of it. But from the point of view legal<br>all is well for Mr Maxwell, because the men were undoubtedly<br>conspiring against the Government.<br><br>Ah, but, my Friend, I trust that you understand how disastrous may<br>all this be for me! You will realise, I think, what is its bearing<br>upon the Contest between U Po Kyin and myself, and the supreme LEG-<br>UP it must give to him. It is the TRIUMPH OF THE CROCODILE. U Po<br>Kyin is now the Hero of the district. He is the PET of the<br>Europeans. I am told that even Mr Ellis has praised his conduct.<br>If you could witness the abominable Conceitedness and the LIES he<br>is now telling as to how there were not seven rebels but Two<br>Hundred!! and how he crushed upon them revolver in hand--he who<br>only directing operations from a SAFE DISTANCE while the police and<br>Mr Maxwell creep up upon the hut--you would find is veritably<br>Nauseous I assure you. He has had the effrontery to send in an<br>official report of the matter which started, 'By my loyal<br>promptitude and reckless daring', and I hear that positively he had<br>had this Conglomeration of lies written out in readiness days<br>BEFORE THE OCCURRENCE. It is Disgusting. And to think that now<br>when he is at the Height of his triumph he will again begin to<br>calumniate me with all the venom at his disposal etc. etc.<br><br><br>The rebels' entire stock of weapons had been captured. The armoury<br>with which, when their followers were assembled, they had proposed<br>to march upon Kyauktada, consisted of the following:<br><br>Item, one shotgun with a damaged left barrel, stolen from a Forest<br>Officer three years earlier.<br><br>Item, six home-made guns with barrels of zinc piping stolen from<br>the railway. These could be fired, after a fashion, by thrusting a<br>nail through the touch-hole and striking it with a stone.<br><br>Item, thirty-nine twelve-bore cartridges.<br><br>Item, eleven dummy guns carved out of teakwood.<br><br>Item, some large Chinese crackers which were to have been fired in<br>terrorem.<br><br>Later, two of the rebels were sentenced to fifteen years'<br>transportation, three to three years' imprisonment and twenty-five<br>lashes, and one to two years' imprisonment.<br><br>The whole miserable rebellion was so obviously at an end that the<br>Europeans were not considered to be in any danger, and Maxwell had<br>gone back to his camp unguarded. Flory intended to stay in camp<br>until the rains broke, or at least until the general meeting at the<br>Club. He had promised to be in for that, to propose the doctor's<br>election; though now, with his own trouble to think of, the whole<br>business of the intrigue between U Po Kyin and the doctor sickened<br>him.<br><br>More weeks crawled by. The heat was dreadful now. The overdue<br>rain seemed to have bred a fever in the air. Flory was out of<br>health, and worked incessantly, worrying over petty jobs that<br>should have been left to the overseer, and making the coolies and<br>even the servants hate him. He drank gin at all hours, but not<br>even drinking could distract him now. The vision of Elizabeth in<br>Verrall's arms haunted him like a neuralgia or an earache. At any<br>moment it would come upon him, vivid and disgusting, scattering his<br>thoughts, wrenching him back from the brink of sleep, turning his<br>food to dust in his mouth. At times he flew into savage rages, and<br>once even struck Ko S'la. What was worse than all was the DETAIL--<br>the always filthy detail--in which the imagined scene appeared.<br>The very perfection of the detail seemed to prove that it was true.<br><br>Is there anything in the world more graceless, more dishonouring,<br>than to desire a woman whom you will never have? Throughout all<br>these weeks Flory's mind held hardly a thought which was not<br>murderous or obscene. It is the common effect of jealousy. Once<br>he had loved Elizabeth spiritually, sentimentally indeed, desiring<br>her sympathy more than her caresses; now, when he had lost her, he<br>was tormented by the basest physical longing. He did not even<br>idealize her any longer. He saw her now almost as she was--silly,<br>snobbish, heartless--and it made no difference to his longing for<br>her. Does it ever make any difference? At nights when he lay<br>awake, his bed dragged outside the tent for coolness, looking at<br>the velvet dark from which the barking of a gyi sometimes sounded,<br>he hated himself for the images that inhabited his mind. It was so<br>base, this envying of the better man who had beaten him. For it<br>was only envy--even jealousy was too good a name for it. What<br>right had he to be jealous? He had offered himself to a girl who<br>was too young and pretty for him, and she had turned him down--<br>rightly. He had got the snub he deserved. Nor was there any<br>appeal from that decision; nothing would ever make him young again,<br>or take away his birthmark and his decade of lonely debaucheries.<br>He could only stand and look on while the better man took her, and<br>envy him, like--but the simile was not even mentionable. Envy is a<br>horrible thing. It is unlike all other kinds of suffering in that<br>there is no disguising it, no elevating it into tragedy. It is<br>more than merely painful, it is disgusting.<br><br>But meanwhile, was it true, what he suspected? Had Verrall really<br>become Elizabeth's lover? There is no knowing, but on the whole<br>the chances were against it, for, had it been so, there would have<br>been no concealing it in such a place as Kyauktada. Mrs Lackersteen<br>would probably have guessed it, even if the others had not. One<br>thing was certain, however, and that was that Verrall had as yet<br>made no proposal of marriage. A week went by, two weeks, three<br>weeks; three weeks is a very long time in a small Indian station.<br>Verrall and Elizabeth rode together every evening, danced together<br>every night; yet Verrall had never so much as entered the<br>Lackersteens' house. There was endless scandal about Elizabeth, of<br>course. All the Orientals of the town had taken it for granted that<br>she was Verrall's mistress. U Po Kyin's version (he had a way of<br>being essentially right even when he was wrong in detail) was that<br>Elizabeth had been Flory's concubine and had deserted him for<br>Verrall because Verrall paid her more. Ellis, too, was inventing<br>tales about Elizabeth that made Mr Macgregor squirm. Mrs<br>Lackersteen, as a relative, did not hear these scandals, but she was<br>growing nervous. Every evening when Elizabeth came home from her<br>ride she would meet her hopefully, expecting the 'Oh, aunt! What DO<br>you think!'--and then the glorious news. But the news never came,<br>and however carefully she studied Elizabeth's face, she could divine<br>nothing.<br><br>When three weeks had passed Mrs Lackersteen became fretful and<br>finally half angry. The thought of her husband, alone--or rather,<br>not alone--in his camp, was troubling her. After all, she had sent<br>him back to camp in order to give Elizabeth her chance with Verrall<br>(not that Mrs Lackersteen would have put it so vulgarly as that).<br>One evening she began lecturing and threatening Elizabeth in her<br>oblique way. The conversation consisted of a sighing monologue<br>with very long pauses--for Elizabeth made no answer whatever.<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen began with some general remarks, apropos of a<br>photograph in the Tatler, about these fast MODERN girls who went<br>about in beach pyjamas and all that and made themselves so<br>dreadfully CHEAP with men. A girl, Mrs Lackersteen said, should<br>NEVER make herself too cheap with a man; she should make herself--<br>but the opposite of 'cheap' seemed to be 'expensive', and that did<br>not sound at all right, so Mrs Lackersteen changed her tack. She<br>went on to tell Elizabeth about a letter she had had from home with<br>further news of that poor, POOR dear girl who was out in Burma for<br>a while and had so foolishly neglected to get married. Her<br>sufferings had been quite heartrending, and it just showed how glad<br>a girl ought to be to marry anyone, literally ANYONE. It appeared<br>that the poor, poor dear girl had lost her job and been practically<br>STARVING for a long time, and now she had actually had to take a<br>job as a common kitchen maid under a horrid, vulgar cook who<br>bullied her most shockingly. And it seemed that the black beetles<br>in the kitchen were simply beyond belief! Didn't Elizabeth think<br>it too absolutely dreadful? BLACK BEETLES!<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen remained silent for some time, to allow the black<br>beetles to sink in, before adding:<br><br>'SUCH a pity that Mr Verrall will be leaving us when the rains<br>break. Kyauktada will seem quite EMPTY without him!'<br><br>'When do the rains break, usually?' said Elizabeth as indifferently<br>as she could manage.<br><br>'About the beginning of June, up here. Only a week or two now. . . .<br>My dear, it seems absurd to mention it again, but I cannot get out<br>of my head the thought of that poor, poor dear girl in the kitchen<br>among the BLACK BEETLES!'<br><br>Black beetles recurred more than once in Mrs Lackersteen's<br>conversation during the rest of the evening. It was not until the<br>following day that she remarked in the tone of someone dropping an<br>unimportant piece of gossip:<br><br>'By the way, I believe Flory is coming back to Kyauktada at the<br>beginning of June. He said he was going to be in for the general<br>meeting at the Club. Perhaps we might invite him to dinner some<br>time.'<br><br>It was the first time that either of them had mentioned Flory since<br>the day when he had brought Elizabeth the leopard-skin. After<br>being virtually forgotten for several weeks, he had returned to<br>each woman's mind, a depressing pis aller.<br><br>Three days later Mrs Lackersteen sent word to her husband to come<br>back to Kyauktada. He had been in camp long enough to earn a short<br>spell in headquarters. He came back, more florid than ever--<br>sunburn, he explained--and having acquired such a trembling of the<br>hands that he could barely light a cigarette. Nevertheless, that<br>evening he celebrated his return by manoeuvring Mrs Lackersteen out<br>of the house, coming into Elizabeth's bedroom and making a spirited<br>attempt to rape her.<br><br>During all this time, unknown to anyone of importance, further<br>sedition was afoot. The 'weiksa' (now far away, peddling the<br>philosopher's stone to innocent villagers in Martaban) had perhaps<br>done his job a little better than he intended. At any rate, there<br>was a possibility of fresh trouble--some isolated, futile outrage,<br>probably. Even U Po Kyin knew nothing of this yet. But as usual<br>the gods were fighting on his side, for any further rebellion would<br>make the first seem more serious than it had been, and so add to<br>his glory. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/18.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/20.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
