<h2>Chapter 14</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Like long curved needles threading through embroidery, the two<br>canoes that carried Flory and Elizabeth threaded their way up the<br>creek that led inland from the eastern bank of the Irrawaddy. It<br>was the day of the shooting trip--a short afternoon trip, for they<br>could not stay a night in the jungle together. They were to shoot<br>for a couple of hours in the comparative cool of the evening, and<br>be back at Kyauktada in time for dinner.<br><br>The canoes, each hollowed out of a single tree-trunk, glided<br>swiftly, hardly rippling the dark brown water. Water hyacinth with<br>profuse spongy foliage and blue flowers had choked the stream so<br>that the channel was only a winding ribbon four feet wide. The<br>light filtered, greenish, through interlacing boughs. Sometimes<br>one could hear parrots scream overhead, but no wild creatures<br>showed themselves, except once a snake that swam hurriedly away and<br>disappeared among the water hyacinth.<br><br>'How long before we get to the village?' Elizabeth called back to<br>Flory. He was in a larger canoe behind, together with Flo and Ko<br>S'la, paddled by a wrinkly old woman dressed in rags.<br><br>'How far, grandmama?' Flory asked the canoe-woman.<br><br>The old woman took her cigar out of her mouth and rested her paddle<br>on her knees to think. 'The distance a man can shout,' she said<br>after reflection.<br><br>'About half a mile,' Flory translated.<br><br>They had come two miles. Elizabeth's back was aching. The canoes<br>were liable to upset at a careless moment, and you had to sit bolt<br>upright on the narrow backless seat, keeping your feet as well as<br>possible out of the bilge, with dead prawns in it, that sagged to<br>and fro at the bottom. The Burman who paddled Elizabeth was sixty<br>years old, half naked, leaf-brown, with a body as perfect as that<br>of a young man. His face was battered, gentle and humorous. His<br>black cloud of hair, finer than that of most Burmans, was knotted<br>loosely over one ear, with a wisp or two tumbling across his cheek.<br>Elizabeth was nursing her uncle's gun across her knees. Flory had<br>offered to take it, but she had refused; in reality, the feel of it<br>delighted her so much that she could not bring herself to give it<br>up. She had never had a gun in her hand until today. She was<br>wearing a rough skirt with brogue shoes and a silk shirt like a<br>man's, and she knew that with her Terai hat they looked well on<br>her. She was very happy, in spite of her aching back and the hot<br>sweat that tickled her face, and the large, speckled mosquitoes<br>that hummed round her ankles.<br><br>The stream narrowed and the beds of water hyacinth gave place to<br>steep banks of glistening mud, like chocolate. Rickety thatched<br>huts leaned far out over the stream, their piles driven into its<br>bed. A naked boy was standing between two of the huts, flying a<br>green beetle on a piece of thread like a kite. He yelled at the<br>sight of the Europeans, whereat more children appeared from<br>nowhere. The old Burman guided the canoe to a jetty made of a<br>single palm-trunk laid in the mud--it was covered with barnacles<br>and so gave foothold--and sprang out and helped Elizabeth ashore.<br>The others followed with the bags and cartridges, and Flo, as she<br>always did on these occasions, fell into the mud and sank as deep<br>as the shoulder. A skinny old gentleman wearing a magenta paso,<br>with a mole on his cheek from which four yard-long grey hairs<br>sprouted, came forward shikoing and cuffing the heads of the<br>children who had gathered round the jetty.<br><br>'The village headman,' Flory said.<br><br>The old man led the way to his house, walking ahead with an<br>extraordinary crouching gait, like a letter L upside down--the<br>result of rheumatism combined with the constant shikoing needed in<br>a minor Government official. A mob of children marched rapidly<br>after the Europeans, and more and more dogs, all yapping and<br>causing Flo to shrink against Flory's heels. In the doorway of<br>every hut clusters of moonlike, rustic faces gaped at the<br>'Ingaleikma'. The village was darkish under the shade of broad<br>leaves. In the rains the creek would flood, turning the lower<br>parts of the village into a squalid wooden Venice where the<br>villagers stepped from their front doors into their canoes.<br><br>The headman's house was a little bigger than the others, and it had<br>a corrugated iron roof, which, in spite of the intolerable din it<br>made during the rains, was the pride of the headman's life. He had<br>foregone the building of a pagoda, and appreciably lessened his<br>chances of Nirvana, to pay for it. He hastened up the steps and<br>gently kicked in the ribs a youth who was lying asleep on the<br>veranda. Then he turned and shikoed again to the Europeans, asking<br>them to come inside.<br><br>'Shall we go in?' Flory said. 'I expect we shall have to wait half<br>an hour.'<br><br>'Couldn't you tell him to bring some chairs out on the veranda?'<br>Elizabeth said. After her experience in Li Yeik's house she had<br>privately decided that she would never go inside a native house<br>again, if she could help it.<br><br>There was a fuss inside the house, and the headman, the youth and<br>some women dragged forth two chairs decorated in an extraordinary<br>manner with red hibiscus flowers, and also some begonias growing in<br>kerosene tins. It was evident that a sort of double throne had<br>been prepared within for the Europeans. When Elizabeth had sat<br>down the headman reappeared with a teapot, a bunch of very long,<br>bright green bananas, and six coal-black cheroots. But when he had<br>poured her out a cup of tea Elizabeth shook her head, for the tea<br>looked, if possible, worse even than Li Yeik's.<br><br>The headman looked abashed and rubbed his nose. He turned to Flory<br>and asked him whether the young thakin-ma would like some milk in<br>her tea. He had heard that Europeans drank milk in their tea. The<br>villages should, if it were desired, catch a cow and milk it.<br>However, Elizabeth still refused the tea; but she was thirsty, and<br>she asked Flory to send for one of the bottles of soda-water that<br>Ko S'la had brought in his bag. Seeing this, the headman retired,<br>feeling guiltily that his preparations had been insufficient, and<br>left the veranda to the Europeans.<br><br>Elizabeth was still nursing her gun on her knees, while Flory<br>leaned against the veranda rail pretending to smoke one of the<br>headman's cheroots. Elizabeth was pining for the shooting to<br>begin. She plied Flory with innumerable questions.<br><br>'How soon can we start out? Do you think we've got enough<br>cartridges? How many beaters shall we take? Oh, I do so hope we<br>have some luck! You do think we'll get something, don't you?'<br><br>'Nothing wonderful, probably. We're bound to get a few pigeons,<br>and perhaps jungle fowl. They're out of season, but it doesn't<br>matter shooting the cocks. They say there's a leopard round here,<br>that killed a bullock almost in the village last week.'<br><br>'Oh, a leopard! How lovely if we could shoot it!'<br><br>'It's very unlikely, I'm afraid. The only rule with this shooting<br>in Burma is to hope for nothing. It's invariably disappointing.<br>The jungles teem with game, but as often as not you don't even get<br>a chance to fire your gun.'<br><br>'Why is that?'<br><br>'The jungle is so thick. An animal may be five yards away and<br>quite invisible, and half the time they manage to dodge back past<br>the beaters. Even when you see them it's only for a flash of a<br>second. And again, there's water everywhere, so that no animal is<br>tied down to one particular spot. A tiger, for instance, will roam<br>hundreds of miles if it suits him. And with all the game there is,<br>they need never come back to a kill if there's anything suspicious<br>about it. Night after night, when I was a boy, I've sat up over<br>horrible stinking dead cows, waiting for tigers that never came.'<br><br>Elizabeth wriggled her shoulder-blades against the chair. It was a<br>movement that she made sometimes when she was deeply pleased. She<br>loved Flory, really loved him, when he talked like this. The most<br>trivial scrap of information about shooting thrilled her. If only<br>he would always talk about shooting, instead of about books and Art<br>and that mucky poetry! In a sudden burst of admiration she decided<br>that Flory was really quite a handsome man, in his way. He looked<br>so splendidly manly, with his pagri-cloth shirt open at the throat,<br>and his shorts and puttees and shooting boots! And his face,<br>lined, sunburned, like a soldier's face. He was standing with his<br>birthmarked cheek away from her. She pressed him to go on talking.<br><br>'DO tell me some more about tiger-shooting. It's so awfully<br>interesting!'<br><br>He described the shooting, years ago, of a mangy old man-eater who<br>had killed one of his coolies. The wait in the mosquito-ridden<br>machan; the tiger's eyes approaching through the dark jungle, like<br>great green lanterns; the panting, slobbering noise as he devoured<br>the coolie's body, tied to a stake below. Flory told it all<br>perfunctorily enough--did not the proverbial Anglo Indian bore<br>always talk about tiger-shooting?--but Elizabeth wriggled her<br>shoulders delightedly once more. He did not realize how such talk<br>as this reassured her and made up for all the times when he had<br>bored her and disquieted her. Six shock-headed youths came down<br>the path, carrying dahs over their shoulders, and headed by a<br>stringy but active old man with grey hair. They halted in front of<br>the headman's house, and one of them uttered a hoarse whoop,<br>whereat the headman appeared and explained that these were the<br>beaters. They were ready to start now, if the young thakin-ma did<br>not find it too hot.<br><br>They set out. The side of the village away from the creek was<br>protected by a hedge of cactus six feet high and twelve thick.<br>One went up a narrow lane of cactus, then along a rutted, dusty<br>bullock-cart track, with bamboos as tall as flagstaffs growing<br>densely on either side. The beaters marched rapidly ahead in<br>single file, each with his broad dah laid along his forearm. The<br>old hunter was marching just in front of Elizabeth. His longyi was<br>hitched up like a loin-cloth, and his meagre thighs were tattooed<br>with dark blue patterns, so intricate that he might have been<br>wearing drawers of blue lace. A bamboo the thickness of a man's<br>wrist had fallen and hung across the path. The leading beater<br>severed it with an upward flick of his dah; the prisoned water<br>gushed out of it with a diamond-flash. After half a mile they<br>reached the open fields, and everyone was sweating, for they had<br>walked fast and the sun was savage.<br><br>'That's where we're going to shoot, over there,' Flory said.<br><br>He pointed across the stubble, a wide dust-coloured plain, cut up<br>into patches of an acre or two by mud boundaries. It was horribly<br>flat, and lifeless save for the snowy egrets. At the far edge a<br>jungle of great trees rose abruptly, like a dark green cliff. The<br>beaters had gone across to a small tree like a hawthorn twenty<br>yards away. One of them was on his knees, shikoing to the tree and<br>gabbling, while the old hunter poured a bottle of some cloudy<br>liquid on to the ground. The others stood looking on with serious,<br>bored faces, like men in church.<br><br>'What ARE those men doing?' Elizabeth said.<br><br>'Only sacrificing to the local gods. Nats, they call them--a kind<br>of dryad. They're praying to him to bring us good luck.'<br><br>The hunter came back and in a cracked voice explained that they<br>were to beat a small patch of scrub over to the right before<br>proceeding to the main jungle. Apparently the Nat had counselled<br>this. The hunter directed Flory and Elizabeth where to stand,<br>pointing with his dah. The six beaters, plunged into the scrub;<br>they would make a detour and beat back towards the paddy-fields.<br>There were some bushes of the wild rose thirty yards from the<br>jungle's edge, and Flory and Elizabeth took cover behind one of<br>these, while Ko S'la squatted down behind another bush a little<br>distance away, holding Flo's collar and stroking her to keep her<br>quiet. Flory always sent Ko S'la to a distance when he was<br>shooting, for he had an irritating trick of clicking his tongue if<br>a shot was missed. Presently there was a far-off echoing sound--a<br>sound of tapping and strange hollow cries; the beat had started.<br>Elizabeth at once began trembling so uncontrollably that she could<br>not keep her gun-barrel still. A wonderful bird, a little bigger<br>than a thrush, with grey wings and body of blazing scarlet, broke<br>from the trees and came towards them with a dipping flight. The<br>tapping and the cries came nearer. One of the bushes at the<br>jungle's edge waved violently--some large animal was emerging.<br>Elizabeth raised her gun and tried to steady it. But it was only a<br>naked yellow beater, dah in hand. He saw that he had emerged and<br>shouted to the others to join him.<br><br>Elizabeth lowered her gun. 'What's happened?'<br><br>'Nothing. The beat's over.'<br><br>'So there was nothing there!' she cried in bitter disappointment.<br><br>'Never mind, one never gets anything the first beat. We'll have<br>better luck next time.'<br><br>They crossed the lumpy stubble, climbing over the mud boundaries<br>that divided the fields, and took up their position opposite the<br>high green wall of the jungle. Elizabeth had already learned how<br>to load her gun. This time the beat had hardly started when Ko<br>S'la whistled sharply.<br><br>'Look out!' Flory cried. 'Quick, here they come!'<br><br>A flight of green pigeons were dashing towards them at incredible<br>speed, forty yards up. They were like a handful of catapulted<br>stones whirling through the sky. Elizabeth was helpless with<br>excitement. For a moment she could not move, then she flung her<br>barrel into the air, somewhere in the direction of the birds, and<br>tugged violently at the trigger. Nothing happened--she was pulling<br>at the trigger-guard. Just as the birds passed overhead she found<br>the triggers and pulled both of them simultaneously. There was a<br>deafening roar and she was thrown backwards a pace with her collar-<br>bone almost broken. She had fired thirty yards behind the birds.<br>At the same moment she saw Flory turn and level his gun. Two of<br>the pigeons, suddenly checked in their flight, swirled over and<br>dropped to the ground like arrows. Ko S'la yelled, and he and Flo<br>raced after them.<br><br>'Look out!' said Flory, 'here's an imperial pigeon. Let's have<br>him!'<br><br>A large heavy bird, with flight much slower than the others, was<br>flapping overhead. Elizabeth did not care to fire after her<br>previous failure. She watched Flory thrust a cartridge into the<br>breech and raise his gun, and the white plume of smoke leapt up<br>from the muzzle. The bird planed heavily down, his wing broken.<br>Flo and Ko S'la came running excitedly up, Flo with the big<br>imperial pigeon in her mouth, and Ko S'la grinning and producing<br>two green pigeons from his Kachin bag.<br><br>Flory took one of the little green corpses to show to Elizabeth.<br>'Look at it. Aren't they lovely things? The most beautiful bird<br>in Asia.'<br><br>Elizabeth touched its smooth feathers with her finger-tip. It<br>filled her with bitter envy, because she had not shot it. And yet<br>it was curious, but she felt almost an adoration for Flory now that<br>she had seen how he could shoot.<br><br>'Just look at its breast-feathers; like a jewel. It's murder to<br>shoot them. The Burmese say that when you kill one of these birds<br>they vomit, meaning to say, "Look, here is all I possess, and I've<br>taken nothing of yours. Why do you kill me?" I've never seen one<br>do it, I must admit.'<br><br>'Are they good to eat?'<br><br>'Very. Even so, I always feel it's a shame to kill them.'<br><br>'I wish I could do it like you do!' she said enviously.<br><br>'It's only a knack, you'll soon pick it up. You know how to hold<br>your gun, and that's more than most people do when they start.'<br><br>However, at the next two beats, Elizabeth could hit nothing. She<br>had learned not to fire both barrels at once, but she was too<br>paralysed with excitement ever to take aim. Flory shot several<br>more pigeons, and a small bronze-wing dove with back as green as<br>verdigris. The jungle fowl were too cunning to show themselves,<br>though one could hear them cluck-clucking all round, and once or<br>twice the sharp trumpet-call of a cock. They were getting deeper<br>into the jungle now. The light was greyish, with dazzling patches<br>of sunlight. Whichever way one looked one's view was shut in by<br>the multitudinous ranks of trees, and the tangled bushes and<br>creepers that struggled round their bases like the sea round the<br>piles of a pier. It was so dense, like a bramble bush extending<br>mile after mile, that one's eyes were oppressed by it. Some of the<br>creepers were huge, like serpents. Flory and Elizabeth struggled<br>along narrow game-tracks, up slippery banks, thorns tearing at<br>their clothes. Both their shirts were drenched with sweat. It was<br>stifling hot, with a scent of crushed leaves. Sometimes for<br>minutes together invisible cidadas would keep up a shrill, metallic<br>pinging like the twanging of a steel guitar, and then, by stopping,<br>make a silence that startled one.<br><br>As they were walking to the fifth beat they came to a great peepul<br>tree in which, high up, one could hear imperial pigeons cooing. It<br>was a sound like the far-off lowing of cows. One bird fluttered<br>out and perched alone on the topmost bough, a small greyish shape.<br><br>'Try a sitting shot,' Flory said to Elizabeth. 'Get your sight on<br>him and pull off without waiting. Don't shut your left eye.'<br><br>Elizabeth raised her gun, which had begun trembling as usual. The<br>beaters halted in a group to watch, and some of them could not<br>refrain from clicking their tongues; they thought it queer and<br>rather shocking to see a woman handle a gun. With a violent effort<br>of will Elizabeth kept her gun still for a second, and pulled the<br>trigger. She did not hear the shot; one never does when it has<br>gone home. The bird seemed to jump upwards from the bough, then<br>down it came, tumbling over and over, and stuck in a fork ten yards<br>up. One of the beaters laid down his dah and glanced appraisingly<br>at the tree; then he walked to a great creeper, thick as a man's<br>thigh and twisted like a stick of barley sugar, that hung far out<br>from a bough. He ran up the creeper as easily as though it had<br>been a ladder, walked upright along the broad bough, and brought<br>the pigeon to the ground. He put it limp and warm into Elizabeth's<br>hand.<br><br>She could hardly give it up, the feel of it so ravished her. She<br>could have kissed it, hugged it to her breast. All the men, Flory<br>and Ko S'la and the beaters, smiled at one another to see her<br>fondling the dead bird. Reluctantly, she gave it to Ko S'la to put<br>in the bag. She was conscious of an extraordinary desire to fling<br>her arms round Flory's neck and kiss him; and in some way it was<br>the killing of the pigeon that made her feel this.<br><br>After the fifth beat the hunter explained to Flory that they must<br>cross a clearing that was used for growing pineapples, and would<br>beat another patch of jungle beyond. They came out into sunlight,<br>dazzling after the jungle gloom. The clearing was an oblong of an<br>acre or two hacked out of the jungle like a patch mown in long<br>grass, with the pineapples, prickly cactus-like plants, growing in<br>rows, almost smothered by weeds. A low hedge of thorns divided the<br>field in the middle. They had nearly crossed the field when there<br>was a sharp cock-a-doodle-doo from beyond the hedge.<br><br>'Oh, listen!' said Elizabeth, stopping. 'Was that a jungle cock?'<br><br>'Yes. They come out to feed about this time.'<br><br>'Couldn't we go and shoot him?'<br><br>'We'll have a try if you like. They're cunning beggars. Look,<br>we'll stalk up the hedge until we get opposite where he is. We'll<br>have to go without making a sound.'<br><br>He sent Ko S'la and the beaters on, and the two of them skirted the<br>field and crept along the hedge. They had to bend double to keep<br>themselves out of sight. Elizabeth was in front. The hot sweat<br>trickled down her face, tickling her upper lip, and her heart was<br>knocking violently. She felt Flory touch her heel from behind.<br>Both of them stood upright and looked over the hedge together.<br><br>Ten yards away a little cock the size of a bantam, was pecking<br>vigorously at the ground. He was beautiful, with his long silky<br>neck-feathers, bunched comb and arching, laurel-green tail. There<br>were six hens with him, smaller brown birds, with diamond-shaped<br>feathers like snake-scales on their backs. All this Elizabeth and<br>Flory saw in the space of a second, then with a squawk and a whirr<br>the birds were up and flying like bullets for the jungle. Instantly,<br>automatically as it seemed, Elizabeth raised her gun and fired. It<br>was one of those shots where there is no aiming, no consciousness of<br>the gun in one's hand, when one's mind seems to fly behind the<br>charge and drive it to the mark. She knew the bird was doomed even<br>before she pulled the trigger. He tumbled, showered feathers thirty<br>yards away. 'Good shot, good shot!' cried Flory. In their<br>excitement both of them dropped their guns, broke through the thorn<br>hedge and raced side by side to where the bird lay.<br><br>'Good shot!' Flory repeated, as excited as she. 'By Jove, I've<br>never seen anyone kill a flying bird their first day, never! You<br>got your gun off like lightning. It's marvellous!'<br><br>They were kneeling face to face with the dead bird between them.<br>With a shock they discovered that their hands, his right and her<br>left, were clasped tightly together. They had run to the place<br>hand-in-hand without noticing it.<br><br>A sudden stillness came on them both, a sense of something<br>momentous that must happen. Flory reached across and took her<br>other hand. It came yieldingly, willingly. For a moment they<br>knelt with their hands clasped together. The sun blazed upon them<br>and the warmth breathed out of their bodies; they seemed to be<br>floating upon clouds of heat and joy. He took her by the upper<br>arms to draw her towards him.<br><br>Then suddenly he turned his head away and stood up, pulling<br>Elizabeth to her feet. He let go of her arms. He had remembered<br>his birthmark. He dared not do it. Not here, not in daylight!<br>The snub it invited was too terrible. To cover the awkwardness of<br>the moment he bent down and picked up the jungle cock.<br><br>'It was splendid,' he said. 'You don't need any teaching. You can<br>shoot already. We'd better get on to the next beat.'<br><br>They had just crossed the hedge and picked up their guns when there<br>was a series of shouts from the edge of the jungle. Two of the<br>beaters were running towards them with enormous leaps, waving their<br>arms wildly in the air.<br><br>'What is it?' Elizabeth said.<br><br>'I don't know. They've seen some animal or other. Something good,<br>by the look of them.'<br><br>'Oh, hurrah! Come on!'<br><br>They broke into a run and hurried across the field, breaking<br>through the pineapples and the stiff prickly weeds. Ko S'la and<br>five of the beaters were standing in a knot all talking at once,<br>and the other two were beckoning excitedly to Flory and Elizabeth.<br>As they came up they saw in the middle of the group an old woman<br>who was holding up her ragged longyi with one hand and gesticulating<br>with a big cigar in the other. Elizabeth could hear some word<br>that sounded like 'Char' repeated over and over again.<br><br>'What is it they're saying?' she said.<br><br>The beaters came crowding round Flory, all talking eagerly and<br>pointing into the jungle. After a few questions he waved his hand<br>to silence them and turned to Elizabeth:<br><br>'I say, here's a bit of luck! This old girl was coming through the<br>jungle, and she says that at the sound of the shot you fired just<br>now, she saw a leopard run across the path. These fellows know<br>where he's likely to hide. If we're quick they may be able to<br>surround him before he sneaks away, and drive him out. Shall we<br>try it?'<br><br>'Oh, do let's! Oh, what awful fun! How lovely, how lovely if we<br>could get that leopard!'<br><br>'You understand it's dangerous? We'll keep close together and<br>it'll probably be all right, but it's never absolutely safe on<br>foot. Are you ready for that?'<br><br>'Oh, of course, of course! I'm not frightened. Oh, do let's be<br>quick and start!'<br><br>'One of you come with us, and show us the way,' he said to the<br>beaters. 'Ko S'la, put Flo on the leash and go with the others.<br>She'll never keep quiet with us. We'll have to hurry,' he added to<br>Elizabeth.<br><br>Ko S'la and the beaters hurried off along the edge of the jungle.<br>They would strike in and begin beating farther up. The other<br>beater, the same youth who had climbed the tree after the pigeon,<br>dived into the jungle, Flory and Elizabeth following. With short<br>rapid steps, almost running, he led them through a labyrinth of<br>game-tracks. The bushes trailed so low that sometimes one had<br>almost to crawl, and creepers hung across the path like trip-wires.<br>The ground was dusty and silent underfoot. At some landmark in the<br>jungle the beater halted, pointed to the ground as a sign that this<br>spot would do, and put his finger on his lips to enjoin silence.<br>Flory took four SG cartridges from his pockets and took Elizabeth's<br>gun to load it silently.<br><br>There was a faint rustling behind them, and they all started. A<br>nearly naked youth with a pellet-bow, come goodness knows whence,<br>had parted the bushes. He looked at the beater, shook his head and<br>pointed up the path. There was a dialogue of signs between the two<br>youths, then the beater seemed to agree. Without speaking all four<br>stole forty yards along the path, round a bend, and halted again.<br>At the same moment a frightful pandemonium of yells, punctuated by<br>barks from Flo, broke out a few hundred yards away.<br><br>Elizabeth felt the beater's hand on her shoulder, pushing her<br>downwards. They all four squatted down under cover of a prickly<br>bush, the Europeans in front, the Burmans behind. In the distance<br>there was such a tumult of yells and the rattle of dahs against<br>tree-trunks that one could hardly believe six men could make so<br>much noise. The beaters were taking good care that the leopard<br>should not turn back upon them. Elizabeth watched some large, pale<br>yellow ants marching like soldiers over the thorns of the bush.<br>One fell on to her hand and crawled up her forearm. She dared not<br>move to brush it away. She was praying silently, 'Please God, let<br>the leopard come! Oh please, God, let the leopard come!'<br><br>There was a sudden loud pattering on the leaves. Elizabeth raised<br>her gun, but Flory shook his head sharply and pushed the barrel<br>down again. A jungle fowl scuttled across the path with long noisy<br>strides.<br><br>The yells of the beaters seemed hardly to come any closer, and<br>this end of the jungle the silence was like a pall. The ant on<br>Elizabeth's arm bit her painfully and dropped to the ground. A<br>dreadful despair had begun to form in her heart; the leopard was<br>not coming, he had slipped away somewhere, they had lost him. She<br>almost wished they had never heard of the leopard, the disappointment<br>was so agonizing. Then she felt the beater pinch her elbow. He was<br>craning his face forward, his smooth, dull yellow cheek only a few<br>inches from her own; she could smell the coco-nut oil in his hair.<br>His coarse lips were puckered as in a whistle; he had heard<br>something. Then Flory and Elizabeth heard it too, the faintest<br>whisper, as though some creature of air were gliding through the<br>jungle, just brushing the ground with its foot. At the same moment<br>the leopard's head and shoulders emerged from the undergrowth,<br>fifteen yards down the path.<br><br>He stopped with his forepaws on the path. They could see his low,<br>flat-eared head, his bare eye-tooth and his thick, terrible<br>forearm. In the shadow he did not look yellow but grey. He was<br>listening intently. Elizabeth saw Flory spring to his feet, raise<br>his gun and pull the trigger instantly. The shot roared, and<br>almost simultaneously there was a heavy crash as the brute dropped<br>flat in the weeds. 'Look out!' Flory cried, 'he's not done for!'<br>He fired again, and there was a fresh thump as the shot went home.<br>The leopard gasped. Flory threw open his gun and felt in his<br>pocket for a cartridge, then flung all his cartridges on to the<br>path and fell on his knees, searching rapidly among them.<br><br>'Damn and blast it!' he cried. 'There isn't a single SG among<br>them. Where in hell did I put them?'<br><br>The leopard had disappeared as he fell. He was thrashing about in<br>the undergrowth like a great, wounded snake, and crying out with a<br>snarling, sobbing noise, savage and pitiful. The noise seemed to<br>be coming nearer. Every cartridge Flory turned up had 6 or 8<br>marked on the end. The rest of the large-shot cartridges had, in<br>fact, been left with Ko S'la. The crashing and snarling were now<br>hardly five yards away, but they could see nothing, the jungle was<br>so thick.<br><br>The two Burmans were crying out 'Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!' The sound<br>of 'Shoot! Shoot!' got farther away--they were skipping for the<br>nearest climbable trees. There was a crash in the undergrowth so<br>close that it shook the bush by which Elizabeth was standing.<br><br>'By God, he's almost on us!' Flory said. 'We must turn him<br>somehow. Let fly at the sound.'<br><br>Elizabeth raised her gun. Her knees were knocking like castanets,<br>but her hand was as steady as stone. She fired rapidly, once,<br>twice. The crashing noise receded. The leopard was crawling away,<br>crippled but swift, and still invisible.<br><br>'Well done! You've scared him,' Flory said.<br><br>'But he's getting away! He's getting away!' Elizabeth cried,<br>dancing about in agitation. She made to follow him. Flory jumped<br>to his feet and pulled her back.<br><br>'No fear! You stay here. Wait!'<br><br>He slipped two of the small-shot cartridges into his gun and ran<br>after the sound of the leopard. For a moment Elizabeth could not<br>see either beast or man, then they reappeared in a bare patch<br>thirty yards away. The leopard was writhing along on his belly,<br>sobbing as he went. Flory levelled his gun and fired at four<br>yards' distance. The leopard jumped like a cushion when one hits<br>it, then rolled over, curled up and lay still. Flory poked the<br>body with his gun-barrel. It did not stir.<br><br>'It's all right, he's done for,' he called. 'Come and have a look<br>at him.'<br><br>The two Burmans jumped down from their tree, and they and Elizabeth<br>went across to where Flory was standing. The leopard--it was a<br>male--was lying curled up with his head between his forepaws. He<br>looked much smaller than he had looked alive; he looked rather<br>pathetic, like a dead kitten. Elizabeth's knees were still<br>quivering. She and Flory stood looking down at the leopard, close<br>together, but not clasping hands this time.<br><br>It was only a moment before Ko S'la and the others came up,<br>shouting with glee. Flo gave one sniff at the dead leopard, then<br>down went her tail and she bolted fifty yards, whimpering. She<br>could not be induced to come near him again. Everyone squatted<br>down round the leopard and gazed at him. They stroked his<br>beautiful white belly, soft as a hare's, and squeezed his broad<br>pugs to bring out the claws, and pulled back his black lips to<br>examine the fangs. Presently two of the beaters cut down a tall<br>bamboo and slung the leopard upon it by his paws, with his long<br>tail trailing down, and then they marched back to the village in<br>triumph. There was no talk of further shooting, though the light<br>still held. They were all, including the Europeans, too anxious to<br>get home and boast of what they had done.<br><br>Flory and Elizabeth walked side by side across the stubble field.<br>The others were thirty yards ahead with the guns and the leopard,<br>and Flo was slinking after them a long way in the rear. The sun<br>was going down beyond the Irrawaddy. The light shone level across<br>the field, gilding the stubble stalks, and striking into their<br>faces with a yellow, gentle beam. Elizabeth's shoulder was almost<br>touching Flory's as they walked. The sweat that had drenched their<br>shirts had dried again. They did not talk much. They were happy<br>with that inordinate happiness that comes of exhaustion and<br>achievement, and with which nothing else in life--no joy of either<br>the body or the mind--is even able to be compared.<br><br>'The leopard skin is yours,' Flory said as they approached the<br>village.<br><br>'Oh, but you shot him!'<br><br>'Never mind, you stick to the skin. By Jove, I wonder how many of<br>the women in this country would have kept their heads like you did!<br>I can just see them screaming and fainting. I'll get the skin<br>cured for you in Kyauktada jail. There's a convict there who can<br>cure skins as soft as velvet. He's doing a seven-year sentence, so<br>he's had time to learn the job.'<br><br>'Oh well, thanks awfully.'<br><br>No more was said for the present. Later, when they had washed off<br>the sweat and dirt, and were fed and rested, they would meet again<br>at the Club. They made no rendezvous, but it was understood<br>between them that they would meet. Also, it was understood that<br>Flory would ask Elizabeth to marry him, though nothing was said<br>about this either.<br><br>At the village Flory paid the beaters eight annas each, superintended<br>the skinning of the leopard, and gave the headman a bottle of beer<br>and two of the imperial pigeons. The skin and skull were packed<br>into one of the canoes. All the whiskers had been stolen, in spite<br>of Ko S'la's efforts to guard them. Some young men of the village<br>carried off the carcass in order to eat the heart and various other<br>organs, the eating of which they believed would make them strong and<br>swift like the leopard. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/12.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/14.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
