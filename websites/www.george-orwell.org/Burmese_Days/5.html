<h2>Chapter 6</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The morning sunlight slanted up the maidan and struck, yellow as<br>goldleaf, against the white face of the bungalow. Four black-<br>purple crows swooped down and perched on the veranda rail, waiting<br>their chance to dart in and steal the bread and butter that Ko S'la<br>had set down beside Flory's bed. Flory crawled through the<br>mosquito net, shouted to Ko S'la to bring him some gin, and then<br>went into the bathroom and sat for a while in a zinc tub of water<br>that was supposed to be cold. Feeling better after the gin, he<br>shaved himself. As a rule he put off shaving until the evening,<br>for his beard was black and grew quickly.<br><br>While Flory was sitting morosely in his bath, Mr Macgregor, in<br>shorts and singlet on the bamboo mat laid for the purpose in his<br>bedroom, was struggling with Numbers 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of<br>Nordenflycht's 'Physical Jerks for the Sedentary'. Mr Macgregor<br>never, or hardly ever, missed his morning exercises. Number 8<br>(flat on the back, raise legs to the perpendicular without bending<br>knees) was downright painful for a man of forty-three; Number 9<br>(flat on the back, rise to a sitting posture and touch toes with<br>tips of fingers) was even worse. No matter, one must keep fit! As<br>Mr Macgregor lunged painfully in the direction of his toes, a<br>brick-red shade flowed upwards from his neck and congested his face<br>with a threat of apoplexy. The sweat gleamed on his large, tallowy<br>breasts. Stick it out, stick it out! At all costs one must keep<br>fit. Mohammed Ali, the bearer, with Mr Macgregor's clean clothes<br>across his arm, watched through the half-open door. His narrow,<br>yellow, Arabian face expressed neither comprehension nor curiosity.<br>He had watched these contortions--a sacrifice, he dimly imagined,<br>to some mysterious and exacting god--every morning for five years.<br><br>At the same time, too, Westfield, who had gone out early, was<br>leaning against the notched and ink-stained table of the police<br>station, while the fat Sub-inspector interrogated a suspect whom<br>two constables were guarding. The suspect was a man of forty, with<br>a grey, timorous face, dressed only in a ragged longyi kilted to<br>the knee, beneath which his lank, curved shins were speckled with<br>tick-bites.<br><br>'Who is this fellow?' said Westfield.<br><br>'Thief, sir. We catch him in possession of this ring with two<br>emeralds very-dear. No explanation. How could he--poor coolie--<br>own a emerald ring? He have stole it.'<br><br>He turned ferociously upon the suspect, advanced his face tomcat-<br>fashion till it was almost touching the other's, and roared in an<br>enormous voice:<br><br>'You stole the ring!'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'You are an old offender!'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'You have been in prison!'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'Turn round!' bellowed the Sub-inspector on an inspiration. 'Bend<br>over!'<br><br>The suspect turned his grey face in agony towards Westfield, who<br>looked away. The two constables seized him, twisted him round and<br>bent him over; the Sub-inspector tore off his longyi, exposing his<br>buttocks.<br><br>'Look at this, sir!' He pointed to some scars. 'He have been<br>flogged with bamboos. He is an old offender. THEREFORE he stole<br>the ring!'<br><br>'All right, put him in the clink,' said Westfield moodily, as he<br>lounged away from the table with his hands in his pockets. At the<br>bottom of his heart he loathed running in these poor devils of<br>common thieves. Dacoits, rebels--yes; but not these poor cringing<br>rats! 'How many have you got in the clink now, Maung Ba?' he said.<br><br>'Three, sir.'<br><br>The lock-up was upstairs, a cage surrounded by six-inch wooden<br>bars, guarded by a constable armed with a carbine. It was very<br>dark, stifling hot, and quite unfurnished, except for an earth<br>latrine that stank to heaven. Two prisoners were squatting at the<br>bars, keeping their distance from a third, an Indian coolie, who<br>was covered from head to foot with ringworm like a coat of mail. A<br>stout Burmese woman, wife of a constable, was kneeling outside the<br>cage ladling rice and watery dahl into tin pannikins.<br><br>'Is the food good?' said Westfield.<br><br>'It is good, most holy one,' chorused the prisoners.<br><br>The Government provided for the prisoners' food at the rate of two<br>annas and a half per meal per man, out of which the constable's<br>wife looked to make a profit of one anna.<br><br>Flory went outside and loitered down the compound, poking weeds<br>into the ground with his stick. At that hour there were beautiful<br>faint colours in everything--tender green of leaves, pinkish brown<br>of earth and tree-trunks--like aquarelle washes that would vanish<br>in the later glare. Down on the maidan flights of small, low-<br>flying brown doves chased one another to and fro, and bee-eaters,<br>emerald-green, curvetted like slow swallows. A file of sweepers,<br>each with his load half hidden beneath his garment, were marching<br>to some dreadful dumping-hole that existed on the edge of the<br>jungle. Starveling wretches, with stick-like limbs and knees too<br>feeble to be straightened, draped in earth-coloured rags, they were<br>like a procession of shrouded skeletons walking.<br><br>The mali was breaking ground for a new flower-bed, down by the<br>pigeon-cote that stood near the gate. He was a lymphatic, half-<br>witted Hindu youth, who lived his life in almost complete silence,<br>because he spoke some Manipur dialect which nobody else understood,<br>not even his Zerbadi wife. His tongue was also a size too large<br>for his mouth. He salaamed low to Flory, covering his face with<br>his hand, then swung his mamootie aloft again and hacked at the dry<br>ground with heavy, clumsy strokes, his tender back-muscles quivering.<br><br>A sharp grating scream that sounded like 'Kwaaa!' came from the<br>servants quarters. Ko S'la's wives had begun their morning<br>quarrel. The tame fighting cock, called Nero, strutted zigzag down<br>the path, nervous of Flo, and Ba Pe came out with a bowl of paddy<br>and they fed Nero and the pigeons. There were more yells from the<br>servants' quarters, and the gruffer voices of men trying to stop<br>the quarrel. Ko S'la suffered a great deal from his wives. Ma Pu,<br>the first wife, was a gaunt hard-faced woman, stringy from much<br>child-bearing, and Ma Yi, the 'little wife', was a fat, lazy cat<br>some years younger. The two women fought incessantly when Flory<br>was in headquarters and they were together. Once when Ma Pu was<br>chasing Ko S'la with a bamboo, he had dodged behind Flory for<br>protection, and Flory had received a nasty blow on the leg.<br><br>Mr Macgregor was coming up the road, striding briskly and swinging<br>a thick walking-stick. He was dressed in khaki pagri-cloth shirt,<br>drill shorts and a pigsticker topi. Besides his exercises, he took<br>a brisk two-mile walk every morning when he could spare the time.<br><br>'Top o' the mornin' to ye!' he called to Flory in a hearty<br>matutinal voice, putting on an Irish accent. He cultivated a<br>brisk, invigorating, cold-bath demeanour at this hour of the<br>morning. Moreover, the libellous article in the Burmese Patriot,<br>which he had read overnight, had hurt him, and he was affecting a<br>special cheeriness to conceal this.<br><br>'Morning!' Flory called back as heartily as he could manage.<br><br>Nasty old bladder of lard! he thought, watching Mr Macgregor up the<br>road. How his bottom did stick out in those tight khaki shorts.<br>Like one of those beastly middle-aged scoutmasters, homosexuals<br>almost to a man, that you see photographs of in the illustrated<br>papers. Dressing himself up in those ridiculous clothes and<br>exposing his pudgy, dimpled knees, because it is the pukka sahib<br>thing to take exercise before breakfast--disgusting!<br><br>A Burman came up the hill, a splash of white and magenta. It was<br>Flory's clerk, coming from the tiny office, which was not far from<br>the church. Reaching the gate, he shikoed and presented a grimy<br>envelope, stamped Burmese-fashion on the point of the flap.<br><br>'Good morning, sir.'<br><br>'Good morning. What's this thing?'<br><br>'Local letter, your honour. Come this morning's post. Anonymous<br>letter, I think, sir.'<br><br>'Oh bother. All right, I'll be down to the office about eleven.'<br><br>Flory opened the letter. It was written on a sheet of foolscap,<br>and it ran:<br><br><br>MR JOHN FLORY,<br><br>SIR,--I the undersigned beg to suggest and WARN to your honour<br>certain useful pieces of information whereby your honour will be<br>much profited, sir.<br><br>Sir, it has been remarked in Kyauktada your honour's great<br>friendship and intimacy with Dr Veraswami, the Civil Surgeon,<br>frequenting with him, inviting him to your house, etc. Sir, we beg<br>to inform you that the said Dr Veraswami is NOT A GOOD MAN and in<br>no ways a worthy friend of European gentlemen. The doctor is<br>eminently dishonest, disloyal and corrupt public servant. Coloured<br>water is he providing to patients at the hospital and selling drugs<br>for own profit, besides many bribes, extortions, etc. Two<br>prisoners has he flogged with bamboos, afterwards rubbing chilis<br>into the place if relatives do not send money. Besides this he is<br>implicated with the Nationalist Party and lately provided material<br>for a very evil article which appeared in the Burmese Patriot<br>attacking Mr Macgregor, the honoured Deputy Commissioner.<br><br>He is also sleeping by force with female patients at the hospital.<br><br>Wherefore we are much hoping that your honour will ESCHEW same Dr<br>Veraswami and not consort with persons who can bring nothing but<br>evil upon your honour.<br><br>And shall ever pray for your honour's long health and prosperity.<br><br>(Signed) A FRIEND.<br><br><br>The letter was written in the shaky round hand of the bazaar<br>letter-writer, which resembled a copybook exercise written by a<br>drunkard. The letter-writer, however, would never have risen to<br>such a word as 'eschew'. The letter must have been dictated by a<br>clerk, and no doubt it came ultimately from U Po Kyin. From 'the<br>crocodile', Flory reflected.<br><br>He did not like the tone of the letter. Under its appearance of<br>servility it was obviously a covert threat. 'Drop the doctor or we<br>will make it hot for you', was what it said in effect. Not that<br>that mattered greatly; no Englishman ever feels himself in real<br>danger from an Oriental.<br><br>Flory hesitated with the letter in his hands. There are two things<br>one can do with an anonymous letter. One can say nothing about it,<br>or one can show it to the person whom it concerns. The obvious,<br>the decent course was to give the letter to Dr Veraswami and let<br>him take what action he chose.<br><br>And yet--it was safer to keep out of this business altogether. It<br>is so important (perhaps the most important of all the Ten Precepts<br>of the pukka sahib) not to entangle oneself in 'native' quarrels.<br>With Indians there must be no loyalty, no real friendship.<br>Affection, even love--yes. Englishmen do often love Indians--<br>native officers, forest rangers, hunters, clerks, servants. Sepoys<br>will weep like children when their colonel retires. Even intimacy<br>is allowable, at the right moments. But alliance, partisanship,<br>never! Even to know the rights and wrongs of a 'native' quarrel is<br>a loss of prestige.<br><br>If he published the letter there would be a row and an official<br>inquiry, and, in effect, he would have thrown in his lot with the<br>doctor against U Po Kyin. U Po Kyin did not matter, but there were<br>the Europeans; if he, Flory, were too conspicuously the doctor's<br>partisan, there might be hell to pay. Much better to pretend that<br>the letter had never reached him. The doctor was a good fellow,<br>but as to championing him against the full fury of pukka sahibdom--<br>ah, no, no! What shall it profit a man if he save his own soul and<br>lose the whole world? Flory began to tear the letter across. The<br>danger of making it public was very slight, very nebulous. But one<br>must beware of the nebulous dangers in India. Prestige, the breath<br>of life, is itself nebulous. He carefully tore the letter into<br>small pieces and threw them over the gate.<br><br>At this moment there was a terrified scream, quite different from<br>the voices of Ko S'la's wives. The mali lowered his mamootie and<br>gaped in the direction of the sound, and Ko S'la, who had also<br>heard it, came running bareheaded from the servants' quarters,<br>while Flo sprang to her feet and yapped sharply. The scream was<br>repeated. It came from the jungle behind the house, and it was an<br>English voice, a woman's, crying out in terror.<br><br>There was no way out of the compound by the back. Flory scrambled<br>over the gate and came down with his knee bleeding from a splinter.<br>He ran round the compound fence and into the jungle, Flo following.<br>Just behind the house, beyond the first fringe of bushes, there was<br>a small hollow, which, as there was a pool of stagnant water in it,<br>was frequented by buffaloes from Nyaunglebin. Flory pushed his way<br>through the bushes. In the hollow an English girl, chalk-faced,<br>was cowering against a bush, while a huge buffalo menaced her with<br>its crescent-shaped horns. A hairy calf, no doubt the cause of the<br>trouble, stood behind. Another buffalo, neck-deep in the slime of<br>the pool, looked on with mild prehistoric face, wondering what was<br>the matter.<br><br>The girl turned an agonized face to Flory as he appeared. 'Oh, do<br>be quick!' she cried, in the angry, urgent tone of people who are<br>frightened. 'Please! Help me! Help me!'<br><br>Flory was too astonished to ask any questions. He hastened towards<br>her, and, in default of a stick, smacked the buffalo sharply on the<br>nose. With a timid, loutish movement the great beast turned aside,<br>then lumbered off followed by the calf. The other buffalo also<br>extricated itself from the slime and lolloped away. The girl threw<br>herself against Flory, almost into his arms, quite overcome by her<br>fright.<br><br>'Oh, thank you, thank you! Oh, those dreadful things! What ARE<br>they? I thought they were going to kill me. What horrible<br>creatures! What ARE they?'<br><br>They're only water-buffaloes. They come from the village up<br>there.'<br><br>'Buffaloes?'<br><br>'Not wild buffaloes--bison, we call those. They're just a kind of<br>cattle the Burmans keep. I say, they've given you a nasty shock.<br>I'm sorry.'<br><br>She was still clinging closely to his arm, and he could feel her<br>shaking. He looked down, but he could not see her face, only the<br>top of her head, hatless, with yellow hair as short as a boy's.<br>And he could see one of the hands on his arm. It was long,<br>slender, youthful, with the mottled wrist of a schoolgirl. It was<br>several years since he had seen such a hand. He became conscious<br>of the soft, youthful body pressed against his own, and the warmth<br>breathing out of it; whereat something seemed to thaw and grow warm<br>within him.<br><br>'It's all right, they're gone,' he said. 'There's nothing to be<br>frightened of.'<br><br>The girl was recovering from her fright, and she stood a little<br>away from him, with one hand still on his arm. 'I'm all right,'<br>she said. 'It's nothing. I'm not hurt. They didn't touch me. It<br>was only their looking so awful.'<br><br>'They're quite harmless really. Their horns are set so far back<br>that they can't gore you. They're very stupid brutes. They only<br>pretend to show fight when they've got calves.'<br><br>They had stood apart now, and a slight embarrassment came over them<br>both immediately. Flory had already turned himself sidelong to<br>keep his birthmarked cheek away from her. He said:<br><br>'I say, this is a queer sort of introduction! I haven't asked yet<br>how you got here. Wherever did you come from--if it's not rude to<br>ask?'<br><br>'I just came out of my uncle's garden. It seemed such a nice<br>morning, I thought I'd go for a walk. And then those dreadful<br>things came after me. I'm quite new to this country, you see.'<br><br>'Your uncle? Oh, of course! You're Mr Lackersteen's niece. We<br>heard you were coming. I say, shall we get out on to the maidan?<br>There'll be a path somewhere. What a start for your first morning<br>in Kyauktada! This'll give you rather a bad impression of Burma,<br>I'm afraid.'<br><br>'Oh no; only it's all rather strange. How thick these bushes grow!<br>All kind of twisted together and foreign-looking. You could get<br>lost here in a moment. Is that what they call jungle?'<br><br>'Scrub jungle. Burma's mostly jungle--a green, unpleasant land, I<br>call it. I wouldn't walk through that grass if I were you. The<br>seeds get into your stockings and work their way into your skin.'<br><br>He let the girl walk ahead of him, feeling easier when she could<br>not see his face. She was tallish for a girl, slender, and wearing<br>a lilac-coloured cotton frock. From the way she moved her limbs he<br>did not think she could be much past twenty. He had not noticed<br>her face yet, except to see that she wore round tortoise-shell<br>spectacles, and that her hair was as short as his own. He had<br>never seen a woman with cropped hair before, except in the<br>illustrated papers.<br><br>As they emerged on to the maidan he stepped level with her, and she<br>turned to face him. Her face was oval, with delicate, regular<br>features; not beautiful, perhaps, but it seemed so there, in Burma,<br>where all Englishwomen are yellow and thin. He turned his head<br>sharply aside, though the birthmark was away from her. He could<br>not bear her to see his worn face too closely. He seemed to feel<br>the withered skin round his eyes as though it had been a wound.<br>But he remembered that he had shaved that morning, and it gave him<br>courage. He said:<br><br>'I say, you must be a bit shaken up after this business. Would you<br>like to come into my place and rest a few minutes before you go<br>home? It's rather late to be out of doors without a hat, too.'<br><br>'Oh, thank you, I would,' the girl said. She could not, he<br>thought, know anything about Indian notions of propriety. 'Is this<br>your house here?'<br><br>'Yes. We must go round the front way. I'll have the servants get<br>a sunshade for you. This sun's dangerous for you, with your short<br>hair.'<br><br>They walked up the garden path. Flo was frisking round them and<br>trying to draw attention to herself. She always barked at strange<br>Orientals, but she liked the smell of a European. The sun was<br>growing stronger. A wave of blackcurrant scent flowed from the<br>petunias beside the path, and one of the pigeons fluttered to the<br>earth, to spring immediately into the air again as Flo made a grab<br>at it. Flory and the girl stopped with one consent, to look at the<br>flowers. A pang of unreasonable happiness had gone through them<br>both.<br><br>'You really mustn't go out in this sun without a hat on,' he<br>repeated, and somehow there was an intimacy in saying it. He could<br>not help referring to her short hair somehow, it seemed to him so<br>beautiful. To speak of it was like touching it with his hand.<br><br>'Look, your knee's bleeding,' the girl said. 'Did you do that when<br>you were coming to help me?'<br><br>There was a slight trickle of blood, which was drying, purple, on<br>his khaki stocking. 'It's nothing,' he said, but neither of them<br>felt at that moment that it was nothing. They began chattering<br>with extraordinary eagerness about the flowers. The girl 'adored'<br>flowers, she said. And Flory led her up the path, talking<br>garrulously about one plant and another.<br><br>'Look how these phloxes grow. They go on blooming for six months<br>in this country. They can't get too much sun. I think those<br>yellow ones must be almost the colour of primroses. I haven't seen<br>a primrose for fifteen years, nor a wallflower, either. Those<br>zinnias are fine, aren't they?--like painted flowers, with those<br>wonderful dead colours. These are African marigolds. They're<br>coarse things, weeds almost, but you can't help liking them,<br>they're so vivid and strong. Indians have an extraordinary<br>affection for them; wherever Indians have been you find marigolds<br>growing, even years afterwards when the jungle has buried every<br>other trace of them. But I wish you'd come into the veranda and<br>see the orchids. I've some I must show that are just like bells of<br>gold--but literally like gold. And they smell of honey, almost<br>overpoweringly. That's about the only merit of this beastly<br>country, it's good for flowers. I hope you're fond of gardening?<br>It's our greatest consolation, in this country.'<br><br>'Oh, I simply adore gardening,' the girl said.<br><br>They went into the veranda. Ko S'la had hurriedly put on his ingyi<br>and his best pink silk gaungbaung, and he appeared from within the<br>house with a tray on which were a decanter of gin, glasses and a<br>box of cigarettes. He laid them on the table, and, eyeing the girl<br>half apprehensively, put his hands flat together and shikoed.<br><br>'I expect it's no use offering you a drink at this hour of the<br>morning?' Flory said. 'I can never get it into my servant's head<br>that SOME people can exist without gin before breakfast.'<br><br>He added himself to the number by waving away the drink Ko S'la<br>offered him. The girl had sat down in the wicker chair that Ko<br>S'la had set out for her at the end of the veranda. The dark-<br>leaved orchids hung behind her head, with gold trusses of blossom,<br>breathing out warm honey-scent. Flory was standing against the<br>veranda rail, half facing the girl, but keeping his birthmarked<br>cheek hidden.<br><br>'What a perfectly divine view you have from here,' she said as she<br>looked down the hillside.<br><br>'Yes, isn't it? Splendid, in this yellow light, before the sun<br>gets going. I love that sombre yellow colour the maidan has, and<br>those gold mohur trees, like blobs of crimson. And those hills at<br>the horizon, almost black. My camp is on the other side of those<br>hills,' he added.<br><br>The girl, who was long-sighted, took off her spectacles to look<br>into the distance. He noticed that her eyes were very clear pale<br>blue, paler than a harebell. And he noticed the smoothness of the<br>skin round her eyes, like a petal, almost. It reminded him of his<br>age and his haggard face again, so that he turned a little more<br>away from her. But he said on impulse:<br><br>'I say, what a bit of luck you coming to Kyauktada! You can't<br>imagine the difference it makes to us to see a new face in these<br>places. After months of our own miserable society, and an<br>occasional official on his rounds and American globe-trotters<br>skipping up the Irrawaddy with cameras. I suppose you've come<br>straight from England?'<br><br>'Well, not England exactly. I was living in Paris before I came<br>out here. My mother was an artist, you see.'<br><br>'Paris! Have you really lived in Paris? By Jove, just fancy<br>coming from Paris to Kyauktada! Do you know, it's positively<br>difficult, in a hole like this, to believe that there ARE such<br>places as Paris.'<br><br>'Do you like Paris?' she said.<br><br>'I've never even seen it. But, good Lord, how I've imagined it!<br>Paris--it's all a kind of jumble of pictures in my mind; cafes and<br>boulevards and artists' studios and Villon and Baudelaire and<br>Maupassant all mixed up together. You don't know how the names of<br>those European towns sound to us, out here. And did you really<br>live in Paris? Sitting in cafes with foreign art students,<br>drinking white wine and talking about Marcel Proust?'<br><br>'Oh, that kind of thing, I suppose,' said the girl, laughing.<br><br>'What differences you'll find here! It's not white wine and Marcel<br>Proust here. Whisky and Edgar Wallace more likely. But if you<br>ever want books, you might find something you liked among mine.<br>There's nothing but tripe in the Club library. But of course I'm<br>hopelessly behind the times with my books. I expect you'll have<br>read everything under the sun.'<br><br>'Oh no. But of course I simply adore reading,' the girl said.<br><br>'What it means to meet somebody who cares for books! I mean books<br>worth reading, not that garbage in the Club libraries. I do hope<br>you'll forgive me if I overwhelm you with talk. When I meet<br>somebody who's heard that books exist, I'm afraid I go off like a<br>bottle of warm beer. It's a fault you have to pardon in these<br>countries.'<br><br>'Oh, but I love talking about books. I think reading is so<br>wonderful. I mean, what would life be without it? It's such a--<br>such a--'<br><br>'Such a private Alsatia. Yes--'<br><br>They plunged into an enormous and eager conversation, first about<br>books, then about shooting, in which the girl seemed to have an<br>interest and about which she persuaded Flory to talk. She was<br>quite thrilled when he described the murder of an elephant which he<br>had perpetrated some years earlier. Flory scarcely noticed, and<br>perhaps the girl did not either, that it was he who did all the<br>talking. He could not stop himself, the joy of chattering was so<br>great. And the girl was in a mood to listen. After all, he had<br>saved her from the buffalo, and she did not yet believe that those<br>monstrous brutes could be harmless; for the moment he was almost a<br>hero in her eyes. When one does get any credit in this life, it is<br>usually for something that one has not done. It was one of those<br>times when the conversation flows so easily, so naturally, that one<br>could go on talking forever. But suddenly, their pleasure<br>evaporated, they started and fell silent. They had noticed that<br>they were no longer alone.<br><br>At the other end of the veranda, between the rails, a coal-black<br>moustachioed face was peeping with enormous curiosity. It belonged<br>to old Sammy, the 'Mug' cook. Behind him stood Ma Pu, Ma Yi, Ko<br>S'la's four eldest children, an unclaimed naked child, and two old<br>women who had come down from the village upon the news that an<br>'Ingaleikma' was on view. Like carved teak statues with footlong<br>cigars stuck in their wooden faces, the two old creatures gazed at<br>the 'Ingaleikma' as English yokels might gaze at a Zulu warrior in<br>full regalia.<br><br>'Those people . . .' the girl said uncomfortably, looking towards<br>them.<br><br>Sammy, seeing himself detected, looked very guilty and pretended to<br>be rearranging his pagri. The rest of the audience were a little<br>abashed, except for the two wooden-faced old women.<br><br>'Dash their cheek!' Flory said. A cold pang of disappointment went<br>through him. After all, it would not do for the girl to stay on<br>his veranda any longer. Simultaneously both he and she had<br>remembered that they were total strangers. Her face had turned a<br>little pink. She began putting on her spectacles.<br><br>'I'm afraid an English girl is rather a novelty to these people,'<br>he said. 'They don't mean any harm. Go away!' he added angrily,<br>waving his hand at the audience, whereupon they vanished.<br><br>'Do you know, if you don't mind, I think I ought to be going,' the<br>girl said. She had stood up. 'I've been out quite a long time.<br>They may be wondering where I've got to.'<br><br>'Must you really? It's quite early. I'll see that you don't have<br>to go home bareheaded in the sun.'<br><br>'I ought really--' she began again.<br><br>She stopped, looking at the doorway. Ma Hla May was emerging on to<br>the veranda.<br><br>Ma Hla May came forward with her hand on her hip. She had come<br>from within the house, with a calm air that asserted her right to<br>be there. The two girls stood face to face, less than six feet<br>apart.<br><br>No contrast could have been stranger; the one faintly coloured as<br>an apple-blossom, the other dark and garish, with a gleam almost<br>metallic on her cylinder of ebony hair and the salmon-pink silk of<br>her longyi. Flory thought he had never noticed before how dark Ma<br>Hla May's face was, and how outlandish her tiny, stiff body,<br>straight as a soldier's, with not a curve in it except the vase-<br>like curve of her hips. He stood against the veranda rail and<br>watched the two girls, quite disregarded. For the best part of a<br>minute neither of them could take her eyes from the other; but<br>which found the spectacle more grotesque, more incredible, there is<br>no saying.<br><br>Ma Hla May turned her face round to Flory, with her black brows,<br>thin as pencil lines, drawn together. 'Who is this woman?' she<br>demanded sullenly.<br><br>He answered casually, as though giving an order to a servant:<br><br>'Go away this instant. If you make any trouble I will afterwards<br>take a bamboo and beat you till not one of your ribs is whole.'<br><br>Ma Hla May hesitated, shrugged her small shoulders and disappeared.<br>And the other, gazing after her, said curiously:<br><br>'Was that a man or a woman?'<br><br>'A woman,' he said. 'One of the servants' wives, I believe. She<br>came to ask about the laundry, that was all.'<br><br>'Oh, is THAT what Burmese women are like? They ARE queer little<br>creatures! I saw a lot of them on my way up here in the train, but<br>do you know, I thought they were all boys. They're just like a<br>kind of Dutch doll, aren't they?'<br><br>She had begun to move towards the veranda steps, having lost<br>interest in Ma Hla May now that she had disappeared. He did not<br>stop her, for he thought Ma Hla May quite capable of coming back<br>and making a scene. Not that it mattered much, for neither girl<br>knew a word of the other's language. He called to Ko S'la, and Ko<br>S'la came running with a big oiled-silk umbrella with bamboo ribs.<br>He opened it respectfully at the foot of the steps and held it over<br>the girl's head as she came down. Flory went with them as far as<br>the gate. They stopped to shake hands, he turning a little<br>sideways in the strong sunlight, hiding his birthmark.<br><br>'My fellow here will see you home. It was ever so kind of you to<br>come in. I can't tell you how glad I am to have met you. You'll<br>make such a difference to us here in Kyauktada.'<br><br>'Good-bye, Mr--oh, how funny! I don't even know your name.'<br><br>'Flory, John Flory. And yours--Miss Lackersteen, is it?'<br><br>'Yes. Elizabeth. Good-bye, Mr Flory. And thank you EVER so much.<br>That awful buffalo. You quite saved my life.'<br><br>'It was nothing. I hope I shall see you at the Club this evening?<br>I expect your uncle and aunt will be coming down. Good-bye for the<br>time being, then.'<br><br>He stood at the gate, watching them as they went. Elizabeth--<br>lovely name, too rare nowadays. He hoped she spelt it with a Z.<br>Ko S'la trotted after her at a queer uncomfortable gait, reaching<br>the umbrella over her head and keeping his body as far away from<br>her as possible. A cool breath of wind blew up the hill. It was<br>one of those momentary winds that blow sometimes in the cold<br>weather in Burma, coming from nowhere, filling one with thirst and<br>with nostalgia for cold sea-pools, embraces of mermaids, waterfalls,<br>caves of ice. It rustled through the wide domes of the gold mohur<br>trees, and fluttered the fragments of the anonymous letter that<br>Flory had thrown over the gate half an hour earlier. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/4.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/6.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
