<h2>Chapter 24</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">It was nearly six o'clock in the evening, and the absurd bell in<br>the six-foot tin steeple of the church went clank-clank, clank-<br>clank! as old Mattu pulled the rope within. The rays of the<br>setting sun, refracted by distant rainstorms, flooded the maidan<br>with a beautiful, lurid light. It had been raining earlier in the<br>day, and would rain again. The Christian community of Kyauktada,<br>fifteen in number, were gathering at the church door for the<br>evening service.<br><br>Flory was already there, and Mr Macgregor, grey topi and all, and<br>Mr Francis and Mr Samuel, frisking about in freshly laundered drill<br>suits--for the six-weekly church service was the great social event<br>of their lives. The padre, a tall man with grey hair and a<br>refined, discoloured face, wearing pince-nez, was standing on the<br>church steps in his cassock and surplice, which he had put on in Mr<br>Macgregor's house. He was smiling in an amiable but rather<br>helpless way at four pink-cheeked Karen Christians who had come to<br>make their bows to him; for he did not speak a word of their<br>language nor they of his. There was one other Oriental Christian,<br>a mournful, dark Indian of uncertain race, who stood humbly in the<br>background. He was always present at the church services, but no<br>one knew who he was or why he was a Christian. Doubtless he had<br>been captured and baptized in infancy by the missionaries, for<br>Indians who are converted when adults almost invariably lapse.<br><br>Flory could see Elizabeth coming down the hill, dressed in lilac-<br>colour, with her aunt and uncle. He had seen her that morning at<br>the Club--they had had just a minute alone together before the<br>others came in. He had only asked her one question.<br><br>'Has Verrall gone--for good?'<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>There had been no need to say any more. He had simply taken her by<br>the arms and drawn her towards him. She came willingly, even<br>gladly--there in the clear daylight, merciless to his disfigured<br>face. For a moment she had clung to him almost like a child. It<br>was a though he had saved her or protected her from something. He<br>raised her face to kiss her, and found with surprise that she was<br>crying. There had been no time to talk then, not even to say,<br>'Will you marry me?' No matter, after the service there would be<br>time enough. Perhaps at his next visit, only six weeks hence, the<br>padre would marry them.<br><br>Ellis and Westfield and the new Military Policeman were approaching<br>from the Club, where they had been having a couple of quick ones to<br>last them through the service. The Forest Officer who had been<br>sent to take Maxwell's place, a sallow, tall man, completely bald<br>except for two whisker-like tufts in front of his ears, was<br>following them. Flory had not time to say more than 'Good evening'<br>to Elizabeth when she arrived. Mattu, seeing that everyone was<br>present, stopped ringing the bell, and the clergyman led the way<br>inside, followed by Mr Macgregor, with his topi against his<br>stomach, and the Lackersteens and the native Christians. Ellis<br>pinched Flory's elbow and whispered boozily in his ear:<br><br>'Come on, line up. Time for the snivel-parade. Quick march!'<br><br>He and the Military Policeman went in behind the others, arm-in-<br>arm, with a dancing step--the policeman, till they got inside,<br>wagging his fat behind in imitation of a pwe-dancer. Flory sat<br>down in the same pew as these two, opposite Elizabeth, on her<br>right. It was the first time that he had ever risked sitting with<br>his birthmark towards her. 'Shut your eyes and count twenty-five',<br>whispered Ellis as they sat down, drawing a snigger from the<br>policeman. Mrs Lackersteen had already taken her place at the<br>harmonium, which was no bigger than a writing-desk. Mattu<br>stationed himself by the door and began to pull the punkah--it was<br>so arranged that it only flapped over the front pews, where the<br>Europeans sat. Flo came nosing up the aisle, found Flory's pew and<br>settled down underneath it. The service began.<br><br>Flory was only attending intermittently. He was dimly aware of<br>standing and kneeling and muttering 'Amen' to interminable prayers,<br>and of Ellis nudging him and whispering blasphemies behind his hymn<br>book. But he was too happy to collect his thoughts. Hell was<br>yielding up Eurydice. The yellow light flooded in through the open<br>door, gilding the broad back of Mr Macgregor's silk coat like<br>cloth-of-gold. Elizabeth, across the narrow aisle, was so close to<br>Flory that he could hear every rustle of her dress and feel, as it<br>seemed to him, the warmth of her body; yet he would not look at her<br>even once, lest the others should notice it. The harmonium<br>quavered bronchitically as Mrs Lackersteen struggled to pump<br>sufficient air into it with the sole pedal that worked. The<br>singing was a queer, ragged noise--an earnest booming from Mr<br>Macgregor, a kind of shamefaced muttering from the other Europeans,<br>and from the back a loud, wordless lowing, for the Karen Christians<br>knew the tunes of the hymns but not the words.<br><br>They were kneeling down again. 'More bloody knee-drill,' Ellis<br>whispered. The air darkened, and there was a light patter of rain<br>on the roof; the trees outside rustled, and a cloud of yellow<br>leaves whirled past the window. Flory watched them through the<br>chinks of his fingers. Twenty years ago, on winter Sundays in his<br>pew in the parish church at home, he used to watch the yellow<br>leaves, as at this moment, drifting and fluttering against leaden<br>skies. Was it not possible, now, to begin over again as though<br>those grimy years had never touched him? Through his fingers he<br>glanced sidelong at Elizabeth, kneeling with her head bent and her<br>face hidden in her youthful, mottled hands. When they were<br>married, when they were married! What fun they would have together<br>in this alien yet kindly land! He saw Elizabeth in his camp,<br>greeting him as he came home tired from work and Ko S'la hurried<br>from the tent with a bottle of beer; he saw her walking in the<br>forest with him, watching the hornbills in the peepul trees and<br>picking nameless flowers, and in the marshy grazing-grounds,<br>tramping through the cold-weather mist after snipe and teal. He<br>saw his home as she would remake it. He saw his drawing-room,<br>sluttish and bachelor-like no longer, with new furniture from<br>Rangoon, and a bowl of pink balsams like rosebuds on the table, and<br>books and water-colours and a black piano. Above all the piano!<br>His mind lingered upon the piano--symbol, perhaps because he was<br>unmusical, of civilized and settled life. He was delivered for<br>ever from the sub-life of the past decade--the debaucheries, the<br>lies, the pain of exile and solitude, the dealings with whores and<br>moneylenders and pukka sahibs.<br><br>The clergyman stepped to the small wooden lectern that also served<br>as a pulpit, slipped the band from a roll of sermon paper, coughed,<br>and announced a text. 'In the name of the Father, the Son and the<br>Holy Ghost. Amen.'<br><br>'Cut it short, for Christ's sake,' murmured Ellis.<br><br>Flory did not notice how many minutes passed. The words of the<br>sermon flowed peacefully through his head, an indistinct burbling<br>sound, almost unheard. When they were married, he was still<br>thinking, when they were married--<br><br>Hullo! What was happening?<br><br>The clergyman had stopped short in the middle of a word. He had<br>taken off his pince-nez and was shaking them with a distressed air<br>at someone in the doorway. There was a fearful, raucous scream.<br><br>'Pike-san pay-like! Pike-san pay-like!'<br><br>Everyone jumped in their seats and turned round. It was Ma Hla<br>May. As they turned she stepped inside the church and shoved old<br>Mattu violently aside. She shook her fist at Flory.<br><br>'Pike-san pay-like! Pike-san pay-like! Yes, THAT'S the one I<br>mean--Flory, Flory! (She pronounced it Porley.) That one sitting<br>in front there, with the black hair! Turn round and face me, you<br>coward! Where is the money you promised me?'<br><br>She was shrieking like a maniac. The people gaped at her, too<br>astounded to move or speak. Her face was grey with powder, her<br>greasy hair was tumbling down, her longyi was ragged at the bottom.<br>She looked like a screaming hag of the bazaar. Flory's bowels<br>seemed to have turned to ice. Oh God, God! Must they know--must<br>Elizabeth know--that THAT was the woman who had been his mistress?<br>But there was not a hope, not the vestige of a hope, of any<br>mistake. She had screamed his name over and over again. Flo,<br>hearing the familiar voice, wriggled from under the pew, walked<br>down the aisle and wagged her tail at Ma Hla May. The wretched<br>woman was yelling out a detailed account of what Flory had done to<br>her.<br><br>'Look at me, you white men, and you women, too, look at me! Look<br>how he has ruined me! Look at these rags I am wearing! And he is<br>sitting there, the liar, the coward, pretending not to see me! He<br>would let me starve at his gate like a pariah dog. Ah, but I will<br>shame you! Turn round and look at me! Look at this body that you<br>have kissed a thousand times--look--look--'<br><br>She began actually to tear her clothes open--the last insult of a<br>base-born Burmese woman. The harmonium squeaked as Mrs Lackersteen<br>made a convulsive movement. People had at last found their wits<br>and began to stir. The clergyman, who had been bleating<br>ineffectually, recovered his voice, 'Take that woman outside!' he<br>said sharply.<br><br>Flory's face was ghastly. After the first moment he had turned his<br>head away from the door and set his teeth in a desperate effort to<br>look unconcerned. But it was useless, quite useless. His face was<br>as yellow as bone, and the sweat glistened on his forehead.<br>Francis and Samuel, doing perhaps the first useful deed of their<br>lives, suddenly sprang from their pew, grabbed Ma Hla May by the<br>arms and hauled her outside, still screaming.<br><br>It seemed very silent in the church when they had finally dragged<br>her out of hearing. The scene had been so violent, so squalid,<br>that everyone was upset by it. Even Ellis looked disgusted. Flory<br>could neither speak nor stir. He sat staring fixedly at the altar,<br>his face rigid and so bloodless that the birth-mark seemed to glow<br>upon it like a streak of blue paint. Elizabeth glanced across the<br>aisle at him, and her revulsion made her almost physically sick.<br>She had not understood a word of what Ma Hla May was saying, but<br>the meaning of the scene was perfectly clear. The thought that he<br>had been the lover of that grey-faced, maniacal creature made her<br>shudder in her bones. But worse than that, worse than anything,<br>was his ugliness at this moment. His face appalled her, it was so<br>ghastly, rigid and old. It was like a skull. Only the birthmark<br>seemed alive in it. She hated him now for his birthmark. She had<br>never known till this moment how dishonouring, how unforgivable a<br>thing it was.<br><br>Like the crocodile, U Po Kyin had struck at the weakest spot. For,<br>needless to say, this scene was U Po Kyin's doing. He had seen his<br>chance, as usual, and tutored Ma Hla May for her part with<br>considerable care. The clergyman brought his sermon to an end<br>almost at once. As soon as it was over Flory hurried outside, not<br>looking at any of the others. It was getting dark, thank God. At<br>fifty yards from the church he halted, and watched the others<br>making in couples for the Club. It seemed to him that they were<br>hurrying. Ah, they would, of course! There would be something to<br>talk about at the Club tonight! Flo rolled belly-upwards against<br>his ankles, asking for a game. 'Get out, you bloody brute!' he<br>said, and kicked her. Elizabeth had stopped at the church door.<br>Mr Macgregor, happy chance, seemed to be introducing her to the<br>clergyman. In a moment the two men went on in the direction of Mr<br>Macgregor's house, where the clergyman was to stay for the night,<br>and Elizabeth followed the others, thirty yards behind them. Flory<br>ran after her and caught up with her almost at the Club gate.<br><br>'Elizabeth!'<br><br>She looked round, saw him, turned white, and would have hurried on<br>without a word. But his anxiety was too great, and he caught her<br>by the wrist.<br><br>'Elizabeth! I must--I've got to speak to you!'<br><br>'Let me go, will you!'<br><br>They began to struggle, and then stopped abruptly. Two of the<br>Karens who had come out of the church were standing fifty yards<br>away, gazing at them through the half-darkness with deep interest.<br>Flory began again in a lower tone:<br><br>'Elizabeth, I know I've no right to stop you like this. But I must<br>speak to you, I must! Please hear what I've got to say. Please<br>don't run away from me!'<br><br>'What are you doing? Why are you holding on to my arm? Let me go<br>this instant!'<br><br>'I'll let you go--there, look! But do listen to me, please!<br>Answer me this one thing. After what's happened, can you ever<br>forgive me?'<br><br>'Forgive you? What do you mean, FORGIVE you?'<br><br>'I know I'm disgraced. It was the vilest thing to happen! Only,<br>in a sense it wasn't my fault. You'll see that when you're calmer.<br>Do you think--not now, it was too bad, but later--do you think you<br>can forget it?'<br><br>'I really don't know what you're talking about. Forget it? What<br>has it got to do with ME? I thought it was very disgusting, but<br>it's not MY business. I can't think why you're questioning me like<br>this at all.'<br><br>He almost despaired at that. Her tone and even her words were the<br>very ones she had used in that earlier quarrel of theirs. It was<br>the same move over again. Instead of hearing him out she was going<br>to evade him and put him off--snub him by pretending that he had no<br>claim upon her.<br><br>'Elizabeth! Please answer me. Please be fair to me! It's serious<br>this time. I don't expect you to take me back all at once. You<br>couldn't, when I'm publicly disgraced like this. But, after all,<br>you virtually promised to marry me--'<br><br>'What! Promised to marry you? WHEN did I promise to marry you?'<br><br>'Not in words, I know. But it was understood between us.'<br><br>'Nothing of the kind was understood between us! I think you are<br>behaving in the most horrible way. I'm going along to the Club at<br>once. Good evening!'<br><br>'Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Listen. It's not fair to condemn me<br>unheard. You knew before what I'd done, and you knew that I'd<br>lived a different life since I met you. What happened this evening<br>was only an accident. That wretched woman, who, I admit, was once<br>my--well--'<br><br>'I won't listen, I won't listen to such things! I'm going!'<br><br>He caught her by the wrists again, and this time held her. The<br>Karens had disappeared, fortunately.<br><br>'No, no, you shall hear me! I'd rather offend you to the heart<br>than have this uncertainty. It's gone on week after week, month<br>after month, and I've never once been able to speak straight out to<br>you. You don't seem to know or care how much you make me suffer.<br>But this time you've got to answer me.'<br><br>She struggled in his grip, and she was surprisingly strong. Her<br>face was more bitterly angry than he had ever seen or imagined it.<br>She hated him so that she would have struck him if her hands were<br>free.<br><br>'Let me go! Oh, you beast, you beast, let me go!'<br><br>'My God, my God, that we should fight like this! But what else can<br>I do? I can't let you go without even hearing me. Elizabeth, you<br>MUST listen to me!'<br><br>'I will not! I will not discuss it! What right have you to<br>question me? Let me go!'<br><br>'Forgive me, forgive me! This one question. Will you--not now,<br>but later, when this vile business is forgotten--will you marry<br>me?'<br><br>'No, never, never!'<br><br>'Don't say it like that! Don't make it final. Say no for the<br>present if you like--but in a month, a year, five years--'<br><br>'Haven't I said no? Why must you keep on and on?'<br><br>'Elizabeth, listen to me. I've tried again and again to tell you<br>what you mean to me--oh, it's so useless talking about it! But do<br>try and understand. Haven't I told you something of the life we<br>live here? The sort of horrible death-in-life! The decay, the<br>loneliness, the self-pity? Try and realize what it means, and that<br>you're the sole person on earth who could save me from it.'<br><br>'Will you let me go? Why do you have to make this dreadful scene?'<br><br>'Does it mean nothing to you when I say that I love you? I don't<br>believe you've ever realized what it is that I want from you. If<br>you like, I'd marry you and promise never even touch you with my<br>finger. I wouldn't mind even that, so long as you were with me.<br>But I can't go on with my life alone, always alone. Can't you<br>bring yourself ever to forgive me?'<br><br>'Never, never! I wouldn't marry you if you were the last man on<br>earth. I'd as soon marry the--the sweeper!'<br><br>She had begun crying now. He saw that she meant what she said.<br>The tears came into his own eyes. He said again:<br><br>'For the last time. Remember that it's something to have one<br>person in the world who loves you. Remember that though you'll<br>find men who are richer, and younger, and better in every way than<br>I, you'll never find one who cares for you so much. And though I'm<br>not rich, at least I could make you a home. There's a way of<br>living--civilized, decent--'<br><br>'Haven't we said enough?' she said more calmly. 'Will you let me<br>go before somebody comes?'<br><br>He relaxed his grip on her wrists. He had lost her, that was<br>certain. Like a hallucination, painfully clear, he saw again their<br>home as he had imagined it; he saw their garden, and Elizabeth<br>feeding Nero and the pigeons on the drive by the sulphur-yellow<br>phloxes that grew as high as her shoulder; and the drawing-room,<br>with the water-colours on the walls, and the balsams in the china<br>bowl mirrored by the table, and the book-shelves, and the black<br>piano. The impossible, mythical piano--symbol of everything that<br>that futile accident had wrecked!<br><br>'You should have a piano,' he said despairingly.<br><br>'I don't play the piano.'<br><br>He let her go. It was no use continuing. She was no sooner free<br>of him than she took to her heels and actually ran into the Club<br>garden, so hateful was his presence to her. Among the trees she<br>stopped to take off her spectacles and remove the signs of tears<br>from her face. Oh, the beast, the beast! He had hurt her wrists<br>abominably. Oh, what an unspeakable beast he was! When she<br>thought of his face as it had looked in church, yellow and<br>glistening with the hideous birthmark upon it, she could have<br>wished him dead. It was not what he had done that horrified her.<br>He might have committed a thousand abominations and she could have<br>forgiven him. But not after that shameful, squalid scene, and the<br>devilish ugliness of his disfigured face in that moment. It was,<br>finally, the birthmark that had damned him.<br><br>Her aunt would be furious when she heard that she had refused<br>Flory. And there was her uncle and his leg-pinching--between the<br>two of them, life here would become impossible. Perhaps she would<br>have to go Home unmarried after all. Black beetles! No matter.<br>Anything--spinsterhood, drudgery, anything--sooner than the<br>alternative. Never, never, would she yield to a man who had been<br>so disgraced! Death sooner, far sooner. If there had been<br>mercenary thoughts in her mind an hour ago, she had forgotten them.<br>She did not even remember that Verrall had jilted her and that to<br>have married Flory would have saved her face. She knew only that<br>he was dishonoured and less than a man, and that she hated him as<br>she would have hated a leper or a lunatic. The instinct was deeper<br>than reason or even self-interest, and she could no more have<br>disobeyed it than she could have stopped breathing.<br><br>Flory, as he turned up the hill, did not run, but he walked as fast<br>as he could. What he had to do must be done quickly. It was<br>getting very dark. The wretched Flo, who even now had not grasped<br>that anything serious was the matter, trotted close to his heels,<br>whimpering in a self-pitying manner to reproach him for the kick he<br>had given her. As he came up the path a wind blew through the<br>plaintain trees, rattling the tattered leaves and bringing a scent<br>of damp. It was going to rain again. Ko S'la had laid the dinner-<br>table and was removing some flying beetles that had committed<br>suicide against the petrol-lamp. Evidently he had not heard about<br>the scene in church yet.<br><br>'The holy one's dinner is ready. Will the holy one dine now?'<br><br>'No, not yet. Give me that lamp.'<br><br>He took the lamp, went into the bedroom and shut the door, The<br>stale scent of dust and cigarette-smoke met him, and in the white,<br>unsteady glare of the lamp he could see the mildewed books and the<br>lizards on the wall. So he was back again to this--to the old,<br>secret life--after everything, back where he had been before.<br><br>Was it not possible to endure it! He had endured it before. There<br>were palliatives--books, his garden, drink, work, whoring, shooting,<br>conversations with the doctor.<br><br>No, it was not endurable any longer. Since Elizabeth's coming the<br>power to suffer and above all to hope, which he had thought dead in<br>him, had sprung to new life. The half-comfortable lethargy in<br>which he had lived was broken. And if he suffered now, there was<br>far worse to come. In a little while someone else would marry her.<br>How he could picture it--the moment when he heard the news!--'Did<br>you hear the Lackersteen kid's got off at last? Poor old So-and-<br>so--booked for the altar, God help him,' etc., etc. And the casual<br>question--'Oh, really? When is it to be?'--stiffening one's face,<br>pretending to be uninterested. And then her wedding day approaching,<br>her bridal night--ah, not that! Obscene, obscene. Keep your eyes<br>fixed on that. Obscene. He dragged his tin uniform-case from under<br>the bed, took out his automatic pistol, slid a clip of cartridges<br>into the magazine, and pulled one into the breech.<br><br>Ko S'la was remembered in his will. There remained Flo. He laid<br>his pistol on the table and went outside. Flo was playing with Ba<br>Shin, Ko S'la's youngest son, under the lee of the cookhouse, where<br>the servants had left the remains of a woodfire. She was dancing<br>round him with her small teeth bared, pretending to bite him, while<br>the tiny boy, his belly red in the glow of the embers, smacked<br>weakly at her, laughing, and yet half frightened.<br><br>'Flo! Come here, Flo!'<br><br>She heard him and came obediently, and then stopped short at the<br>bedroom door. She seemed to have grasped now that there was<br>something wrong. She backed a little and stood looking timorously<br>up at him, unwilling to enter the bedroom.<br><br>'Come in here!'<br><br>She wagged her tail, but did not move.<br><br>'Come on, Flo! Good old Flo! Come on!'<br><br>Flo was suddenly stricken with terror. She whined, her tail went<br>down, and she shrank back. 'Come here, blast you!' he cried, and<br>he took her by the collar and flung her into the room, shutting the<br>door behind her. He went to the table for the pistol.<br><br>'No come here! Do as you're told!'<br><br>She crouched down and whined for forgiveness. It hurt him to hear<br>it. 'Come on, old girl! Dear old Flo! Master wouldn't hurt you.<br>Come here!' She crawled very slowly towards his feet, flat on her<br>belly, whining, her head down as though afraid to look at him.<br>When she was a yard away he fired, blowing her skull to fragments.<br><br>Her shattered brain looked like red velvet. Was that what he would<br>look like? The heart, then, not the head. He could hear the<br>servants running out of their quarters and shouting--they must have<br>heard the sound of the shot. He hurriedly tore open his coat and<br>pressed the muzzle of the pistol against his shirt. A tiny lizard,<br>translucent like a creature of gelatine, was stalking a white moth<br>along the edge of the table. Flory pulled the trigger with his<br>thumb.<br><br>As Ko S'la burst into the room, for a moment he saw nothing but the<br>dead body of the dog. Then he saw his master's feet, heels<br>upwards, projecting from beyond the bed. He yelled to the others<br>to keep the children out of the room, and all of them surged back<br>from the doorway with screams. Ko S'la fell on his knees behind<br>Flory's body, at the same moment as Ba Pe came running through the<br>veranda.<br><br>'Has he shot himself?'<br><br>'I think so. Turn him over on his back. Ah, look at that! Run<br>for the Indian doctor! Run for your life!'<br><br>There was a neat hole, no bigger than that made by a pencil passing<br>through a sheet of blotting-paper, in Flory's shirt. He was<br>obviously quite dead. With great difficulty Ko S'la managed to<br>drag him on to the bed, for the other servants refused to touch the<br>body. It was only twenty minutes before the doctor arrived. He<br>had heard only a vague report that Flory was hurt, and had bicycled<br>up the hill at top speed through a storm of rain. He threw his<br>bicycle down in the flower-bed and hurried in through the veranda.<br>He was out of breath, and could not see through his spectacles. He<br>took them off, peering myopically at the bed. 'What iss it, my<br>friend?' he said anxiously. 'Where are you hurt?' Then, coming<br>closer, he saw what was on the bed, and uttered a harsh sound.<br><br>'Ach, what is this? What has happened to him?'<br><br>The doctor fell on his knees, tore Flory's shirt open and put his<br>ear to his chest. An expression of agony came into his face, and<br>he seized the dead man by the shoulders and shook him as though<br>mere violence could bring him to life. One arm fell limply over<br>the edge of the bed. The doctor lifted it back again, and then,<br>with the dead hand between his own, suddenly burst into tears. Ko<br>S'la was standing at the foot of the bed, his brown face full of<br>lines. The doctor stood up, and then losing control of himself for<br>a moment, leaned against the bedpost and wept noisily and<br>grotesquely his back turned on Ko S'la. His fat shoulders were<br>quivering. Presently he recovered himself and turned round again.<br><br>'How did this happen?'<br><br>'We heard two shots. He did it himself, that is certain. I do not<br>know why.'<br><br>'How did you know that he did it on purpose? How do you know that<br>it was not an accident?'<br><br>For answer, Ko S'la pointed silently to Flo's corpse. The doctor<br>thought for a moment, and then, with gentle, practised hands,<br>swathed the dead man in the sheet and knotted it at foot and head.<br>With death, the birthmark had faded immediately, so that it was no<br>more than a faint grey stain.<br><br>'Bury the dog at once. I will tell Mr Macgregor that this happened<br>accidentally while he was cleaning his revolver. Be sure that you<br>bury the dog. Your master was my friend. It shall not be written<br>on his tombstone that he committed suicide.'<br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/22.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/24.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
