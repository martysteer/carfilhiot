<h2>Chapter 3</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Flory turned to the left outside the Club gate and started down the<br>bazaar road, under the shade of the peepul trees. A hundred yards<br>away there was a swirl of music, where a squad of Military<br>Policemen, lank Indians in greenish khaki, were marching back to<br>their lines with a Gurkha boy playing the bagpipes ahead of them.<br>Flory was going to see Dr Veraswami. The doctor's house was a long<br>bungalow of earth-oiled wood, standing on piles, with a large<br>unkempt garden which adjoined that of the Club. The back of the<br>house was towards the road, for it faced the hospital, which lay<br>between it and the river.<br><br>As Flory entered the compound there was a frightened squawk of<br>women and a scurrying within the house. Evidently he had narrowly<br>missed seeing the doctor's wife. He went round to the front of the<br>house and called up to the veranda:<br><br>'Doctor! Are you busy? May I come up?'<br><br>The doctor, a little black and white figure, popped from within the<br>house like a jack-in-the-box. He hurried to the veranda rail,<br>exclaimed effusively:<br><br>'If you may come up! Of course, of course, come up this instant!<br>Ah, Mr Flory, how very delightful to see you! Come up, come up.<br>What drink will you have? I have whisky, beer, vermouth and other<br>European liquors. Ah, my dear friend, how I have been pining for<br>some cultured conversation!'<br><br>The doctor was a small, black, plump man with fuzzy hair and round,<br>credulous eyes. He wore steel-rimmed spectacles, and he was<br>dressed in a badly fitting white drill suit, with trousers bagging<br>concertina-like over clumsy black boots. His voice was eager and<br>bubbling, with a hissing of the s's. As Flory came up the steps<br>the doctor popped back to the end of the veranda and rummaged in a<br>big tin ice-chest, rapidly pulling out bottles of all descriptions.<br>The veranda was wide and dark, with low eaves from which baskets of<br>fern hung, making it seem like a cave behind a waterfall of<br>sunlight. It was furnished with long, cane-bottomed chairs made in<br>the jail, and at one end there was a book-case containing a rather<br>unappetizing little library, mainly books of essays, of the<br>Emerson-Carlyle-Stevenson type. The doctor, a great reader, liked<br>his books to have what he called a 'moral meaning'.<br><br>'Well, doctor,' said Flory--the doctor had meanwhile thrust him<br>into a long chair, pulled out the leg-rests so that he could lie<br>down, and put cigarettes and beer within reach. 'Well, doctor, and<br>how are things? How's the British Empire? Sick of the palsy as<br>usual?'<br><br>'Aha, Mr Flory, she iss very low, very low! Grave complications<br>setting in. Septicaemia, peritonitis and paralysis of the ganglia.<br>We shall have to call in the specialists, I fear. Aha!'<br><br>It was a joke between the two men to pretend that the British<br>Empire was an aged female patient of the doctor's. The doctor had<br>enjoyed this joke for two years without growing tired of it.<br><br>'Ah, doctor,' said Flory, supine in the long chair, 'what a joy to<br>be here after that bloody Club. When I come to your house I feel<br>like a Nonconformist minister dodging up to town and going home<br>with a tart. Such a glorious holiday from THEM'--he motioned with<br>one heel in the direction of the Club--'from my beloved fellow<br>Empire-builders. British prestige, the white man's burden, the<br>pukka sahib sans peur et sans reproche--you know. Such a relief to<br>be out of the stink of it for a little while.'<br><br>'My friend, my friend, now come, come, please! That iss<br>outrageous. You must not say such things of honourable English<br>gentlemen!'<br><br>'You don't have to listen to the honourable gentlemen talking,<br>doctor. I stood it as long as I could this morning. Ellis with<br>his "dirty nigger", Westfield with his jokes, Macgregor with his<br>Latin tags and please give the bearer fifteen lashes. But when<br>they got on to that story about the old havildar--you know, the<br>dear old havildar who said that if the British left India there<br>wouldn't be a rupee or a virgin between--you know; well, I couldn't<br>stand it any longer. It's time that old havildar was put on the<br>retired list. He's been saying the same thing ever since the<br>Jubilee in 'eighty-seven.'<br><br>The doctor grew agitated, as he always did when Flory criticized<br>the Club members. He was standing with his plump white-clad behind<br>balanced against the veranda rail, and sometimes gesticulating.<br>When searching for a word he would nip his black thumb and<br>forefinger together, as though to capture an idea floating in the<br>air.<br><br>'But truly, truly, Mr Flory, you must not speak so! Why iss it<br>that always you are abusing the pukka sahibs, ass you call them?<br>They are the salt of the earth. Consider the great things they<br>have done--consider the great administrators who have made British<br>India what it iss. Consider Clive, Warren Hastings, Dalhousie,<br>Curzon. They were such men--I quote your immortal Shakespeare--<br>ass, take them for all in all, we shall not look upon their like<br>again!'<br><br>'Well, do you want to look upon their like again? I don't.'<br><br>'And consider how noble a type iss the English gentleman! Their<br>glorious loyalty to one another! The public school spirit! Even<br>those of them whose manner iss unfortunate--some Englishmen are<br>arrogant, I concede--have the great, sterling qualities that we<br>Orientals lack. Beneath their rough exterior, their hearts are of<br>gold.'<br><br>'Of gilt, shall we say? There's a kind of spurious good-fellowship<br>between the English and this country. It's a tradition to booze<br>together and swap meals and pretend to be friends, though we all<br>hate each other like poison. Hanging together, we call it. It's<br>a political necessity. Of course drink is what keeps the machine<br>going. We should all go mad and kill one another in a week if it<br>weren't for that. There's a subject for one of your uplift<br>essayists, doctor. Booze as the cement of empire.'<br><br>The doctor shook his head. 'Really, Mr Flory, I know not what it<br>iss that hass made you so cynical. It iss so most unsuitable!<br>You--an English gentleman of high gifts and character--to be<br>uttering seditious opinions that are worthy of the Burmese<br>Patriot!'<br><br>'Seditious?' Flory said. 'I'M not seditious. I don't want the<br>Burmans to drive us out of this country. God forbid! I'm here to<br>make money, like everyone else. All I object to is the slimy white<br>man's burden humbug. The pukka sahib pose. It's so boring. Even<br>those bloody fools at the Club might be better company if we<br>weren't all of us living a lie the whole time.'<br><br>'But, my dear friend, what lie are you living?'<br><br>'Why, of course, the lie that we're here to uplift our poor black<br>brothers instead of to rob them. I suppose it's a natural enough<br>lie. But it corrupts us, it corrupts us in ways you can't imagine.<br>There's an everlasting sense of being a sneak and a liar that<br>torments us and drives us to justify ourselves night and day. It's<br>at the bottom of half our beastliness to the natives. We Anglo-<br>Indians could be almost bearable if we'd only admit that we're<br>thieves and go on thieving without any humbug.'<br><br>The doctor, very pleased, nipped his thumb and forefinger together.<br>'The weakness of your argument, my dear friend,' he said, beaming<br>at his own irony, 'the weakness appears to be, that you are NOT<br>thieves.'<br><br>'Now, my dear doctor--'<br><br>Flory sat up in the long chair, partly because his prickly heat<br>had just stabbed him in the back like a thousand needles, partly<br>because his favourite argument with the doctor was about to begin.<br>This argument, vaguely political in nature, took place as often as<br>the two men met. It was a topsy-turvy affair, for the Englishman<br>was bitterly anti-English and the Indian fanatically loyal. Dr<br>Veraswami had a passionate admiration for the English, which a<br>thousand snubs from Englishmen had not shaken. He would maintain<br>with positive eagerness that he, as an Indian, belonged to an<br>inferior and degenerate race. His faith in British justice was so<br>great that even when, at the jail, he had to superintend a flogging<br>or a hanging, and would come home with his black face faded grey<br>and dose himself with whisky, his zeal did not falter. Flory's<br>seditious opinions shocked him, but they also gave him a certain<br>shuddering pleasure, such as a pious believer will take in hearing<br>the Lord's Prayer repeated backwards.<br><br>'My dear doctor,' said Flory, 'how can you make out that we are in<br>this country for any purpose except to steal? It's so simple. The<br>official holds the Burman down while the businessman goes through<br>his pockets. Do you suppose my firm, for instance, could get its<br>timber contracts if the country weren't in the hands of the<br>British? Or the other timber firms, or the oil companies, or the<br>miners and planters and traders? How could the Rice Ring go on<br>skinning the unfortunate peasant if it hadn't the Government behind<br>it? The British Empire is simply a device for giving trade<br>monopolies to the English--or rather to gangs of Jews and<br>Scotchmen.'<br><br>'My friend, it iss pathetic to me to hear you talk so. It iss<br>truly pathetic. You say you are here to trade? Of course you are.<br>Could the Burmese trade for themselves? Can they make machinery,<br>ships, railways, roads? They are helpless without you. What would<br>happen to the Burmese forests if the English were not here? They<br>would be sold immediately to the Japanese, who would gut them and<br>ruin them. Instead of which, in your hands, actually they are<br>improved. And while your businessmen develop the resources of our<br>country, your officials are civilizing us, elevating us to their<br>level, from pure public spirit. It is a magnificent record of<br>self-sacrifice.'<br><br>'Bosh, my dear doctor. We teach the young men to drink whisky and<br>play football, I admit, but precious little else. Look at our<br>schools--factories for cheap clerks. We've never taught a single<br>useful manual trade to the Indians. We daren't; frightened of the<br>competition in industry. We've even crushed various industries.<br>Where are the Indian muslins now? Back in the forties or<br>thereabouts they were building sea-going ships in India, and<br>manning them as well. Now you couldn't build a seaworthy fishing<br>boat there. In the eighteenth century the Indians cast guns that<br>were at any rate up to the European standard. Now, after we've<br>been in India a hundred and fifty years, you can't make so much as<br>a brass cartridge-case in the whole continent. The only Eastern<br>races that have developed at all quickly are the independent ones.<br>I won't instance Japan, but take the case of Siam--'<br><br>The doctor waved his hand excitedly. He always interrupted the<br>argument at this point (for as a rule it followed the same course,<br>almost word for word), finding that the case of Siam hampered him.<br><br>'My friend, my friend, you are forgetting the Oriental character.<br>How iss it possible to have developed us, with our apathy and<br>superstition? At least you have brought to us law and order.<br>The unswerving British Justice and the Pax Britannica.'<br><br>'Pox Britannica, doctor, Pox Britannica is its proper name. And in<br>any case, whom is it pax for? The money-lender and the lawyer. Of<br>course we keep the peace in India, in our own interest, but what<br>does all this law and order business boil down to? More banks and<br>more prisons--that's all it means.'<br><br>'What monstrous misrepresentations!' cried the doctor. 'Are not<br>prissons necessary? And have you brought us nothing but prissons?<br>Consider Burma in the days of Thibaw, with dirt and torture and<br>ignorance, and then look around you. Look merely out of this<br>veranda--look at that hospital, and over to the right at that<br>school and that police station. Look at the whole uprush of modern<br>progress!'<br><br>'Of course I don't deny,' Flory said, 'that we modernize this<br>country in certain ways. We can't help doing so. In fact, before<br>we've finished we'll have wrecked the whole Burmese national<br>culture. But we're not civilizing them, we're only rubbing our<br>dirt on to them. Where's it going to lead, this uprush of modern<br>progress, as you call it? Just to our own dear old swinery of<br>gramophones and billycock hats. Sometimes I think that in two<br>hundred years all this--' he waved a foot towards the horizon--'all<br>this will be gone--forests, villages, monasteries, pagodas all<br>vanished. And instead, pink villas fifty yards apart; all over<br>those hills, as far as you can see, villa after villa, with all the<br>gramophones playing the same tune. And all the forests shaved<br>flat--chewed into wood-pulp for the News of the World, or sawn up<br>into gramophone cases. But the trees avenge themselves, as the old<br>chap says in The Wild Duck. You've read Ibsen, of course?'<br><br>'Ah, no, Mr Flory, alas! That mighty master-mind, your inspired<br>Bernard Shaw hass called him. It iss a pleasure to come. But, my<br>friend, what you do not see iss that your civilization at its very<br>worst iss for us an advance. Gramophones, billycock hats, the News<br>of the World--all iss better than the horrible sloth of the<br>Oriental. I see the British, even the least inspired of them,<br>ass--ass--' the doctor searched for a phrase, and found one that<br>probably came from Stevenson--'ass torchbearers upon the path of<br>progress.'<br><br>'I don't. I see them as a kind of up-to-date, hygienic, self-<br>satisfied louse. Creeping round the world building prisons. They<br>build a prison and call it progress,' he added rather regretfully--<br>for the doctor would not recognize the allusion.<br><br>'My friend, positively you are harping upon the subject of<br>prissons! Consider that there are also other achievements of your<br>countrymen. They construct roads, they irrigate deserts, they<br>conquer famines, they build schools, they set up hospitals, they<br>combat plague, cholera, leprosy, smallpox, venereal disease--'<br><br>'Having brought it themselves,' put in Flory.<br><br>'No, sir!' returned the doctor, eager to claim this distinction for<br>his own countrymen. 'No, sir, it wass the Indians who introduced<br>venereal disease into this country. The Indians introduce<br>diseases, and the English cure them. THERE iss the answer to all<br>your pessimism and seditiousness.'<br><br>'Well, doctor, we shall never agree. The fact is that you like all<br>this modern progress business, whereas I'd rather see things a<br>little bit septic. Burma in the days of Thibaw would have suited<br>me better, I think. And as I said before, if we are a civilizing<br>influence, it's only to grab on a larger scale. We should chuck it<br>quickly enough if it didn't pay.'<br><br>'My friend, you do not think that. If truly you disapprove of the<br>British Empire, you would not be talking of it privately here. You<br>would be proclaiming from the house-tops. I know your character,<br>Mr Flory, better than you know it yourself.'<br><br>'Sorry, doctor; I don't go in for proclaiming from the housetops.<br>I haven't the guts. I "counsel ignoble ease", like old Belial in<br>Paradise Lost. It's safer. You've got to be a pukka sahib or die,<br>in this country. In fifteen years I've never talked honestly to<br>anyone except you. My talks here are a safety-valve; a little<br>Black Mass on the sly, if you understand me.'<br><br>At this moment there was a desolate wailing noise outside. Old<br>Mattu, the Hindu durwan who looked after the European church, was<br>standing in the sunlight below the veranda. He was an old fever-<br>stricken creature, more like a grasshopper than a human being, and<br>dressed in a few square inches of dingy rag. He lived near the<br>church in a hut made of flattened kerosene tins, from which he<br>would sometimes hurry forth at the appearance of a European, to<br>salaam deeply and wail something about his 'talab', which was<br>eighteen rupees a month. Looking piteously up at the veranda, he<br>massaged the earth-coloured skin of his belly with one hand, and<br>with the other made the motion of putting food into his mouth. The<br>doctor felt in his pocket and dropped a four-anna piece over the<br>veranda rail. He was notorious for his soft-heartedness, and all<br>the beggars in Kyauktada made him their target.<br><br>'Behold there the degeneracy of the East,' said the doctor,<br>pointing to Mattu, who was doubling himself up like a caterpillar<br>and uttering grateful whines. 'Look at the wretchedness of hiss<br>limbs. The calves of hiss legs are not so thick ass an<br>Englishman's wrists. Look at hiss abjectness and servility. Look<br>at hiss ignorance--such ignorance ass iss not known in Europe<br>outside a home for mental defectives. Once I asked Mattu to tell<br>me hiss age. "Sahib," he said, "I believe that I am ten years<br>old." How can you pretend, Mr Flory, that you are not the natural<br>superior of such creatures?'<br><br>'Poor old Mattu, the uprush of modern progress seems to have missed<br>him somehow,' Flory said, throwing another four-anna piece over the<br>rail. 'Go on, Mattu, spend that on booze. Be as degenerate as you<br>can. It all postpones Utopia.'<br><br>'Aha, Mr Flory, sometimes I think that all you say iss but to--what<br>iss the expression?--pull my leg. The English sense of humour. We<br>Orientals have no humour, ass iss well known.'<br><br>'Lucky devils. It's been the ruin of us, our bloody sense of<br>humour.' He yawned with his hands behind his head. Mattu had<br>shambled away after further grateful noises. 'I suppose I ought to<br>be going before this cursed sun gets too high. The heat's going to<br>be devilish this year, I feel it in my bones. Well, doctor, we've<br>been arguing so much that I haven't asked for your news. I only<br>got in from the jungle yesterday. I ought to go back the day after<br>tomorrow--don't know whether I shall. Has anything been happening<br>in Kyauktada? Any scandals?'<br><br>The doctor looked suddenly serious. He had taken off his spectacles,<br>and his face, with dark liquid eyes, recalled that of a black<br>retriever dog. He looked away, and spoke in a slightly more<br>hesitant tone than before.<br><br>'That fact iss, my friend, there iss a most unpleasant business<br>afoot. You will perhaps laugh--it sounds nothing--but I am in<br>serious trouble. Or rather, I am in danger of trouble. It iss an<br>underground business. You Europeans will never hear of it<br>directly. In this place'--he waved a hand towards the bazaar--<br>'there iss perpetual conspiracies and plottings of which you do not<br>hear. But to us they mean much.'<br><br>'What's been happening, then?'<br><br>'It iss this. An intrigue iss brewing against me. A most serious<br>intrigue which iss intended to blacken my character and ruin my<br>official career. Ass an Englishman you will not understand these<br>things. I have incurred the enmity of a man you probably do not<br>know, U Po Kyin, the Sub-divisional Magistrate. He iss a most<br>dangerous man. The damage that he can do to me iss incalculable.'<br><br>'U Po Kyin? Which one is that?'<br><br>'The great fat man with many teeth. Hiss house iss down the road<br>there, a hundred yards away.'<br><br>'Oh, that fat scoundrel? I know him well.'<br><br>'No, no, my friend, no, no!' exclaimed the doctor quite eagerly;<br>'it cannot be that you know him. Only an Oriental could know him.<br>You, an English gentleman, cannot sink your mind to the depth of<br>such ass U Po Kyin. He iss more than a scoundrel, he iss--what<br>shall I say? Words fail me. He recalls to me a crocodile in human<br>shape. He hass the cunning of the crocodile, its cruelty, its<br>bestiality. If you knew the record of that man! The outrages he<br>hass committed! The extortions, the briberies! The girls he hass<br>ruined, raping them before the very eyes of their mothers! Ah, an<br>English gentleman cannot imagine such a character. And thiss iss<br>the man who hass taken hiss oath to ruin me.'<br><br>'I've heard a good deal about U Po Kyin from various sources,'<br>Flory said. 'He seems a fair sample of a Burmese magistrate.<br>A Burman told me that during the war U Po Kyin was at work<br>recruiting, and he raised a battalion from his own illegitimate<br>sons. Is that true?'<br><br>'It could hardly be so,' said the doctor, 'for they would not have<br>been old enough. But of hiss villainy there iss no doubt. And now<br>he iss determined upon ruining me. In the first place he hates me<br>because I know too much about him; and besides, he iss the enemy of<br>any reasonably honest man. He will proceed--such iss the practice<br>of such men--by calumny. He will spread reports about me--reports<br>of the most appalling and untrue descriptions. Already he iss<br>beginning them.'<br><br>'But would anyone believe a fellow like that against you? He's<br>only a lowdown magistrate. You're a high official.'<br><br>'Ah, Mr Flory, you do not understand Oriental cunning. U Po Kyin<br>hass ruined higher officials than I. He will know ways to make<br>himself believed. And therefore--ah, it iss a difficult business!'<br><br>The doctor took a step or two up and down the veranda, polishing<br>his glasses with his handkerchief. It was clear that there was<br>something more which delicacy prevented him from saying. For a<br>moment his manner was so troubled that Flory would have liked to<br>ask whether he could not help in some way, but he did not, for he<br>knew the uselessness of interfering in Oriental quarrels. No<br>European ever gets to the bottom of these quarrels; there is always<br>something impervious to the European mind, a conspiracy behind the<br>conspiracy, a plot within the plot. Besides, to keep out of<br>'native' quarrels is one of the Ten Precepts of the pukka sahib.<br>He said doubtfully:<br><br>'What is a difficult business?'<br><br>'It iss, if only--ah, my friend, you will laugh at me, I fear. But<br>it iss this: if only I were a member of your European Club! If<br>only! How different would my position be!'<br><br>'The Club? Why? How would that help you?'<br><br>'My friend, in these matters prestige iss everything. It iss not<br>that U Po Kyin will attack me openly; he would never dare; it iss<br>that he will libel me and backbite me. And whether he iss believed<br>or not depends entirely upon my standing with the Europeans. It<br>iss so that things happen in India. If our prestige iss good, we<br>rise; if bad, we fall. A nod and a wink will accomplish more than<br>a thousand official reports. And you do not know what prestige it<br>gives to an Indian to be a member of the European Club. In the<br>Club, practically he ISS a European. No calumny can touch him.<br>A Club member iss sacrosanct.'<br><br>Flory looked away over the veranda rail. He had got up as though<br>to go. It always made him ashamed and uncomfortable when it had to<br>be admitted between them that the doctor, because of his black<br>skin, could not be received in the Club. It is a disagreeable<br>thing when one's close friend is not one's social equal; but it is<br>a thing native to the very air of India.<br><br>'They might elect you at the next general meeting,' he said. 'I<br>don't say they will, but it's not impossible.'<br><br>'I trust, Mr Flory, that you do not think I am asking you to<br>propose me for the Club? Heaven forbid! I know that that iss<br>impossible for you. Simply I wass remarking that if I were a<br>member of the Club, I should be forthwith invulnerable--'<br><br>Flory cocked his Terai hat loosely on his head and stirred Flo up<br>with his stick. She was asleep under the chair. Flory felt very<br>uncomfortable. He knew that in all probability, if he had the<br>courage to face a few rows with Ellis, he could secure Dr<br>Veraswami's election to the Club. And the doctor, after all, was<br>his friend, indeed, almost the sole friend he had in Burma. They<br>had talked and argued together a hundred times, the doctor had<br>dined at his house, he had even proposed to introduce Flory to his<br>wife--but she, a pious Hindu, had refused with horror. They had<br>made shooting trips together--the doctor, equipped with bandoliers<br>and hunting knives, panting up hillsides slippery with bamboo<br>leaves and blazing his gun at nothing. In common decency it was<br>his duty to support the doctor. But he knew also that the doctor<br>would never ask for any support, and that there would be an ugly<br>row before an Oriental was got into the Club. No, he could not<br>face that row! It was not worth it. He said:<br><br>'To tell you the truth, there's been talk about this already. They<br>were discussing it this morning, and that little beast Ellis was<br>preaching his usual "dirty nigger" sermon. Macgregor has suggested<br>electing one native member. He's had orders to do so, I imagine.'<br><br>'Yes, I heard that. We hear all these things. It wass that that<br>put the idea into my head.'<br><br>'It's to come up at the general meeting in June. I don't know<br>what'll happen--it depends on Macgregor, I think. I'll give you my<br>vote, but I can't do more than that. I'm sorry, but I simply<br>can't. You don't know the row there'll be. Very likely they will<br>elect you, but they'll do it as an unpleasant duty, under protest.<br>They've made a perfect fetish of keeping this Club all-white, as<br>they call it.'<br><br>'Of course, of course, my friend! I understand perfectly. Heaven<br>forbid that you should get into trouble with your European friends<br>on my behalf. Please, please, never to embroil yourself! The mere<br>fact that you are known to be my friend benefits me more than you<br>can imagine. Prestige, Mr Flory, iss like a barometer. Every time<br>you are seen to enter my house the mercury rises half a degree.'<br><br>'Well, we must try and keep it at "Set Fair". That's about all I<br>can do for you, I'm afraid.'<br><br>'Even that iss much, my friend. And for that, there iss another<br>thing of which I would warn you, though you will laugh, I fear. It<br>iss that you yourself should beware of U Po Kyin. Beware of the<br>crocodile! For sure he will strike at you when he knows that you<br>are befriending me.'<br><br>'All right, doctor, I'll beware of the crocodile. I don't fancy he<br>can do me much harm, though.'<br><br>'At least he will try. I know him. It will be hiss policy to<br>detach my friends from me. Possibly he would even dare to spread<br>hiss libels about you also.'<br><br>'About me? Good gracious, no one would believe anything against<br>ME. Civis Romanus sum. I'm an Englishman--quite above suspicion.'<br><br>'Nevertheless, beware of hiss calumnies, my friend. Do not<br>underrate him. He will know how to strike at you. He iss a<br>crocodile. And like the crocodile'--the doctor nipped his thumb<br>and finger impressively; his images became mixed sometimes--'like<br>the crocodile, he strikes always at the weakest spot!'<br><br>'Do crocodiles always strike at the weakest spot, doctor?'<br><br>Both men laughed. They were intimate enough to laugh over the<br>doctor's queer English occasionally. Perhaps, at the bottom of his<br>heart, the doctor was a little disappointed that Flory had not<br>promised to propose him for the Club, but he would have perished<br>rather than say so. And Flory was glad to drop the subject, an<br>uncomfortable one which he wished had never been raised.<br><br>'Well, I really must be going, doctor. Good-bye in case I don't<br>see you again. I hope it'll be all right at the general meeting.<br>Macgregor's not a bad old stick. I dare say he'll insist on their<br>electing you.'<br><br>'Let us hope so, my friend. With that I can defy a hundred U Po<br>Kyins. A thousand! Good-bye, my friend, good-bye.'<br><br>Then Flory settled his Terai hat on his head and went home across<br>the glaring maidan, to his breakfast, for which the long morning of<br>drinking, smoking and talking had left him no appetite. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/1.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/3.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
