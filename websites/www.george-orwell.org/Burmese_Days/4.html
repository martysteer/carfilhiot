<h2>Chapter 5</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">In spite of the whisky he had drunk at the Club, Flory had little<br>sleep that night. The pariah curs were baying the moon--it was<br>only a quarter full and nearly down by midnight, but the dogs slept<br>all day in the heat, and they had begun their moon-choruses<br>already. One dog had taken a dislike to Flory's house, and had<br>settled down to bay at it systematically. Sitting on its bottom<br>fifty yards from the gate, it let out sharp, angry yelps, one to<br>half a minute, as regularly as a clock. It would keep this up for<br>two or three hours, until the cocks began crowing.<br><br>Flory lay turning from side to side, his head aching. Some fool<br>has said that one cannot hate an animal; he should try a few nights<br>in India, when the dogs are baying the moon. In the end Flory<br>could stand it no longer. He got up, rummaged in the tin uniform<br>case under his bed for a rifle and a couple of cartridges, and went<br>out on to the veranda.<br><br>It was fairly light in the quarter moon. He could see the dog, and<br>he could see his foresight. He rested himself against the wooden<br>pillar of the veranda and took aim carefully; then, as he felt the<br>hard vulcanite butt against his bare shoulder, he flinched. The<br>rifle had a heavy kick, and it left a bruise when one fired it.<br>The soft flesh of his shoulder quailed. He lowered the rifle.<br>He had not the nerve to fire it in cold blood.<br><br>It was no use trying to sleep. Flory got his jacket and some<br>cigarettes, and began to stroll up and down the garden path,<br>between the ghostly flowers. It was hot, and the mosquitoes found<br>him out and came droning after him. Phantoms of dogs were chasing<br>one another on the maidan. Over to the left the gravestones of the<br>English cemetery glittered whitish, rather sinister, and one could<br>see the mounds near by, that were the remains of old Chinese tombs.<br>The hillside was said to be haunted, and the Club chokras cried<br>when they were sent up the road at night.<br><br>'Cur, spineless cur,' Flory was thinking to himself; without heat,<br>however, for he was too accustomed to the thought. 'Sneaking,<br>idling, boozing, fornicating, soul-examining, self-pitying cur.<br>All those fools at the Club, those dull louts to whom you are so<br>pleased to think yourself superior--they are all better than you,<br>every man of them. At least they are men in their oafish way. Not<br>cowards, not liars. Not half-dead and rotting. But you--'<br><br>He had reason to call himself names. There had been a nasty, dirty<br>affair at the Club that evening. Something quite ordinary, quite<br>according to precedent; but still dingy, cowardly, dishonouring.<br><br>When Flory had arrived at the Club only Ellis and Maxwell were<br>there. The Lackersteens had gone to the station with the loan of<br>Mr Macgregor's car, to meet their niece, who was to arrive by the<br>night train. The three men were playing three-handed bridge fairly<br>amicably when Westfield came in, his sandy face quite pink with<br>rage, bringing a copy of a Burmese paper called the Burmese<br>Patriot. There was a libellous article in it, attacking Mr<br>Macgregor. The rage of Ellis and Westfield was devilish. They<br>were so angry that Flory had the greatest difficulty in pretending<br>to be angry enough to satisfy them. Ellis spent five minutes in<br>cursing and then, by some extraordinary process, made up his mind<br>that Dr Veraswami was responsible for the article. And he had<br>thought of a counterstroke already. They would put a notice on the<br>board--a notice answering and contradicting the one Mr Macgregor<br>had posted the day before. Ellis wrote it out immediately, in his<br>tiny, clear handwriting:<br><br>'In view of the cowardly insult recently offered to our Deputy<br>commissioner, we the undersigned wish to give it as our opinion<br>that this is the worst possible moment to consider the election of<br>niggers to this Club,' etc ,etc.<br><br>Westfield demurred to 'niggers'. It was crossed out by a single<br>thin line and 'natives' substituted. The notice was signed<br>'R. Westfield, P. W. Ellis, C. W. Maxwell, J. Flory.'<br><br>Ellis was so pleased with his idea that quite half of his anger<br>evaporated. The notice would accomplish nothing in itself, but the<br>news of it would travel swiftly round the town, and would reach Dr<br>Veraswami tomorrow. In effect, the doctor would have been publicly<br>called a nigger by the European community. This delighted Ellis.<br>For the rest of the evening he could hardly keep his eyes from the<br>notice-board, and every few minutes he exclaimed in glee, 'That'll<br>give little fat-belly something to think about, eh? Teach the<br>little sod what we think of him. That's the way to put 'em in<br>their place, eh?' etc.<br><br>Meanwhile, Flory had signed a public insult to his friend. He had<br>done it for the same reason as he had done a thousand such things<br>in his life; because he lacked the small spark of courage that was<br>needed to refuse. For, of course, he could have refused if he had<br>chosen; and, equally of course, refusal would have meant a row with<br>Ellis and Westfield. And oh, how he loathed a row! The nagging,<br>the jeers! At the very thought of it he flinched; he could feel<br>his birthmark palpable on his cheek, and something happening in his<br>throat that made his voice go flat and guilty. Not that! It was<br>easier to insult his friend, knowing that his friend must hear of<br>it.<br><br>Flory had been fifteen years in Burma, and in Burma one learns not<br>to set oneself up against public opinion. But his trouble was<br>older than that. It had begun in his mother's womb, when chance<br>put the blue birthmark on his cheek. He thought of some of the<br>early effects of his birthmark. His first arrival at school, aged<br>nine; the stares and, after a few days, shouts of the other boys;<br>the nickname Blueface, which lasted until the school poet (now,<br>Flory remembered, a critic who wrote rather good articles in the<br>Nation) came out with the couplet:<br><br><br>New-tick Flory does look rum,<br>Got a face like a monkey's bum,<br><br><br>whereupon the nickname was changed to Monkey-bum. And the<br>subsequent years. On Saturday nights the older boys used to have<br>what they called a Spanish Inquisition. The favourite torture was<br>for someone to hold you in a very painful grip known only to a few<br>illuminati and called Special Togo, while someone else beat you<br>with a conker on a piece of string. But Flory had lived down<br>'Monkey-bum' in time. He was a liar, and a good footballer, the<br>two things absolutely necessary for success at school. In his last<br>term he and another boy held the school poet in Special Togo while<br>the captain of the eleven gave him six with a spiked running shoe<br>for being caught writing a sonnet. It was a formative period.<br><br>From that school he went to a cheap, third-rate public school. It<br>was a poor, spurious place. It aped the great public schools with<br>their traditions of High Anglicanism, cricket and Latin verses, and<br>it had a school song called 'The Scrum of Life' in which God<br>figured as the Great Referee. But it lacked the chief virtue of<br>the great public schools, their atmosphere of literary scholarship.<br>The boys learned as nearly as possible nothing. There was not<br>enough caning to make them swallow the dreary rubbish of the<br>curriculum, and the wretched, underpaid masters were not the kind<br>from whom one absorbs wisdom unawares. Flory left school a<br>barbarous young lout. And yet even then there were, and he knew<br>it, certain possibilities in him; possibilities that would lead to<br>trouble as likely as not. But, of course, he had suppressed them.<br>A boy does not start his career nicknamed Monkey-bum without<br>learning his lesson.<br><br>He was not quite twenty when he came to Burma. His parents, good<br>people and devoted to him, had found him a place in a timber firm.<br>They had had great difficulty in getting him the job, had paid a<br>premium they could not afford; later, he had rewarded them by<br>answering their letters with careless scrawls at intervals of<br>months. His first six months in Burma he had spent in Rangoon,<br>where he was supposed to be learning the office side of his<br>business. He had lived in a 'chummery' with four other youths who<br>devoted their entire energies to debauchery. And what debauchery!<br>They swilled whisky which they privately hated, they stood round<br>the piano bawling songs of insane filthiness and silliness, they<br>squandered rupees by the hundred on aged Jewish whores with the<br>faces of crocodiles. That too had been a formative period.<br><br>From Rangoon he had gone to a camp in the jungle, north of<br>Mandalay, extracting teak. The jungle life was not a bad one, in<br>spite of the discomfort, the loneliness, and what is almost the<br>worst thing in Burma, the filthy, monotonous food. He was very<br>young then, young enough for hero-worship, and he had friends among<br>the men in his firm. There were also shooting, fishing, and<br>perhaps once in a year a hurried trip to Rangoon--pretext, a visit<br>to the dentist. Oh, the joy of those Rangoon trips! The rush to<br>Smart and Mookerdum's bookshop for the new novels out from England,<br>the dinner at Anderson's with beefsteaks and butter that had<br>travelled eight thousand miles on ice, the glorious drinking-bout!<br>He was too young to realize what this life was preparing for him.<br>He did not see the years stretching out ahead, lonely, eventless,<br>corrupting.<br><br>He acclimatized himself to Burma. His body grew attuned to the<br>strange rhythms of the tropical seasons. Every year from February<br>to May the sun glared in the sky like an angry god, then suddenly<br>the monsoon blew westward, first in sharp squalls, then in a heavy<br>ceaseless downpour that drenched everything until neither one's<br>clothes, one's bed nor even one's food ever seemed to be dry. It<br>was still hot, with a stuffy, vaporous heat. The lower jungle<br>paths turned into morasses, and the paddy-fields were wastes of<br>stagnant water with a stale, mousy smell. Books and boots were<br>mildewed. Naked Burmans in yard-wide hats of palm-leaf ploughed<br>the paddy-fields, driving their buffaloes through knee-deep water.<br>Later, the women and children planted the green seedlings of paddy,<br>dabbing each plant into the mud with little three-pronged forks.<br>Through July and August there was hardly a pause in the rain. Then<br>one night, high overhead, one heard a squawking of invisible birds.<br>The snipe were flying southward from Central Asia. The rains<br>tailed off, ending in October. The fields dried up, the paddy<br>ripened, the Burmese children played hop-scotch with gonyin seeds<br>and flew kites in the cool winds. It was the beginning of the<br>short winter, when Upper Burma seemed haunted by the ghost of<br>England. Wild flowers sprang into bloom everywhere, not quite the<br>same as the English ones, but very like them--honeysuckle in thick<br>bushes, field roses smelling of pear-drops, even violets in dark<br>places of the forest. The sun circled low in the sky, and the<br>nights and early mornings were bitterly cold, with white mists that<br>poured through the valleys like the steam of enormous kettles. One<br>went shooting after duck and snipe. There were snipe in countless<br>myriads, and wild geese in flocks that rose from the jeel with a<br>roar like a goods train crossing an iron bridge. The ripening<br>paddy, breast-high and yellow, looked like wheat. The Burmans went<br>to their work with muffled heads and their arms clasped across<br>their breasts, their faces yellow and pinched with the cold. In<br>the morning one marched through misty, incongruous wilderness,<br>clearings of drenched, almost English grass and naked trees where<br>monkeys squatted in the upper branches, waiting for the sun. At<br>night, coming back to camp through the cold lanes, one met herds of<br>buffaloes which the boys were driving home, with their huge horns<br>looming through the mist like crescents. One had three blankets on<br>one's bed, and game pies instead of the eternal chicken. After<br>dinner one sat on a log by the vast camp-fire, drinking beer and<br>talking about shooting. The flames danced like red holly, casting<br>a circle of light at the edge of which servants and coolies<br>squatted, too shy to intrude on the white men and yet edging up to<br>the fire like dogs. As one lay in bed one could hear the dew<br>dripping from the trees like large but gentle rain. It was a good<br>life while one was young and need not think about the future or the<br>past.<br><br>Flory was twenty-four, and due for home leave, when the War broke<br>out. He had dodged military service, which was easy to do and<br>seemed natural at the time. The civilians in Burma had a<br>comforting theory that 'sticking by one's job' (wonderful language,<br>English! 'Sticking BY'--how different from 'sticking TO') was the<br>truest patriotism; there was even a covert hostility towards the<br>men who threw up their jobs in order to join the Army. In reality,<br>Flory had dodged the War because the East already corrupted him,<br>and he did not want to exchange his whisky, his servants and his<br>Burmese girls for the boredom of the parade ground and the strain<br>of cruel marches. The War rolled on, like a storm beyond the<br>horizon. The hot, blowsy country, remote from danger, had a<br>lonely, forgotten feeling. Flory took to reading voraciously, and<br>learned to live in books when life was tiresome. He was growing<br>adult, tiring of boyish pleasures, learning to think for himself,<br>almost willy-nilly.<br><br>He celebrated his twenty-seventh birthday in hospital, covered from<br>head to foot with hideous sores which were called mud-sores, but<br>were probably caused by whisky and bad food. They left little pits<br>in his skin which did not disappear for two years. Quite suddenly<br>he had begun to look and feel very much older. His youth was<br>finished. Eight years of Eastern life, fever, loneliness and<br>intermittent drinking, had set their mark on him.<br><br>Since then, each year had been lonelier and more bitter than the<br>last. What was at the centre of all his thoughts now, and what<br>poisoned everything, was the ever bitterer hatred of the atmosphere<br>of imperialism in which he lived. For as his brain developed--you<br>cannot stop your brain developing, and it is one of the tragedies<br>of the half-educated that they develop late, when they are already<br>committed to some wrong way of life--he had grasped the truth about<br>the English and their Empire. The Indian Empire is a despotism--<br>benevolent, no doubt, but still a despotism with theft as its final<br>object. And as to the English of the East, the sahiblog, Flory had<br>come so to hate them from living in their society, that he was<br>quite incapable of being fair to them. For after all, the poor<br>devils are no worse than anybody else. They lead unenviable lives;<br>it is a poor bargain to spend thirty years, ill-paid, in an alien<br>country, and then come home with a wrecked liver and a pine-apple<br>backside from sitting in cane chairs, to settle down as the bore of<br>some second-rate Club. On the other hand, the sahiblog are not to<br>be idealized. There is a prevalent idea that the men at the<br>'outposts of Empire' are at least able and hardworking. It is a<br>delusion. Outside the scientific services--the Forest Department,<br>the Public Works Department and the like--there is no particular<br>need for a British official in India to do his job competently.<br>Few of them work as hard or as intelligently as the postmaster of a<br>provincial town in England. The real work of administration is<br>done mainly by native subordinates; and the real backbone of the<br>despotism is not the officials but the Army. Given the Army, the<br>officials and the businessmen can rub along safely enough even if<br>they are fools. And most of them ARE fools. A dull, decent<br>people, cherishing and fortifying their dullness behind a quarter<br>of a million bayonets.<br><br>It is a stifling, stultifying world in which to live. It is a<br>world in which every word and every thought is censored. In<br>England it is hard even to imagine such an atmosphere. Everyone is<br>free in England; we sell our souls in public and buy them back in<br>private, among our friends. But even friendship can hardly exist<br>when every white man is a cog in the wheels of despotism. Free<br>speech is unthinkable. All other kinds of freedom are permitted.<br>You are free to be a drunkard, an idler, a coward, a backbiter, a<br>fornicator; but you are not free to think for yourself. Your<br>opinion on every subject of any conceivable importance is dictated<br>for you by the pukka sahibs' code.<br><br>In the end the secrecy of your revolt poisons you like a secret<br>disease. Your whole life is a life of lies. Year after year you<br>sit in Kipling-haunted little Clubs, whisky to right of you,<br>Pink'un to left of you, listening and eagerly agreeing while<br>Colonel Bodger develops his theory that these bloody Nationalists<br>should be boiled in oil. You hear your Oriental friends called<br>'greasy little babus', and you admit, dutifully, that they ARE<br>greasy little babus. You see louts fresh from school kicking grey-<br>haired servants. The time comes when you burn with hatred of your<br>own countrymen, when you long for a native rising to drown their<br>Empire in blood. And in this there is nothing honourable, hardly<br>even any sincerity. For, au fond, what do you care if the Indian<br>Empire is a despotism, if Indians are bullied and exploited? You<br>only care because the right of free speech is denied you. You are<br>a creature of the despotism, a pukka sahib, tied tighter than a<br>monk or a savage by an unbreakable system of tabus.<br><br>Time passed and each year Flory found himself less at home in the<br>world of the sahibs, more liable to get into trouble when he talked<br>seriously on any subject whatever. So he had learned to live<br>inwardly, secretly, in books and secret thoughts that could not be<br>uttered. Even his talks with the doctor were a kind of talking to<br>himself; for the doctor, good man, understood little of what was<br>said to him. But it is a corrupting thing to live one's real life<br>in secret. One should live with the stream of life, not against<br>it. It would be better to be the thickest-skulled pukka sahib who<br>ever hiccuped over 'Forty years on', than to live silent, alone,<br>consoling oneself in secret, sterile worlds.<br><br>Flory had never been home to England. Why, he could not have<br>explained, though he knew well enough. In the beginning accidents<br>had prevented him. First there was the War, and after the War his<br>firm were so short of trained assistants that they would not let<br>him go for two years more. Then at last he had set out. He was<br>pining for England, though he dreaded facing it, as one dreads<br>facing a pretty girl when one is collarless and unshaven. When he<br>left home he had been a boy, a promising boy and handsome in spite<br>of his birthmark; now, only ten years later, he was yellow, thin,<br>drunken, almost middle-aged in habits and appearance. Still, he<br>was pining for England. The ship rolled westward over wastes of<br>sea like rough-beaten silver, with the winter trade wind behind<br>her. Flory's thin blood quickened with the good food and the smell<br>of the sea. And it occurred to him--a thing he had actually<br>forgotten in the stagnant air of Burma--that he was still young<br>enough to begin over again. He would live a year in a civilized<br>society, he would find some girl who did not mind his birthmark--<br>a civilized girl, not a pukka memsahib--and he would marry her and<br>endure ten, fifteen more years of Burma. Then they would retire--<br>he would be worth twelve or fifteen thousand pounds on retirement,<br>perhaps. They would buy a cottage in the country, surround<br>themselves with friends, books, their children, animals. They<br>would be free for ever of the smell of pukka sahibdom. He would<br>forget Burma, the horrible country that had come near ruining him.<br><br>When he reached Colombo he found a cable waiting for him. Three<br>men in his firm had died suddenly of black-water fever. The firm<br>were sorry, but would he please return to Rangoon at once? He<br>should have his leave at the earliest possible opportunity.<br><br>Flory boarded the next boat for Rangoon, cursing his luck, and took<br>the train back to his headquarters. He was not at Kyauktada then,<br>but at another Upper Burma town. All the servants were waiting for<br>him on the platform. He had handed them over en bloc to his<br>successor, who had died. It was so queer to see their familiar<br>faces again! Only ten days ago he had been speeding for England,<br>almost thinking himself in England already; and now back in the old<br>stale scene, with the naked black coolies squabbling over the<br>luggage and a Burman shouting at his bullocks down the road.<br><br>The servants came crowding round him, a ring of kindly brown faces,<br>offering presents. Ko S'la had brought a sambhur skin, the Indians<br>some sweetmeats and a garland of marigolds, Ba Pe, a young boy<br>then, a squirrel in a wicker cage. There were bullock carts<br>waiting for the luggage. Flory walked up to the house, looking<br>ridiculous with the big garland dangling from his neck. The light<br>of the cold-weather evening was yellow and kind. At the gate an<br>old Indian, the colour of earth, was cropping grass with a tiny<br>sickle. The wives of the cook and the mali were kneeling in front<br>of the servants' quarters, grinding curry paste on the stone slab.<br><br>Something turned over in Flory's heart. It was one of those moments<br>when one becomes conscious of a vast change and deterioration in<br>one's life. For he had realized, suddenly, that in his heart he was<br>glad to be coming back. This country which he hated was now his<br>native country, his home. He had lived here ten years, and every<br>particle of his body was compounded of Burmese soil. Scenes like<br>these--the sallow evening light, the old Indian cropping grass, the<br>creak of the cartwheels, the streaming egrets--were more native to<br>him than England. He had sent deep roots, perhaps his deepest, into<br>a foreign country.<br><br>Since then he had not even applied for home leave. His father had<br>died, then his mother, and his sisters, disagreeable horse-faced<br>women whom he had never liked, had married and he had almost lost<br>touch with them. He had no tie with Europe now, except the tie of<br>books. For he had realized that merely to go back to England was<br>no remedy for loneliness; he had grasped the special nature of the<br>hell that is reserved for Anglo-Indians. Ah, those poor prosing<br>old wrecks in Bath and Cheltenham! Those tomb-like boarding-houses<br>with Anglo-Indians littered about in all stages of decomposition,<br>all talking and talking about what happened in Boggleywalah in '88!<br>Poor devils, they know what it means to have left one's heart in an<br>alien and hated country. There was, he saw clearly, only one way<br>out. To find someone who would share his life in Burma--but really<br>share it, share his inner, secret life, carry away from Burma the<br>same memories as he carried. Someone who would love Burma as he<br>loved it and hate it as he hated it. Who would help him to live<br>with nothing hidden, nothing unexpressed. Someone who understood<br>him: a friend, that was what it came down to.<br><br>A friend. Or a wife? That quite impossible she. Someone like Mrs<br>Lackersteen, for instance? Some damned memsahib, yellow and thin,<br>scandalmongering over cocktails, making kit-kit with the servants,<br>living twenty years in the country without learning a word of the<br>language. Not one of those, please God.<br><br>Flory leaned over the gate. The moon was vanishing behind the dark<br>wall of the jungle, but the dogs were still howling. Some lines<br>from Gilbert came into his mind, a vulgar silly jingle but<br>appropriate--something about 'discoursing on your complicated state<br>of mind'. Gilbert was a gifted little skunk. Did all his trouble,<br>then, simply boil down to that? Just complicated, unmanly<br>whinings; poor-little-rich-girl stuff? Was he no more than a<br>loafer using his idleness to invent imaginary woes? A spiritual<br>Mrs Wititterly? A Hamlet without poetry? Perhaps. And if so, did<br>that make it any more bearable? It is not the less bitter because<br>it is perhaps one's own fault, to see oneself drifting, rotting, in<br>dishonour and horrible futility, and all the while knowing that<br>somewhere within one there is the possibility of a decent human<br>being.<br><br>Oh well, God save us from self-pity! Flory went back to the<br>veranda, took up the rifle, and wincing slightly, let drive at the<br>pariah dog. There was an echoing roar, and the bullet buried<br>itself in the maidan, wide of the mark. A mulberry-coloured bruise<br>sprang out on Flory's shoulder. The dog gave a yell of fright,<br>took to its heels, and then, sitting down fifty yards farther away,<br>once more began rhythmically baying. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/3.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/5.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
