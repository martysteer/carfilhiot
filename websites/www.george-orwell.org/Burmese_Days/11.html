<h2>Chapter 12</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">In the sticky, sleepy heat of the living-room, almost dark because<br>of the beaded curtain, U Po Kyin was marching slowly up and down,<br>boasting. From time to time he would put a hand under his singlet<br>and scratch his sweating breasts, huge as a woman's with fat. Ma<br>Kin was sitting on her mat, smoking slender white cigars. Through<br>the open door of the bedroom one could see the corner of U Po<br>Kyin's huge square bed, with carved teak posts, like a catafalque,<br>on which he had committed many and many a rape.<br><br>Ma Kin was now hearing for the first time of the 'other affair'<br>which underlay U Po Kyin's attack on Dr Veraswami. Much as he<br>despised her intelligence, U Po Kyin usually let Ma Kin into his<br>secrets sooner or later. She was the only person in his immediate<br>circle who was not afraid of him, and there was therefore a<br>pleasure in impressing her.<br><br>'Well, Kin Kin,' he said, 'you see how it has all gone according to<br>plan! Eighteen anonymous letters already, and every one of them a<br>masterpiece. I would repeat some of them to you if I thought you<br>were capable of appreciating them.'<br><br>'But supposing the Europeans take no notice of your anonymous<br>letters? What then?'<br><br>'Take no notice? Aha, no fear of that! I think I know something<br>about the European mentality. Let me tell you, Kin Kin, that if<br>there is one thing I CAN do, it is to write an anonymous letter.'<br><br>This was true. U Po Kyin's letters had already taken effect, and<br>especially on their chief target, Mr Macgregor.<br><br>Only two days earlier than this, Mr Macgregor had spent a very<br>troubled evening in trying to make up his mind whether Dr Veraswami<br>was or was not guilty of disloyalty to the Government. Of course,<br>it was not a question of any overt act of disloyalty--that was<br>quite irrelevant. The point was, was the doctor the KIND of man<br>who would hold seditious opinions? In India you are not judged for<br>what you do, but for what you ARE. The merest breath of suspicion<br>against his loyalty can ruin an Oriental official. Mr Macgregor<br>had too just a nature to condemn even an Oriental out of hand. He<br>had puzzled as late as midnight over a whole pile of confidential<br>papers, including the five anonymous letters he had received,<br>besides two others that had been forwarded to him by Westfield,<br>pinned together with a cactus thorn.<br><br>It was not only the letters. Rumours about the doctor had been<br>pouring in from every side. U Po Kyin fully grasped that to call<br>the doctor a traitor was not enough in itself; it was necessary to<br>attack his reputation from every possible angle. The doctor was<br>charged not only with sedition, but also with extortion, rape,<br>torture, performing illegal operations, performing operations while<br>blind drunk, murder by poison, murder by sympathetic magic, eating<br>beef, selling death certificates to murderers, wearing his shoes in<br>the precincts of the pagoda and making homosexual attempts on the<br>Military Police drummer boy. To hear what was said of him, anyone<br>would have imagined the doctor a compound of Machiavelli, Sweeny<br>Todd and the Marquis de Sade. Mr Macgregor had not paid much<br>attention at first. He was too accustomed to this kind of thing.<br>But with the last of the anonymous letters U Po Kyin had brought<br>off a stroke that was brilliant even for him.<br><br>It concerned the escape of Nga Shwe O, the dacoit, from Kyauktada<br>jail. Nga Shwe O, who was in the middle of a well-earned seven<br>years, had been preparing his escape for several months past, and<br>as a start his friends outside had bribed one of the Indian<br>warders. The warder received his hundred rupees in advance,<br>applied for leave to visit the death-bed of a relative and spent<br>several busy days in the Mandalay brothels. Time passed, and the<br>day of the escape was postponed several times--the warder,<br>meanwhile, growing more and more homesick for the brothels.<br>Finally he decided to earn a further reward by betraying the plot<br>to U Po Kyin. But U Po Kyin, as usual, saw his chance. He told<br>the warder on dire penalties to hold his tongue, and then, on the<br>very night of the escape, when it was too late to do anything, sent<br>another anonymous letter to Mr Macgregor, warning him that an<br>escape was being attempted. The letter added, needless to say,<br>that Dr Veraswami, the superintendent of the jail, had been bribed<br>for his connivance.<br><br>In the morning there was a hullabaloo and a rushing to and fro of<br>warders and, policemen at the jail, for Nga Shwe O had escaped.<br>(He was a long way down the river, in a sampan provided by U Po<br>Kyin.) This time Mr Macgregor was taken aback. Whoever had<br>written the letter must have been privy to the plot, and was<br>probably telling the truth about the doctor's connivance. It was a<br>very serious matter. A jail superintendent who will take bribes to<br>let a prisoner escape is capable of anything. And therefore--<br>perhaps the logical sequence was not quite clear, but it was clear<br>enough to Mr Macgregor--therefore the charge of sedition, which was<br>the main charge against the doctor, became much more credible.<br><br>U Po Kyin had attacked the other Europeans at the same time.<br>Flory, who was the doctor's friend and his chief source of<br>prestige, had been scared easily enough into deserting him. With<br>Westfield it was a little harder. Westfield, as a policeman, knew<br>a great deal about U Po Kyin and might conceivably upset his plans.<br>Policemen and magistrates are natural enemies. But U Po Kyin had<br>known how to turn even this fact to advantage. He had accused the<br>doctor, anonymously of course, of being in league with the<br>notorious scoundrel and bribe-taker U Po Kyin. That settled<br>Westfield. As for Ellis, no anonymous letters were needed in his<br>case; nothing could possibly make him think worse of the doctor<br>than he did already.<br><br>U Po Kyin had even sent one of his anonymous letters to Mrs<br>Lackersteen, for he knew the power of European women. Dr<br>Veraswami, the letter said, was inciting the natives to abduct and<br>rape the European women--no details were given, nor were they<br>needed. U Po Kyin had touched Mrs Lackersteen's weak spot. To her<br>mind the words 'sedition', 'Nationalism,', 'rebellion', 'Home<br>Rule', conveyed one thing and one only, and that was a picture of<br>herself being raped by a procession of jet-black coolies with<br>rolling white eyeballs. It was a thought that kept her awake at<br>night sometimes. Whatever good regard the Europeans might once<br>have had for the doctor was crumbling rapidly.<br><br>'So you see,' said U Po Kyin with a pleased air, 'you see how I<br>have undermined him. He is like a tree sawn through at the base.<br>One tap and down he comes. In three weeks or less I shall deliver<br>that tap.'<br><br>'How?'<br><br>'I am just coming to that. I think it is time for you to hear<br>about it. You have no sense in these matters, but you know how to<br>hold your tongue. You have heard talk of this rebellion that is<br>brewing near Thongwa village?'<br><br>'Yes. They are very foolish, those villagers. What can they do<br>with their dahs and spears against the Indian soldiers? They will<br>be shot down like wild animals.'<br><br>'Of course. If there is any fighting it will be a massacre. But<br>they are only a pack of superstitious peasants. They have put<br>their faith in these absurd bullet-proof jackets that are being<br>distributed to them. I despise such ignorance.'<br><br>'Poor men! Why do you not stop them, Ko Po Kyin? There is no need<br>to arrest anybody. You have only to go to the village and tell<br>them that you know their plans, and they will never dare to go on.'<br><br>'Ah well, I could stop them if I chose, of course. But then I do<br>not choose. I have my reasons. You see, Kin Kin--you will please<br>keep silent about this--this is, so to speak, my own rebellion. I<br>arranged it myself.'<br><br>'What!'<br><br>Ma Kin dropped her cigar. Her eyes had opened so wide that the<br>pale blue white showed all round the pupil. She was horrified.<br>She burst out:<br><br>'Ko Po Kyin, what are you saying? You do not mean it! You,<br>raising a rebellion--it cannot be true!'<br><br>'Certainly it is true. And a very good job we are making of it.<br>That magician whom I brought from Rangoon is a clever fellow. He<br>has toured all over India as a circus conjurer. The bullet-proof<br>jackets were bought at Whiteaway & Laidlaw's stores, one rupee<br>eight annas each. They are costing me a pretty penny, I can tell<br>you.'<br><br>'But, Ko Po Kyin! A rebellion! The terrible fighting and shooting,<br>and all the poor men who will be killed! Surely you have not<br>gone mad? Are you not afraid of being shot yourself?'<br><br>U Po Kyin halted in his stride. He was astonished. 'Good gracious,<br>woman, what idea have you got hold of now? You do not suppose that<br>_I_ am rebelling against the Government? I--a Government servant<br>of thirty years' standing! Good heavens, no! I said that I had<br>STARTED the rebellion, not that I was taking part in it. It is<br>these fools of villagers who are going to risk their skins, not I.<br>No one dreams that I have anything to do with it, or ever will,<br>except Ba Sein and one or two others.'<br><br>'But you said it was you who were persuading them to rebel?'<br><br>'Of course. I have accused Veraswami of raising a rebellion<br>against the Government. Well, I must have a rebellion to show,<br>must I not?'<br><br>'Ah, I see. And when the rebellion breaks out, you are going to<br>say that Dr Veraswami is to blame for it. Is that it?'<br><br>'How slow you are! I should have thought even a fool would have<br>seen that I am raising the rebellion merely in order to crush it.<br>I am--what is that expression Mr Macgregor uses? Agent provocateur--<br>Latin, you would not understand. I am agent provocateur. First I<br>persuade these fools at Thongwa to rebel, and then I arrest them as<br>rebels. At the very moment when it is due to start, I shall pounce<br>on the ringleaders and clap every one of them in jail. After that,<br>I dare say there may possibly be some fighting. A few men may be<br>killed and a few more sent to the Andamans. But, meanwhile, I shall<br>be first in the field. U Po Kyin, the man who quelled a most<br>dangerous rising in the nick of time! I shall be the hero of the<br>district.'<br><br>U Po Kyin, justly proud of his plan, began to pace up and down the<br>room again with his hands behind his back, smiling. Ma Kin<br>considered the plan in silence for some time. Finally she said:<br><br>'I still do not see why you are doing this, Ko Po Kyin. Where is<br>it all leading? And what has it got to do with Dr Veraswami?'<br><br>'I shall never teach you wisdom, Kin Kin! Did I not tell you at<br>the beginning that Veraswami stands in my way? This rebellion is<br>the very thing to get rid of him. Of course we shall never prove<br>that he is responsible for it; but what does that matter? All the<br>Europeans will take it for granted that he is mixed up in it<br>somehow. That is how their minds work. He will be ruined for<br>life. And his fall is my rise. The blacker I can paint him, the<br>more glorious my own conduct will appear. Now do you understand?'<br><br>'Yes, I do understand. And I think it is a base, evil plan. I<br>wonder you are not ashamed to tell it me.'<br><br>'Now, Kin Kin! Surely you are not going to start that nonsense<br>over again?'<br><br>'Ko Po Kyin, why is it that you are only happy when you are being<br>wicked? Why is it that everything you do must bring evil to<br>others? Think of that poor doctor who will be dismissed from his<br>post, and those villagers who will be shot or flogged with bamboos<br>or imprisoned for life. Is it necessary to do such things? What<br>can you want with more money when you are rich already?'<br><br>'Money! Who is talking about money? Some day, woman, you will<br>realize that there are other things in the world besides money.<br>Fame, for example. Greatness. Do you realize that the Governor of<br>Burma will very probably pin an Order on my breast for my loyal<br>action in this affair? Would not even you be proud of such an<br>honour as that?'<br><br>Ma Kin shook her head, unimpressed. 'When will you remember, Ko Po<br>Kyin, that you are not going to live a thousand years? Consider<br>what happens to those who have lived wickedly. There is such a<br>thing, for instance, as being turned into a rat or a frog. There<br>is even hell. I remember what a priest said to me once about hell,<br>something that he had translated from the Pali scriptures, and it<br>was very terrible. He said, "Once in a thousand centuries two red-<br>hot spears will meet in your heart, and you will say to yourself,<br>'Another thousand centuries of my torment are ended, and there is<br>as much to come as there has been before.'" Is it not very<br>dreadful to think of such things, Ko Po Kyin?'<br><br>U Po Kyin laughed and gave a careless wave of his hand that meant<br>'pagodas'.<br><br>'Well, I hope you may still laugh when it comes to the end. But<br>for myself, I should not care to look back upon such a life.'<br><br>She relighted her cigar with her thin shoulder turned disapprovingly<br>on U Po Kyin while he took several more turns up and down the room.<br>When he spoke, it was more seriously than before, and even with a<br>touch of diffidence.<br><br>'You know, Kin Kin, there is another matter behind all this.<br>Something that I have not told to you or to anyone else. Even Ba<br>Sein does not know. But I believe I will tell it you now.'<br><br>'I do not want to hear it, if it is more wickedness.'<br><br>'No, no. You were asking just now what is my real object in this<br>affair. You think, I suppose, that I am ruining Veraswami merely<br>because I dislike him and his ideas about bribes as a nuisance.<br>It is not only that. There is something else that is far more<br>important, and it concerns you as well as me.'<br><br>'What is it?'<br><br>'Have you never felt in you, Kin Kin, a desire for higher things?<br>Has it never struck you that after all our successes--all my<br>successes, I should say--we are almost in the same position as when<br>we started? I am worth, I dare say, two lakhs of rupees, and yet<br>look at the style in which we live! Look at this room! Positively<br>it is no better than that of a peasant. I am tired of eating with<br>my fingers and associating only with Burmans--poor, inferior<br>people--and living, as you might say, like a miserable Township<br>Officer. Money is not enough; I should like to feel that I have<br>risen in the world as well. Do you not wish sometimes for a way of<br>life that is a little more--how shall I say--elevated?'<br><br>'I do not know how we could want more than what we have already.<br>When I was a girl in my village I never thought that I should live<br>in such a house as this. Look at those English chairs--I have<br>never sat in one of them in my life. But I am very proud to look<br>at them and think that I own them.'<br><br>'Ch! Why did you ever leave that village of yours, Kin Kin? You<br>are only fit to stand gossiping by the well with a stone water-pot<br>on your head. But I am more ambitious, God be praised. And now I<br>will tell you the real reason why I am intriguing against Veraswami.<br>It is in my mind to do something that is really magnificent.<br>Something noble, glorious! Something that is the very highest<br>honour an Oriental can attain to. You know what I mean, of course?'<br><br>'No. What do you mean?'<br><br>'Come, now! The greatest achievement of my life! Surely you can<br>guess?'<br><br>'Ah, I know! You are going to buy a motor-car. But oh, Ko Po<br>Kyin, please do not expect me to ride in it!'<br><br>U Po Kyin threw up his hands in disgust. 'A motor-car! You have<br>the mind of a bazaar peanut-seller! I could buy twenty motor-cars<br>if I wanted them. And what use would a motor-car be in this place?<br>No, it is something far grander than that.'<br><br>'What, then?'<br><br>'It is this. I happen to know that in a month's time the Europeans<br>are going to elect one native member to their Club. They do not<br>want to do it, but they will have orders from the Commissioner, and<br>they will obey. Naturally, they would elect Veraswami, who is the<br>highest native official in the district. But I have disgraced<br>Veraswami. And so--'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>U Po Kyin did not answer for a moment. He looked at Ma Kin, and<br>his vast yellow face, with its broad jaw and numberless teeth, was<br>so softened that it was almost child-like. There might even have<br>been tears in his tawny eyes. He said in a small, almost awed<br>voice, as though the greatness of what he was saying overcame him:<br><br>'Do you not see, woman? Do you not see that if Veraswami is<br>disgraced I shall be elected to the Club myself?'<br><br>The effect of it was crushing. There was not another word of<br>argument on Ma Kin's part. The magnificence of U Po Kyin's project<br>had struck her dumb.<br><br>And not without reason, for all the achievements of U Po Kyin's<br>life were as nothing beside this. It is a real triumph--it would<br>be doubly so in Kyauktada--for an official of the lower ranks to<br>worm his way into the European Club. The European Club, that<br>remote, mysterious temple, that holy of holies far harder of entry<br>than Nirvana! Po Kyin, the naked gutter-boy of Mandalay, the<br>thieving clerk and obscure official, would enter that sacred place,<br>call Europeans 'old chap', drink whisky and soda and knock white<br>balls to and fro on the green table! Ma Kin, the village woman,<br>who had first seen the light through the chinks of a bamboo hut<br>thatched with palm-leaves, would sit on a high chair with her feet<br>imprisoned in silk stockings and high-heeled shoes (yes, she would<br>actually wear shoes in that place!) talking to English ladies in<br>Hindustani about baby-linen! It was a prospect that would have<br>dazzled anybody.<br><br>For a long time Ma Kin remained silent, her lips parted, thinking<br>of the European Club and the splendours that it might contain.<br>For the first time in her life she surveyed U Po Kyin's intrigues<br>without disapproval. Perhaps it was a feat greater even than the<br>storming of the Club to have planted a grain of ambition in Ma<br>Kin's gentle heart. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/10.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/12.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
