<h2>Chapter 16</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The vultures in the big pyinkado trees by the cemetery flapped from<br>their dung-whitened branches, steadied themselves on the wing, and<br>climbed by vast spirals into the upper air. It was early, but<br>Flory was out already. He was going down to the Club, to wait<br>until Elizabeth came and then ask her formally to marry him. Some<br>instinct, which he did not understand, prompted him to do it before<br>the other Europeans returned from the jungle.<br><br>As he came out of the compound gate he saw that there was a new<br>arrival at Kyauktada. A youth with a long spear like a needle in<br>his hand was cantering across the maidan on a white pony. Some<br>Sikhs, looking like sepoys, ran after him, leading two other<br>ponies, a bay and a chestnut, by the bridle. When he came level<br>with him Flory halted on the road and shouted good morning. He had<br>not recognized the youth, but it is usual in small stations to make<br>strangers welcome. The other saw that he was hailed, wheeled his<br>pony negligently round and brought it to the side of the road. He<br>was a youth of about twenty-live, lank but very straight, and<br>manifestly a cavalry officer. He had one of those rabbit-like<br>faces common among English soldiers, with pale blue eyes and a<br>little triangle of fore-teeth visible between the lips; yet hard,<br>fearless and even brutal in a careless fashion--a rabbit, perhaps,<br>but a tough and martial rabbit. He sat his horse as though he were<br>part of it, and he looked offensively young and fit. His fresh<br>face was tanned to the exact shade that went with his light-<br>coloured eyes, and he was as elegant as a picture with his white<br>buckskin topi and his polo-boots that gleamed like an old<br>meerschaum pipe. Flory felt uncomfortable in his presence from<br>the start.<br><br>'How d'you do?' said Flory. 'Have you just arrived?'<br><br>'Last night, got in by the late train.' He had a surly, boyish<br>voice. 'I've been sent up here with a company of men to stand by<br>in case your local bad-mashes start any trouble. My name's<br>Verrall--Military Police,' he added, not, however, inquiring<br>Flory's name in return.<br><br>'Oh yes. We heard they were sending somebody. Where are you<br>putting up?'<br><br>'Dak bungalow, for the time being. There was some black beggar<br>staying there when I got in last night--Excise Officer or<br>something. I booted him out. This is a filthy hole, isn't it?' he<br>said with a backward movement of his head, indicating the whole of<br>Kyauktada.<br><br>'I suppose it's like the rest of these small stations. Are you<br>staying long?'<br><br>'Only a month or so, thank God. Till the rains break. What a<br>rotten maidan you've got here, haven't you? Pity they can't keep<br>this stuff cut,' he added, swishing the dried-up grass with the<br>point of his spear. 'Makes it so hopeless for polo or anything.'<br><br>'I'm afraid you won't get any polo here,' Flory said. 'Tennis is<br>the best we can manage. There are only eight of us all told, and<br>most of us spend three-quarters of our time in the jungle.'<br><br>'Christ! What a hole!'<br><br>After this there was a silence. The tall, bearded Sikhs stood in a<br>group round their horses' heads, eyeing Flory without much favour.<br>It was perfectly clear that Verral was bored with the conversation<br>and wanted to escape. Flory had never in his life felt so<br>completely de trop, or so old and shabby. He noticed that<br>Verrall's pony was a beautiful Arab, a mare, with proud neck and<br>arching, plume-like tail; a lovely milk-white thing, worth several<br>thousands of rupees. Verrall had already twitched the bridle to<br>turn away, evidently feeling that he had talked enough for one<br>morning.<br><br>'That's a wonderful pony of yours,' Flory said.<br><br>'She's not bad, better than these Burma scrubs. I've come out to<br>do a bit of tent-pegging. It's hopeless trying to knock a polo<br>ball about in this muck. Hey, Hira Singh!' he called, and turned<br>his pony away.<br><br>The sepoy holding the bay pony handed his bridle to a companion,<br>ran to a spot forty yards away, and fixed a narrow boxwood peg in<br>the ground. Verral took no further notice of Flory. He raised his<br>spear and poised himself as though taking aim at the peg, while the<br>Indians backed their horses out of the way and stood watching<br>critically. With a just perceptible movement Verrall dug his knees<br>into the pony's sides. She bounded forward like a bullet from a<br>catapult. As easily as a centaur the lank, straight youth leaned<br>over in the saddle, lowered his spear and plunged it clean through<br>the peg. One of the Indians muttered gruffly 'Shabash!' Verrall<br>raised his spear behind him in the orthodox fashion, and then,<br>pulling his horse to a canter, wheeled round and handed the<br>transfixed peg to the sepoy.<br><br>Verrall rode twice more at the peg, and hit it each time. It was<br>done with matchless grace and with extraordinary solemnity. The<br>whole group of men, Englishman and Indians, were concentrated upon<br>the business of hitting the peg as though it had been a religious<br>ritual. Flory still stood watching, disregarded--Verrall's face<br>was one of those that are specially constructed for ignoring<br>unwelcome strangers--but from the very fact that he had been<br>snubbed unable to tear himself away. Somehow, Verrall had filled<br>him with a horrible sense of inferiority. He was trying to think<br>of some pretext for renewing the conversation, when he looked up<br>the hillside and saw Elizabeth, in pale blue, coming out of her<br>uncle's gate. She must have seen the third transfixing of the peg.<br>His heart stirred painfully. A thought occurred to him, one of<br>those rash thoughts that usually lead to trouble. He called to<br>Verrall, who was a few yards away from him, and pointed with his<br>stick.<br><br>'Do these other two know how to do it?'<br><br>Verrall looked over his shoulder with a surly air. He had expected<br>Flory to go away after being ignored.<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Can these other two do it?' Flory repeated.<br><br>'The chestnut's not bad. Bolts if you let him, though.'<br><br>'Let me have a shot at the peg, would you?'<br><br>'All right,' said Verrall ungraciously. 'Don't go and cut his<br>mouth to bits.'<br><br>A sepoy brought the pony, and Flory pretended to examine the curb-<br>chain. In reality he was temporizing until Elizabeth should be<br>thirty or forty yards away. He made up his mind that he would<br>stick the peg exactly at the moment when she passed (it is easy<br>enough on the small Burma ponies, provided that they will gallop<br>straight), and then ride up to her with it on his point. That was<br>obviously the right move. He did not want her to think that that<br>pink-faced young whelp was the only person who could ride. He was<br>wearing shorts, which are uncomfortable to ride in, but he knew<br>that, like nearly everyone, he looked his best on horseback.<br><br>Elizabeth was approaching. Flory stepped into the saddle, took the<br>spear from the Indian and waved it in greeting to Elizabeth. She<br>made no response, however. Probably she was shy in front of<br>Verrall. She was looking away, towards the cemetery, and her<br>cheeks were pink.<br><br>'Chalo,' said Flory to the Indian, and then dug his knees into the<br>horse's sides.<br><br>The very next instant, before the horse had taken to bounds, Flory<br>found himself hurtling through the air, hitting the ground with a<br>crack that wrenched his shoulder almost out of joint, and rolling<br>over and over. Mercifully the spear fell clear of him. He lay<br>supine, with a blurred vision of blue sky and floating vultures.<br>Then his eyes focused on the khaki pagri and dark face of a Sikh,<br>bearded to the eyes, bending over him.<br><br>'What's happened?' he said in English, and he raised himself<br>painfully on his elbow. The Sikh made some gruff answer and<br>pointed. Flory saw the chestnut pony careering away over the<br>maidan, with the saddle under its belly. The girth had not been<br>tightened, and had slipped round; hence his fall.<br><br>When Flory sat up he found that he was in extreme pain. The right<br>shoulder of his shirt was torn open and already soaking with blood,<br>and he could feel more blood oozing from his cheek. The hard earth<br>had grazed him. His hat, too, was gone. With a deadly pang he<br>remembered Elizabeth, and he saw her coming towards him, barely ten<br>yards away, looking straight at him as he sprawled there so<br>ignominiously. My God, my God! he thought, O my God, what a fool I<br>must look! The thought of it even drove away the pain of the fall.<br>He clapped a hand over his birth-mark, though the other cheek was<br>the damaged one.<br><br>'Elizabeth! Hullo, Elizabeth! Good morning!'<br><br>He had called out eagerly, appealingly, as one does when one is<br>conscious of looking a fool. She did not answer, and what was<br>almost incredible, she walked on without pausing even for an<br>instant, as though she had neither seen nor heard him.<br><br>'Elizabeth!' he called again, taken aback; 'did you see my fall?<br>The saddle slipped. The fool of a sepoy hadn't--'<br><br>There was no question that she had heard him now. She turned her<br>face full upon him for a moment, and looked at him and through him<br>as though he had not existed. Then she gazed away into the<br>distance beyond the cemetery. It was terrible. He called after<br>her in dismay--<br><br>'Elizabeth! I say, Elizabeth!'<br><br>She passed on without a word, without a sign, without a look. She<br>was walking sharply down the road, with a click of heels, her back<br>turned upon him.<br><br>The sepoys had come round him now, and Verrall, too, had ridden<br>across to where Flory lay. Some of the sepoys had saluted<br>Elizabeth; Verrall had ignored her, perhaps not seeing her. Flory<br>rose stiffly to his feet. He was badly bruised, but no bones were<br>broken. The Indians brought him his hat and stick, but they did<br>not apologize for their carelessness. They looked faintly<br>contemptuous, as though thinking that he had only got what he<br>deserved. It was conceivable that they had loosened the girth on<br>purpose.<br><br>'The saddle slipped,' said Flory in the weak, stupid way that one<br>does at such moments.<br><br>'Why the devil couldn't you look at it before you got up?' said<br>Verrall briefly. 'You ought to know these beggars aren't to be<br>trusted.'<br><br>Having said which he twitched his bridle and rode away, feeling the<br>incident closed. The sepoys followed him without saluting Flory.<br>When Flory reached his gate he looked back and saw that the<br>chestnut pony had already been caught and re-saddled, and Verrall<br>was tent-pegging upon it.<br><br>The fall had so shaken him that even now he could hardly collect<br>his thoughts. What could have made her behave like that? She had<br>seen him lying bloody and in pain, and she had walked past him as<br>though he had been a dead dog. How could it have happened? HAD it<br>happened? It was incredible. Could she be angry with him? Could<br>he have offended her in any way? All the servants were waiting at<br>the compound fence. They had come out to watch the tent-pegging,<br>and every one of them had seen his bitter humiliation. Ko S'la ran<br>part of the way down the hill to meet him, with concerned face.<br><br>'The god has hurt himself? Shall I carry the god back to the<br>house?'<br><br>'No,' said the god. 'Go and get me some whisky and a clean shirt.'<br><br>When they got back to the house Ko S'la made Flory sit down on the<br>bed and peeled off his torn shirt which the blood had stuck to his<br>body. Ko S'la clicked his tongue.<br><br>'Ah ma lay? These cuts are full of dirt. You ought not to play<br>these children's games on strange ponies, thakin. Not at your age.<br>It is too dangerous.'<br><br>'The saddle slipped,' Flory said.<br><br>'Such games,' pursued Ko S'la, 'are all very well for the young<br>police officer. But you are no longer young, thakin. A fall hurts<br>at your age. You should take more care of yourself.'<br><br>'Do you take me for an old man?' said Flory angrily. His shoulder<br>was smarting abominably.<br><br>'You are thirty-five, thakin,' said Ko S'la politely but firmly.<br><br>It was all very humiliating. Ma Pu and Ma Yi, temporarily at<br>peace, had brought a pot of some dreadful mess which they declared<br>was good for cuts. Flory told Ko S'la privately to throw it out of<br>the window and substitute boracic ointment. Then, while he sat in<br>a tepid bath and Ko S'la sponged the dirt out of his grazes, he<br>puzzled helplessly, and, as his head grew clearer, with a deeper<br>and deeper dismay, over what had happened. He had offended her<br>bitterly, that was clear. But, when he had not even seen her since<br>last night, how COULD he have offended her? And there was no even<br>plausible answer.<br><br>He explained to Ko S'la several times over that his fall was due to<br>the saddle slipping. But Ko S'la, though sympathetic, clearly did<br>not believe him. To the end of his days, Flory perceived, the fall<br>would be attributed to his own bad horsemanship. On the other<br>hand, a fortnight ago, he had won undeserved renown by putting to<br>flight the harmless buffalo. Fate is even-handed, after a fashion. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/14.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/16.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
