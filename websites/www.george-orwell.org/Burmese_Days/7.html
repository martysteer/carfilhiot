<h2>Chapter 8</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">That evening Flory told Ko S'la to send for the barber--he was the<br>only barber in the town, an Indian, and he made a living by shaving<br>the Indian coolies at the rate of eight annas a month for a dry<br>shave every other day. The Europeans patronized him for lack of<br>any other. The barber was waiting on the veranda when Flory came<br>back from tennis, and Flory sterilized the scissors with boiling<br>water and Condy's fluid and had his hair cut.<br><br>'Lay out my best Palm Beach suit,' he told Ko S'la, 'and a silk<br>shirt and my sambhur-skin shoes. Also that new tie that came from<br>Rangoon last week.'<br><br>'I have done so, thakin,' said Ko S'la, meaning that he would do<br>so. When Flory came into the bedroom he found Ko S'la waiting<br>beside the clothes he had laid out, with a faintly sulky air. It<br>was immediately apparent that Ko S'la knew why Flory was dressing<br>himself up (that is, in hopes of meeting Elizabeth) and that he<br>disapproved of it.<br><br>'What are you waiting for?' Flory said.<br><br>'To help you dress, thakin.'<br><br>'I shall dress myself this evening. You can go.'<br><br>He was going to shave--the second time that day--and he did not<br>want Ko S'la to see him take shaving things into the bathroom.<br>It was several years since he had shaved twice in one day. What<br>providential luck that he had sent for that new tie only last week,<br>he thought. He dressed himself very carefully, and spent nearly a<br>quarter of an hour in brushing his hair, which was stiff and would<br>never lie down after it had been cut.<br><br>Almost the next moment, as it seemed, he was walking with Elizabeth<br>down the bazaar road. He had found her alone in the Club 'library',<br>and with a sudden burst of courage asked her to come out with him;<br>and she had come with a readiness that surprised him; not even<br>stopping to say anything to her uncle and aunt. He had lived so<br>long in Burma, he had forgotten English ways. It was very dark<br>under the peepul trees of the bazaar road, the foliage hiding the<br>quarter moon, but the stars here and there in a gap blazed white and<br>low, like lamps hanging on invisible threads. Successive waves of<br>scent came rolling, first the cloying sweetness of frangipani, then<br>a cold putrid stench of dung or decay from the huts opposite Dr<br>Veraswami's bungalow. Drums were throbbing a little distance away.<br><br>As he heard the drums Flory remembered that a pwe was being acted a<br>little farther down the road, opposite U Po Kyin's house; in fact,<br>it was U Po Kyin who had made arrangements for the pwe, though<br>someone else had paid for it. A daring thought occurred to Flory.<br>He would take Elizabeth to the pwe! She would love it--she must;<br>no one with eyes in his head could resist a pwe-dance. Probably<br>there would be a scandal when they came back to the Club together<br>after a long absence; but damn it! what did it matter? She was<br>different from that herd of fools at the Club. And it would be<br>such fun to go to the pwe together! At this moment the music burst<br>out with a fearful pandemonium--a strident squeal of pipes, a<br>rattle like castanets and the hoarse thump of drums, above which a<br>man's voice was brassily squalling.<br><br>'Whatever is that noise?' said Elizabeth, stopping. 'It sounds<br>just like a jazz band!'<br><br>'Native music. They're having a pwe--that's a kind of Burmese<br>play; a cross between a historical drama and a revue, if you can<br>imagine that. It'll interest you, I think. Just round the bend of<br>the road here.'<br><br>'Oh,' she said rather doubtfully.<br><br>They came round the bend into a glare of light. The whole road for<br>thirty yards was blocked by the audience watching the pwe. At the<br>back there was a raised stage, under humming petrol lamps, with the<br>orchestra squalling and banging in front of it; on the stage two<br>men dressed in clothes that reminded Elizabeth of Chinese pagodas<br>were posturing with curved swords in their hands. All down the<br>roadway it was a sea of white muslin backs of women, pink scarves<br>flung round their shoulders and black hair-cylinders. A few<br>sprawled on their mats, fast asleep. An old Chinese with a tray of<br>peanuts was threading his way through the crowd, intoning<br>mournfully, 'Myaype! Myaype!'<br><br>'We'll stop and watch a few minutes if you like,' Flory said.<br><br>The blaze of lights and the appalling din of the orchestra had<br>almost dazed Elizabeth, but what startled her most of all was the<br>sight of this crowd of people sitting in the road as though it had<br>been the pit of a theatre.<br><br>'Do they always have their plays in the middle of the road?' she<br>said.<br><br>'As a rule. They put up a rough stage and take it down in the<br>morning. The show lasts all night.'<br><br>'But are they ALLOWED to--blocking up the whole roadway?'<br><br>'Oh yes. There are no traffic regulations here. No traffic to<br>regulate, you see.'<br><br>It struck her as very queer. By this time almost the entire<br>audience had turned round on their mats to stare at the 'Ingaleikma'.<br>There were half a dozen chairs in the middle of the crowd, where<br>some clerks and officials were sitting. U Po Kyin was among them,<br>and he was making efforts to twist his elephantine body round and<br>greet the Europeans. As the music stopped the pock-marked Ba Taik<br>came hastening through the crowd and shikoed low to Flory, with his<br>timorous air.<br><br>'Most holy one, my master U Po Kyin asks whether you and the young<br>white lady will not come and watch our pwe for a few minutes. He<br>has chairs ready for you.'<br><br>'They're asking us to come and sit down,' Flory said to Elizabeth.<br>'Would you like to? It's rather fun. Those two fellows will clear<br>off in a moment and there'll be some dancing. If it wouldn't bore<br>you for a few minutes?'<br><br>Elizabeth felt very doubtful. Somehow it did not seem right or<br>even safe to go in among that smelly native crowd. However, she<br>trusted Flory, who presumably knew what was proper, and allowed him<br>to lead her to the chairs. The Burmans made way on their mats,<br>gazing after her and chattering; her shins brushed against warm,<br>muslin-clad bodies, there was a feral reek of sweat. U Po Kyin<br>leaned over towards her, bowing as well as he could and saying<br>nasally:<br><br>'Kindly to sit down, madam! I am most honoured to make your<br>acquaintance. Good evening. Good morning, Mr Flory, sir! A most<br>unexpected pleasure. Had we known that you were to honour us with<br>your company, we would have provided whiskies and other European<br>refreshments. Ha ha!'<br><br>He laughed, and his betel-reddened teeth gleamed in the lamplight<br>like red tinfoil. He was so vast and so hideous that Elizabeth<br>could not help shrinking from him. A slender youth in a purple<br>longyi was bowing to her and holding out a tray with two glasses of<br>yellow sherbet, iced. U Po Kyin clapped his hands sharply, 'Hey<br>haung galay!' he called to a boy beside him. He gave some<br>instructions in Burmese, and the boy pushed his way to the edge of<br>the stage.<br><br>'He's telling them to bring on their best dancer in our honour,'<br>Flory said. 'Look, here she comes.'<br><br>A girl who had been squatting at the back of the stage, smoking,<br>stepped forward into the lamplight. She was very young, slim-<br>shouldered, breastless, dressed in a pale blue satin longyi that<br>hid her feet. The skirts of her ingyi curved outwards above her<br>hips in little panniers, according to the ancient Burmese fashion.<br>They were like the petals of a downward-pointing flower. She threw<br>her cigar languidly to one of the men in the orchestra, and then,<br>holding out one slender arm, writhed it as though to shake the<br>muscles loose.<br><br>The orchestra burst into a sudden loud squalling. There were pipes<br>like bagpipes, a strange instrument consisting of plaques of bamboo<br>which a man struck with a little hammer, and in the middle there<br>was a man surrounded by twelve tall drums of different sizes. He<br>reached rapidly from one to another, thumping them with the heel of<br>his hand. In a moment the girl began to dance. But at first it<br>was not a dance, it was a rhythmic nodding, posturing and twisting<br>of the elbows, like the movements of one of those jointed wooden<br>figures on an old-fashioned roundabout. The way her neck and<br>elbows rotated was precisely like a jointed doll, and yet<br>incredibly sinuous. Her hands, twisting like snakeheads with the<br>fingers close together, could lie back until they were almost along<br>her forearms. By degrees her movements quickened. She began to<br>leap from side to side, flinging herself down in a kind of curtsy<br>and springing up again with extraordinary agility, in spite of the<br>long longyi that imprisoned her feet. Then she danced in a<br>grotesque posture as though sitting down, knees bent, body leaned<br>forward, with her arms extended and writhing, her head also moving<br>to the beat of the drums. The music quickened to a climax. The<br>girl rose upright and whirled round as swiftly as a top, the<br>pannier of her ingyi flying out about her like the petals of a<br>snowdrop. Then the music stopped as abruptly as it had begun, and<br>the girl sank again into a curtsy, amid raucous shouting from the<br>audience.<br><br>Elizabeth watched the dance with a mixture of amazement, boredom<br>and something approaching horror. She had sipped her drink and<br>found that it tasted like hair oil. On a mat by her feet three<br>Burmese girls lay fast asleep with their heads on the same pillow,<br>their small oval faces side by side like the faces of kittens.<br>Under cover of the music Flory was speaking in a low voice into<br>Elizabeth's ear commenting on the dance.<br><br>'I knew this would interest you; that's why I brought you here.<br>You've read books and been in civilized places, you're not like the<br>rest of us miserable savages here. Don't you think this is worth<br>watching, in its queer way? Just look at that girl's movements--<br>look at that strange, bent-forward pose like a marionette, and the<br>way her arms twist from the elbow like a cobra rising to strike.<br>It's grotesque, it's even ugly, with a sort of wilful ugliness.<br>And there's something sinister in it too. There's a touch of the<br>diabolical in all Mongols. And yet when you look closely, what<br>art, what centuries of culture you can see behind it! Every<br>movement that girl makes has been studied and handed down through<br>innumerable generations. Whenever you look closely at the art of<br>these Eastern peoples you can see that--a civilization stretching<br>back and back, practically the same, into times when we were<br>dressed in woad. In some way that I can't define to you, the whole<br>life and spirit of Burma is summed up in the way that girl twists<br>her arms. When you see her you can see the rice fields, the<br>villages under the teak trees, the pagodas, the priests in their<br>yellow robes, the buffaloes swimming the rivers in the early<br>morning, Thibaw's palace--'<br><br>His voice stopped abruptly as the music stopped. There were<br>certain things, and a pwe-dance was one of them, that pricked him<br>to talk discursively and incautiously; but now he realized that he<br>had only been talking like a character in a novel, and not a very<br>good novel. He looked away. Elizabeth had listened to him with a<br>chill of discomfort. What WAS the man talking about? was her first<br>thought. Moreover, she had caught the hated word Art more than<br>once. For the first time she remembered that Flory was a total<br>stranger and that it had been unwise to come out with him alone.<br>She looked round her, at the sea of dark faces and the lurid glare<br>of the lamps; the strangeness of the scene almost frightened her.<br>What was she doing in this place? Surely it was not right to be<br>sitting among the black people like this, almost touching them, in<br>the scent of their garlic and their sweat? Why was she not back at<br>the Club with the other white people? Why had he brought her here,<br>among this horde of natives, to watch this hideous and savage<br>spectacle?<br><br>The music struck up, and the pwe girl began dancing again. Her<br>face was powdered so thickly that it gleamed in the lamplight like<br>a chalk mask with live eyes behind it. With that dead-white oval<br>face and those wooden gestures she was monstrous, like a demon.<br>The music changed its tempo, and the girl began to sing in a brassy<br>voice. It was a song with a swift trochaic rhythm, gay yet fierce.<br>The crowd took it up, a hundred voices chanting the harsh syllables<br>in unison. Still in that strange bent posture the girl turned<br>round and danced with her buttocks protruded towards the audience.<br>Her silk longyi gleamed like metal. With hands and elbows still<br>rotating she wagged her posterior from side to side. Then--<br>astonishing feat, quite visible through the longyi--she began to<br>wriggle her two buttocks independently in time with the music.<br><br>There was a shout of applause from the audience. The three girls<br>asleep on the mat woke up at the same moment and began clapping<br>their hands wildly. A clerk shouted nasally 'Bravo! Bravo!' in<br>English for the Europeans' benefit. But U Po Kyin frowned and<br>waved his hand. He knew all about European women. Elizabeth,<br>however, had already stood up.<br><br>'I'm going. It's time we were back,' she said abruptly. She was<br>looking away, but Flory could see that her face was pink.<br><br>He stood up beside her, dismayed. 'But, I say! Couldn't you stay<br>a few minutes longer? I know it's late, but--they brought this<br>girl on two hours before she was due, in our honour. Just a few<br>minutes?'<br><br>'I can't help it, I ought to have been back ages ago. I don't know<br>WHAT my uncle and aunt will be thinking.'<br><br>She began at once to pick her way through the crowd, and he<br>followed her, with not even time to thank the pwe people for their<br>trouble. The Burmans made way with a sulky air. How like these<br>English people, to upset everything by sending for the best dancer<br>and then go away almost before she had started! There was a<br>fearful row as soon as Flory and Elizabeth had gone, the pwe girl<br>refusing to go on with her dance and the audience demanding that<br>she should continue. However, peace was restored when two clowns<br>hurried on to the stage and began letting off crackers and making<br>obscene jokes.<br><br>Flory followed the girl abjectly up the road. She was walking<br>quickly, her head turned away, and for some moments she would not<br>speak. What a thing to happen, when they had been getting on so<br>well together! He kept trying to apologize.<br><br>'I'm so sorry! I'd no idea you'd mind--'<br><br>'It's nothing. What is there to be sorry about? I only said it<br>was time to go back, that's all.'<br><br>'I ought to have thought. One gets not to notice that kind of<br>thing in this country. These people's sense of decency isn't the<br>same as ours--it's stricter in some ways--but--'<br><br>'It's not that! It's not that!' she exclaimed quite angrily.<br><br>He saw that he was only making it worse. They walked on in<br>silence, he behind. He was miserable. What a bloody fool he had<br>been! And yet all the while he had no inkling of the real reason<br>why she was angry with him. It was not the pwe girl's behaviour,<br>in itself, that had offended her; it had only brought things to a<br>head. But the whole expedition--the very notion of WANTING to rub<br>shoulders with all those smelly natives--had impressed her badly.<br>She was perfectly certain that that was not how white men ought to<br>behave. And that extraordinary rambling speech that he had begun,<br>with all those long words--almost, she thought bitterly, as though<br>he were quoting poetry! It was how those beastly artists that you<br>met sometimes in Paris used to talk. She had thought him a manly<br>man till this evening. Then her mind went back to the morning's<br>adventure, and how he had faced the buffalo barehanded, and some of<br>her anger evaporated. By the time they reached the Club gate she<br>felt inclined to forgive him. Flory had by now plucked up courage<br>to speak again. He stopped, and she stopped too, in a patch where<br>the boughs let through some starlight and he could see her face<br>dimly.<br><br>'I say. I say, I do hope you're not really angry about this?'<br><br>'No, of course I'm not. I told you I wasn't.'<br><br>'I oughtn't to have taken you there. Please forgive me. Do you<br>know, I don't think I'd tell the others where you've been. Perhaps<br>it would be better to say you've just been out for a stroll, out in<br>the garden--something like that. They might think it queer, a<br>white girl going to a pwe. I don't think I'd tell them.'<br><br>'Oh, of course I won't!' she agreed with a warmness that surprised<br>him. After that he knew that he was forgiven. But what it was<br>that he was forgiven, he had not yet grasped.<br><br>They went into the Club separately, by tacit consent. The expedition<br>had been a failure, decidedly. There was a gala air about the Club<br>lounge tonight. The entire European community were waiting to greet<br>Elizabeth, and the butler and the six chokras, in their best<br>starched white suits, were drawn up on either side of the door,<br>smiling and salaaming. When the Europeans had finished their<br>greetings the butler came forward with a vast garland of flowers<br>that the servants had prepared for the 'missiesahib'. Mr Macgregor<br>made a very humorous speech of welcome, introducing everybody. He<br>introduced Maxwell as 'our local arboreal specialist', Westfield as<br>'the guardian of law and order and--ah--terror of the local<br>banditti', and so on and so forth. There was much laughter. The<br>sight of a pretty girl's face had put everyone in such a good humour<br>that they could even enjoy Mr Macgregor's speech--which, to tell the<br>truth, he had spent most of the evening in preparing.<br><br>At the first possible moment Ellis, with a sly air, took Flory and<br>Westfield by the arm and drew them away into the card-room. He was<br>in a much better mood than usual. He pinched Flory's arm with his<br>small, hard fingers, painfully but quite amiably.<br><br>'Well, my lad, everyone's been looking for you. Where have you<br>been all this time?'<br><br>'Oh, only for a stroll.'<br><br>'For a stroll! And who with?'<br><br>'With Miss Lackersteen.'<br><br>'I knew it! So YOU'RE the bloody fool who's fallen into the trap,<br>are you? YOU swallowed the bait before anyone else had time to<br>look at it. I thought you were too old a bird for that, by God I<br>did!'<br><br>'What do you mean?'<br><br>'Mean! Look at him pretending he doesn't know what I mean! Why, I<br>mean that Ma Lackersteen's marked you down for her beloved nephew-<br>in-law, of course. That is, if you aren't bloody careful. Eh,<br>Westfield?'<br><br>'Quite right, ol' boy. Eligible young bachelor. Marriage halter<br>and all that. They've got their eye on him.'<br><br>'I don't know where you're getting this idea from. The girl's<br>hardly been here twenty-four hours.'<br><br>'Long enough for you to take her up the garden path, anyway. You<br>watch your step. Tom Lackersteen may be a drunken sot, but he's<br>not such a bloody fool that he wants a niece hanging round his neck<br>for the rest of his life. And of course SHE knows which side her<br>bread's buttered. So you take care and don't go putting your head<br>into the noose.'<br><br>'Damn it, you've no right to talk about people like that. After<br>all, the girl's only a kid--'<br><br>'My dear old ass'--Ellis, almost affectionate now that he had a new<br>subject for scandal, took Flory by the coat lapel--'my dear, dear<br>old ass, don't you go filling yourself up with moonshine. You<br>think that girl's easy fruit: she's not. These girls out from home<br>are all the same. "Anything in trousers but nothing this side the<br>altar"--that's their motto, every one of them. Why do you think<br>the girl's come out here?'<br><br>'Why? I don't know. Because she wanted to, I suppose.'<br><br>'My good fool! She come out to lay her claws into a husband,<br>of course. As if it wasn't well known! When a girl's failed<br>everywhere else she tries India, where every man's pining for the<br>sight of a white woman. The Indian marriage-market, they call it.<br>Meat market it ought to be. Shiploads of 'em coming out every year<br>like carcasses of frozen mutton, to be pawed over by nasty old<br>bachelors like you. Cold storage. Juicy joints straight from the<br>ice.'<br><br>'You do say some repulsive things.'<br><br>'Best pasture-fed English meat,' said Ellis with a pleased air.<br>'Fresh consignments. Warranted prime condition.'<br><br>He went through a pantomime of examining a joint of meat, with<br>goatish sniffs. This joke was likely to last Ellis a long time;<br>his jokes usually did; and there was nothing that gave him quite so<br>keen a pleasure as dragging a woman's name through mud.<br><br>Flory did not see much more of Elizabeth that evening. Everyone<br>was in the lounge together, and there was the silly clattering<br>chatter about nothing that there is on these occasions. Flory<br>could never keep up that kind of conversation for long. But as for<br>Elizabeth, the civilized atmosphere of the Club, with the white<br>faces all round her and the friendly look of the illustrated papers<br>and the 'Bonzo' pictures, reassured her after that doubtful<br>interlude at the pwe.<br><br>When the Lackersteens left the Club at nine, it was not Flory but<br>Mr Macgregor who walked home with them, ambling beside Elizabeth<br>like some friendly saurian monster, among the faint crooked shadows<br>of the gold mohur stems. The Prome anecdote, and many another,<br>found a new home. Any newcomer to Kyauktada was apt to come in for<br>rather a large share of Mr Macgregor's conversation, for the others<br>looked on him as an unparalleled bore, and it was a tradition at<br>the Club to interrupt his stories. But Elizabeth was by nature a<br>good listener. Mr Macgregor thought he had seldom met so<br>intelligent a girl.<br><br>Flory stayed a little longer at the Club, drinking with the others.<br>There was much smutty talk about Elizabeth. The quarrel about Dr<br>Veraswami's election had been shelved for the time being. Also,<br>the notice that Ellis had put up on the previous evening had been<br>taken down. Mr Macgregor had seen it during his morning visit to<br>the Club, and in his fair-minded way he had at once insisted on its<br>removal. So the notice had been suppressed; not, however, before<br>it had achieved its object. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/6.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/8.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
