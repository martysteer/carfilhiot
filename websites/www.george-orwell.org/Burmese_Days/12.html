<h2>Chapter 13</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">As Flory came through the gate of the hospital compound four<br>ragged sweepers passed him, carrying some dead coolie, wrapped in<br>sackcloth, to a foot-deep grave in the jungle. Flory crossed the<br>brick-like earth of the yard between the hospital sheds. All down<br>the wide verandas, on sheetless charpoys, rows of grey-faced men<br>lay silent and moveless. Some filthy-looking curs, which were said<br>to devour amputated limbs, dozed or snapped at their fleas among<br>the piles of the buildings. The whole place wore a sluttish and<br>decaying air. Dr Veraswami struggled hard to keep it clean, but<br>there was no coping with the dust and the bad water-supply, and the<br>inertia of sweepers and half-trained Assistant Surgeons.<br><br>Flory was told that the doctor was in the out-patients' department.<br>It was a plaster-walled room furnished only with a table and two<br>chairs, and a dusty portrait of Queen Victoria, much awry. A<br>procession of Burmans, peasants with gnarled muscles beneath their<br>faded rags, were filing into the room and queueing up at the table.<br>The doctor was in shirt-sleeves and sweating profusely. He sprang<br>to his feet with an exclamation of pleasure, and in his usual fussy<br>haste thrust Flory into the vacant chair and produced a tin of<br>cigarettes from the drawer of the table.<br><br>'What a delightful visit, Mr Flory! Please to make yourself<br>comfortable--that iss, if one can possibly be comfortable in such a<br>place ass this, ha, ha! Afterwards, at my house, we will talk with<br>beer and amenities. Kindly excuse me while I attend to the<br>populace.'<br><br>Flory sat down, and the hot sweat immediately burst out and<br>drenched his shirt. The heat of the room was stifling. The<br>peasants steamed garlic from all their pores. As each man came to<br>the table the doctor would bounce from his chair, prod the patient<br>in the back, lay a black ear to his chest, fire off several<br>questions in villainous Burmese, then bounce back to the table and<br>scribble a prescription. The patients took the prescriptions<br>across the yard to the Compounder, who gave them bottles filled<br>with water and various vegetable dyes. The Compounder supported<br>himself largely by the sale of drugs, for the Government paid him<br>only twenty-five rupees a month. However, the doctor knew nothing<br>of this.<br><br>On most mornings the doctor had not time to attend to the out-<br>patients himself, and left them to one of the Assistant Surgeons.<br>The Assistant Surgeon's methods of diagnosis were brief. He would<br>simply ask each patient, 'Where is your pain? Head, back or<br>belly?' and at the reply hand out a prescription from one of three<br>piles that he had prepared beforehand. The patients much preferred<br>this method to the doctor's. The doctor had a way of asking them<br>whether they had suffered from venereal diseases--an ungentlemanly,<br>pointless question--and sometimes he horrified them still more by<br>suggesting operations. 'Belly-cutting' was their phrase for it.<br>The majority of them would have died a dozen times over rather than<br>submit to 'belly-cutting'.<br><br>As the last patient disappeared the doctor sank into his chair,<br>fanning his face with the prescription-pad.<br><br>'Ach, this heat! Some mornings I think that never will I get the<br>smell of garlic out of my nose! It iss amazing to me how their<br>very blood becomes impregnated with it. Are you not suffocated,<br>Mr Flory? You English have the sense of smell almost too highly<br>developed. What torments you must all suffer in our filthy East!'<br><br>'Abandon your noses, all ye who enter here, what? They might write<br>that up over the Suez Canal. You seem busy this morning?'<br><br>'Ass ever. Ah but, my friend, how discouraging iss the work of a<br>doctor in this country! These villagers--dirty, ignorant savages!<br>Even to get them to come to hospital iss all we can do, and they<br>will die of gangrene or carry a tumour ass large ass a melon for<br>ten years rather than face the knife. And such medicines ass their<br>own so-called doctors give to them! Herbs gathered under the new<br>moon, tigers' whiskers, rhinoceros horn, urine, menstrual blood!<br>How men can drink such compounds iss disgusting.'<br><br>'Rather picturesque, all the same. You ought to compile a Burmese<br>pharmacopoeia, doctor. It would be almost as good as Culpeper.'<br><br>'Barbarous cattle, barbarous cattle,' said the doctor, beginning to<br>struggle into his white coat. 'Shall we go back to my house?<br>There iss beer and I trust a few fragments of ice left. I have an<br>operation at ten, strangulated hernia, very urgent. Till then I am<br>free.'<br><br>'Yes. As a matter of fact there's something I rather wanted to<br>talk to you about.'<br><br>They recrossed the yard and climbed the steps of the doctor's<br>veranda. The doctor, having felt in the ice-chest and found that<br>the ice was all melted to tepid water, opened a bottle of beer and<br>called fussily to the servants to set some more bottles swinging in<br>a cradle of wet straw. Flory was standing looking over the veranda<br>rail, with his hat still on. The fact was that he had come here to<br>utter an apology. He had been avoiding the doctor for nearly a<br>fortnight--since the day, in fact, when he had set his name to the<br>insulting notice at the Club. But the apology had got to be<br>uttered. U Po Kyin was a very good judge of men, but he had erred<br>in supposing that two anonymous letters were enough to scare Flory<br>permanently away from his friend.<br><br>'Look here, doctor, you know what I wanted to say?'<br><br>'I? No.'<br><br>'Yes, you do. It's about that beastly trick I played on you the<br>other week. When Ellis put that notice on the Club board and I<br>signed my name to it. You must have heard about it. I want to try<br>and explain--'<br><br>'No, no, my friend, no, no!' The doctor was so distressed that he<br>sprang across the veranda and seized Flory by the arm. 'You shall<br>NOT explain! Please never mention it! I understand perfectly--but<br>most perfectly.'<br><br>'No, you don't understand. You couldn't. You don't realize just<br>what KIND of pressure is put on one to make one do things like<br>that. There was nothing to make me sign the notice. Nothing could<br>have happened if I'd refused. There's no law telling us to be<br>beastly to Orientals--quite the contrary. But--it's just that one<br>daren't be loyal to an Oriental when it means going against the<br>others. It doesn't DO. If I'd stuck out against signing the<br>notice I'd have been in disgrace at the Club for a week or two.<br>So I funked it, as usual.'<br><br>'Please, Mr Flory, please! Possitively you will make me<br>uncomfortable if you continue. Ass though I could not make all<br>allowances for your position!'<br><br>'Our motto, you know is, "In India, do as the English do".'<br><br>'Of course, of course. And a most noble motto. "Hanging<br>together", ass you call it. It iss the secret of your superiority<br>to we Orientals.'<br><br>'Well, it's never much use saying one's sorry. But what I did come<br>here to say was that it shan't happen again. In fact--'<br><br>'Now, now, Mr Flory, you will oblige me by saying no more upon this<br>subject. It iss all over and forgotten. Please to drink up your<br>beer before it becomes ass hot ass tea. Also, I have a thing to<br>tell you. You have not asked for my news yet.'<br><br>'Ah, your news. What is your news, by the way? How's everything<br>been going all this time? How's Ma Britannia? Still moribund?'<br><br>'Aha, very low, very low! But not so low ass I. I am in deep<br>waters, my friend.'<br><br>'What? U Po Kyin again? Is he still libelling you?'<br><br>'If he iss libelling me! This time it iss--well, it iss something<br>diabolical. My friend, you have heard of this rebellion that is<br>supposed to be on the point of breaking out in the district?'<br><br>'I've heard a lot of talk. Westfield's been out bent on slaughter,<br>but I hear he can't find any rebels. Only the usual village<br>Hampdens who won't pay their taxes.'<br><br>'Ah yes. Wretched fools! Do you know how much iss the tax that<br>most of them have refused to pay? Five rupees! They will get<br>tired of it and pay up presently. We have this trouble every year.<br>But ass for the rebellion--the SO-CALLED rebellion, Mr Flory--I<br>wish you to know that there iss more in it than meets the eye.'<br><br>'Oh? What?'<br><br>To Flory's surprise the doctor made such a violent gesture of anger<br>that he spilled most of his beer. He put his glass down on the<br>veranda rail and burst out:<br><br>'It iss U Po Kyin again! That unutterable scoundrel! That<br>crocodile deprived of natural feeling! That--that--'<br><br>'Go on. "That obscene trunk of humors, that swol'n parcel of<br>dropsies, that bolting-hutch of beastliness"--go on. What's he<br>been up to now?'<br><br>'A villainy unparalleled'--and here the doctor outlined the plot<br>for a sham rebellion, very much as U Po Kyin had explained it to Ma<br>Kin. The only detail not known to him was U Po Kyin's intention of<br>getting himself elected to the European Club. The doctor's face<br>could not accurately be said to flush, but it grew several shades<br>blacker in his anger. Flory was so astonished that he remained<br>standing up.<br><br>'The cunning old devil! Who'd have thought he had it in him? But<br>how did you manage to find all this out?'<br><br>'Ah, I have a few friends left. But now do you see, my friend,<br>what ruin he iss preparing for me? Already he hass calumniated me<br>right and left. When this absurd rebellion breaks out, he will do<br>everything in his power to connect my name with it. And I tell you<br>that the slightest suspicion of my loyalty could be ruin for me,<br>ruin! If it were ever breathed that I were even a sympathizer with<br>this rebellion, there iss an end of me.'<br><br>'But, damn it, this is ridiculous! Surely you can defend yourself<br>somehow?'<br><br>'How can I defend myself when I can prove nothing? I know that all<br>this iss true, but what use iss that? If I demand a public<br>inquiry, for every witness I produce U Po Kyin would produce fifty.<br>You do not realize the influence of that man in the district. No<br>one dare speak against him.'<br><br>'But why need you prove anything? Why not go to old Macgregor and<br>tell him about it? He's a very fair-minded old chap in his way.<br>He'd hear you out.'<br><br>'Useless, useless. You have not the mind of an intriguer, Mr<br>Flory. Qui s'excuse, s'accuse, iss it not? It does not pay to cry<br>that there iss a conspiracy against one.'<br><br>'Well, what are you going to do, then?'<br><br>'There iss nothing I can do. Simply I must wait and hope that my<br>prestige will carry me through. In affairs like this, where a<br>native official's reputation iss at stake, there iss no question<br>of proof, of evidence. All depends upon one's standing with the<br>Europeans. If my standing iss good, they will not believe it of<br>me; if bad, they will believe it. Prestige iss all.'<br><br>They were silent for a moment. Flory understood well enough that<br>'prestige iss all'. He was used to these nebulous conflicts, in<br>which suspicion counts for more than proof, and reputation for more<br>than a thousand witnesses. A thought came into his head, an<br>uncomfortable, chilling thought which would never have occurred to<br>him three weeks earlier. It was one of those moments when one sees<br>quite clearly what is one's duty, and, with all the will in the<br>world to shirk it, feels certain that one must carry it out. He<br>said:<br><br>'Suppose, for instance, you were elected to the Club? Would that<br>do your prestige any good?'<br><br>'If I were elected to the Club! Ah, indeed, yes! The Club! It<br>iss a fortress impregnable. Once there, and no one would listen to<br>these tales about me any more than if it were about you, or Mr<br>Macgregor, or any other European gentleman. But what hope have I<br>that they will elect me after their minds have been poisoned<br>against me?'<br><br>'Well now, look here, doctor, I tell you what. I'll propose your<br>name at the next general meeting. I know the question's got to<br>come up then, and if someone comes forward with the name of a<br>candidate, I dare say no one except Ellis will blackball him.<br>And in the meantime--'<br><br>'Ah, my friend, my dear friend!' The doctor's emotion caused him<br>almost to choke. He seized Flory by the hand. 'Ah, my friend,<br>that iss noble! Truly it iss noble! But it iss too much. I fear<br>that you will be in trouble with your European friends again. Mr<br>Ellis, for example--would he tolerate it that you propose my name?'<br><br>'Oh, bother Ellis. But you must understand that I can't promise to<br>get you elected. It depends on what Macgregor says and what mood<br>the others are in. It may all come to nothing.'<br><br>The doctor was still holding Flory's hand between his own, which<br>were plump and damp. The tears had actually started into his eyes,<br>and these, magnified by his spectacles, beamed upon Flory like the<br>liquid eyes of a dog.<br><br>'Ah, my friend! If I should but be elected! What an end to all my<br>troubles! But, my friend, ass I said before, do not be too rash in<br>this matter. Beware of U Po Kyin! By now he will have numbered<br>you among hiss enemies. And even for you hiss enmity can be a<br>danger.'<br><br>'Oh, good Lord, he can't touch me. He's done nothing so far--only<br>a few silly anonymous letters.'<br><br>'I would not be too sure. He hass subtle ways to strike. And for<br>sure he will raise heaven and earth to keep me from being elected<br>to the Club. If you have a weak spot, guard it, my friend. He<br>will find it out. He strikes always at the weakest spot.'<br><br>'Like the crocodile,' Flory suggested.<br><br>'Like the crocodile,' agreed the doctor gravely. 'Ah but, my<br>friend, how gratifying to me if I should become a member of your<br>European Club! What an honour, to be the associate of European<br>gentlemen! But there iss one other matter, Mr Flory, that I did<br>not care to mention before. It iss--I hope this iss clearly<br>understood--that I have no intention of USING the Club in any way.<br>Membership is all I desire. Even if I were elected, I should not,<br>of course, ever presume to COME to the Club.'<br><br>'Not come to the Club?'<br><br>'No, no! Heaven forbid that I should force my society upon the<br>European gentlemen! Simply I should pay my subscriptions. That,<br>for me, iss a privilege high enough. You understand that, I<br>trust?'<br><br>'Perfectly, doctor, perfectly.'<br><br>Flory could not help laughing as he walked up the hill. He was<br>definitely committed now to proposing the doctor's election. And<br>there would be such a row when the others heard of it--oh, such a<br>devil of a row! But the astonishing thing was that it only made<br>him laugh. The prospect that would have appalled him a month back<br>now almost exhilarated him.<br><br>Why? And why had he given his promise at all? It was a small<br>thing, a small risk to take--nothing heroic about it--and yet it<br>was unlike him. Why, after all these years--the circumspect, pukka<br>sahib-like years--break all the rules so suddenly?<br><br>He knew why. It was because Elizabeth, by coming into his life,<br>had so changed it and renewed it that all the dirty, miserable<br>years might never have passed. Her presence had changed the whole<br>orbit of his mind. She had brought back to him the air of England--<br>dear England, where thought is free and one is not condemned<br>forever to dance the danse du pukka sahib for the edification of<br>the lower races. Where is the life that late I led? he thought.<br>Just by existing she had made it possible for him, she had even<br>made it natural to him, to act decently.<br><br>Where is the life that late I led? he thought again as he came<br>through the garden gate. He was happy, happy. For he had<br>perceived that the pious ones are right when they say that there is<br>salvation and life can begin anew. He came up the path, and it<br>seemed to him that his house, his flowers, his servants, all the<br>life that so short a time ago had been drenched in ennui and<br>homesickness, were somehow made new, significant, beautiful<br>inexhaustibly. What fun it could all be, if only you had someone<br>to share it with you! How you could love this country, if only you<br>were not alone! Nero was out on the path, braving the sun for some<br>grains of paddy that the mali had dropped, taking food to his<br>goats. Flo made a dash at him, panting, and Nero sprang into the<br>air with a flurry and lighted on Flory's shoulder. Flory walked<br>into the house with the little red cock in his arms, stroking his<br>silky ruff and the smooth, diamond-shaped feathers of his back.<br><br>He had not set foot on the veranda before he knew that Ma Hla May<br>was in the house. It did not need Ko S'la to come hurrying from<br>within with a face of evil tidings. Flory had smelled her scent of<br>sandalwood, garlic, coco-nut oil and the jasmine in her hair. He<br>dropped Nero over the veranda rail.<br><br>'THE WOMAN has come back,' said Ko S'la.<br><br>Flory had turned very pale. When he turned pale the birthmark made<br>him hideously ugly. A pang like a blade of ice had gone through<br>his entrails. Ma Hla May had appeared in the doorway of the<br>bedroom. She stood with her face downcast, looking at him from<br>beneath lowered brows.<br><br>'Thakin,' she said in a low voice, half sullen, half urgent.<br><br>'Go away!' said Flory angrily to Ko S'la, venting his fear and<br>anger upon him.<br><br>'Thakin,' she said, 'come into the bedroom here. I have a thing to<br>say to you.'<br><br>He followed her into the bedroom. In a week--it was only a week--<br>her appearance had degenerated extraordinarily. Her hair looked<br>greasy. All her lockets were gone, and she was wearing a<br>Manchester longyi of flowered cotton, costing two rupees eight<br>annas. She had coated her face so thick with powder that it was<br>like a clown's mask, and at the roots of her hair, where the powder<br>ended, there was a ribbon of natural-coloured brown skin. She<br>looked a drab. Flory would not face her, but stood looking<br>sullenly through the open doorway to the veranda.<br><br>'What do you mean by coming back like this? Why did you not go<br>home to your village?'<br><br>'I am staying in Kyauktada, at my cousin's house. How can I go<br>back to my village after what has happened?'<br><br>'And what do you mean by sending men to demand money from me? How<br>can you want more money already, when I gave you a hundred rupees<br>only a week ago?'<br><br>'How can I go back?' she repeated, ignoring what he had said. Her<br>voice rose so sharply that he turned round. She was standing very<br>upright, sullen, with her black brows drawn together and her lips<br>pouted.<br><br>'Why cannot you go back?'<br><br>'After that! After what you have done to me!'<br><br>Suddenly she burst into a furious tirade. Her voice had risen to<br>the hysterical graceless scream of the bazaar women when they<br>quarrel.<br><br>'How can I go back, to be jeered at and pointed at by those low,<br>stupid peasants whom I despise? I who have been a bo-kadaw, a<br>white man's wife, to go home to my father's house, and shake the<br>paddy basket with old hags and women who are too ugly to find<br>husbands! Ah, what shame, what shame! Two years I was your wife,<br>you loved me and cared for me, and then without warning, without<br>reason, you drove me from your door like a dog. And I must go back<br>to my village, with no money, with all my jewels and silk longyis<br>gone, and the people will point and say, "There is Ma Hla May who<br>thought herself cleverer than the rest of us. And behold! her<br>white man has treated her as they always do." I am ruined, ruined!<br>What man will marry me after I have lived two years in your house?<br>You have taken my youth from me. Ah, what shame, what shame!'<br><br>He could not look at her; he stood helpless, pale, hang-dog. Every<br>word she said was justified, and how tell her that he could do no<br>other than he had done? How tell her that it would have been an<br>outrage, a sin, to continue as her lover? He almost cringed from<br>her, and the birthmark stood on his yellow face like a splash of<br>ink. He said flatly, turning instinctively to money--for money had<br>never failed with Ma Hla May:<br><br>'I will give you money. You shall have the fifty rupees you asked<br>me for--more later. I have no more till next month.'<br><br>This was true. The hundred rupees he had given her, and what he<br>had spent on clothes, had taken most of his ready money. To his<br>dismay she burst into a loud wail. Her white mask puckered up and<br>the tears sprang quickly out and coursed down her cheeks. Before<br>he could stop her she had fallen on her knees in front of him, and<br>she was bowing, touching the floor with her forehead in the 'full'<br>shiko of utter abasement.<br><br>'Get up, get up!' he exclaimed. The shameful, abject shiko, neck<br>bent, body doubled up as though inviting a blow, always horrified<br>him. 'I can't bear that. Get up this instant.'<br><br>She wailed again, and made an attempt to clasp his ankles. He<br>stepped backwards hurriedly.<br><br>'Get up, now, and stop that dreadful noise. I don't know what you<br>are crying about.'<br><br>She did not get up, but only rose to her knees and wailed at him<br>anew. 'Why do you offer me money? Do you think it is only for<br>money that I have come back? Do you think that when you have<br>driven me from your door like a dog it is only because of money<br>that I care?'<br><br>'Get up,' he repeated. He had moved several paces away, lest she<br>should seize him. 'What do you want if it is not money?'<br><br>'Why do you hate me?' she wailed. 'What harm have I done you? I<br>stole your cigarette-case, but you were not angry at that. You are<br>going to marry this white woman, I know it, everyone knows it. But<br>what does it matter, why must you turn me away? Why do you hate<br>me?'<br><br>'I don't hate you. I can't explain. Get up, please get up.'<br><br>She was weeping quite shamelessly now. After all, she was hardly<br>more than a child. She looked at him through her tears, anxiously,<br>studying him for a sign of mercy. Then, a dreadful thing, she<br>stretched herself at full length, flat on her face.<br><br>'Get up, get up!' he cried out in English. 'I can't bear that--<br>it's too abominable!'<br><br>She did not get up, but crept, wormlike, right across the floor to<br>his feet. Her body made a broad ribbon on the dusty floor. She<br>lay prostrate in front of him, face hidden, arms extended, as<br>though before a god's altar.<br><br>'Master, master,' she whimpered, 'will you not forgive me? This<br>once, only this once! Take Ma Hla May back. I will be your slave,<br>lower than your slave. Anything sooner than turn me away.'<br><br>She had wound her arms round his ankles, actually was kissing his<br>toes. He stood looking down at her with his hands in his pockets,<br>helpless. Flo came ambling into the room, walked to where Ma Hla<br>May lay and sniffed at her longyi. She wagged her tail vaguely,<br>recognizing the smell. Flory could not endure it. He bent down<br>and took Ma Hla May by the shoulders, lifting her to her knees.<br><br>'Stand up, now,' he said. 'It hurts me to see you like this. I<br>will do what I can for you. What is the use of crying?'<br><br>Instantly she cried out in renewed hope: 'Then you will take me<br>back? Oh, master, take Ma Hla May back! No one need ever know. I<br>will stay here when that white woman comes, she will think I am one<br>of the servants' wives. Will you not take me back?'<br><br>'I cannot. It's impossible,' he said, turning away again.<br><br>She heard finality in his tone, and uttered a harsh, ugly cry. She<br>bent forward again in a shiko, beating her forehead against the<br>floor. It was dreadful. And what was more dreadful than all, what<br>hurt in his breast, was the utter gracelessness, the lowness of the<br>emotion beneath those entreaties. For in all this there was not a<br>spark of love for him. If she wept and grovelled it was only for<br>the position she had once had as his mistress, the idle life, the<br>rich clothes and dominion over servants. There was something<br>pitiful beyond words in that. Had she loved him he could have<br>driven her from his door with far less compunction. No sorrows are<br>so bitter as those that are without a trace of nobility. He bent<br>down and picked her up in his arms.<br><br>'Listen, Ma Hla May,' he said; 'I do not hate you, you have done me<br>no evil. It is I who have wronged you. But there is no help for<br>it now. You must go home, and later I will send you money. If you<br>like you shall start a shop in the bazaar. You are young. This<br>will not matter to you when you have money and can find yourself a<br>husband.'<br><br>'I am ruined!' she wailed again. 'I shall kill myself. I shall<br>jump off the jetty into the river. How can I live after this<br>disgrace?'<br><br>He was holding her in his arms, almost caressing her. She was<br>clinging close to him, her face hidden against his shirt, her body<br>shaking with sobs. The scent of sandalwood floated into his<br>nostrils. Perhaps even now she thought that with her arms around<br>him and her body against his she could renew her power over him.<br>He disentangled himself gently, and then, seeing that she did not<br>fall on her knees again, stood apart from her.<br><br>'That is enough. You must go now. And look, I will give you the<br>fifty rupees I promised you.'<br><br>He dragged his tin uniform case from under the bed and took out<br>five ten-rupee notes. She stowed them silently in the bosom of her<br>ingyi. Her tears had ceased flowing quite suddenly. Without<br>speaking she went into the bathroom for a moment, and came out with<br>her face washed to its natural brown, and her hair and dress<br>rearranged. She looked sullen, but not hysterical any longer.<br><br>'For the last time, thakin: you will not take me back? That is<br>your last word?'<br><br>'Yes. I cannot help it.'<br><br>'Then I am going, thakin.'<br><br>'Very well. God go with you.'<br><br>Leaning against the wooden pillar of the veranda, he watched her<br>walk down the path in the strong sunlight. She walked very<br>upright, with bitter offence in the carriage of her back and head.<br>It was true what she had said, he had robbed her of her youth. His<br>knees were trembling uncontrollably. Ko S'la came behind him,<br>silent-footed. He gave a little deprecating cough to attract<br>Flory's attention.<br><br>'What's the matter now?'<br><br>'The holy one's breakfast is getting cold.'<br><br>'I don't want any breakfast. Get me something to drink--gin.'<br><br>Where is the life that late I led? <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/11.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/13.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
