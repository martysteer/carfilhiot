<h2>Chapter 22</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Maxwell's death had caused a profound shock in Kyauktada. It would<br>cause a shock throughout the whole of Burma, and the case--'the<br>Kyauktada case, do you remember?'--would still be talked of years<br>after the wretched youth's name was forgotten. But in a purely<br>personal way no one was much distressed. Maxwell had been almost a<br>nonentity--just a 'good fellow' like any other of the ten thousand<br>ex colore good fellows of Burma--and with no close friends. No one<br>among the Europeans genuinely mourned for him. But that is not to<br>say that they were not angry. On the contrary, for the moment they<br>were almost mad with rage. For the unforgivable had happened--A<br>WHITE MAN had been killed. When that happens, a sort of shudder<br>runs through the English of the East. Eight hundred people,<br>possibly, are murdered every year in Burma; they matter nothing;<br>but the murder of A WHITE MAN is a monstrosity, a sacrilege. Poor<br>Maxwell would be avenged, that was certain. But only a servant or<br>two, and the Forest Ranger who had brought in his body and who had<br>been fond of him, shed any tears for his death.<br><br>On the other hand, no one was actually pleased, except U Po Kyin.<br><br>'This is a positive gift from heaven!' he told Ma Kin. 'I could<br>not have arranged it better myself. The one thing I needed to make<br>them take my rebellion seriously was a little bloodshed. And here<br>it is! I tell you, Ma Kin, every day I grow more certain that some<br>higher power is working on my behalf.'<br><br>'Ko Po Kyin, truly you are without shame! I do not know how you<br>dare to say such things. Do you not shudder to have murder upon<br>your soul?'<br><br>'What! I? Murder upon my soul? What are you talking about? I<br>have never killed so much as a chicken in my life.'<br><br>'But you are profiting by this poor boy's death.'<br><br>'Profiting by it! Of course I am profiting by it! And why not,<br>indeed? Am I to blame if somebody else choose to commit murder?<br>The fisherman catches fish, and he is damned for it. But are we<br>damned for eating the fish? Certainly not. Why NOT eat the fish,<br>once it is dead? You should study the Scriptures more carefully,<br>my dear Kin Kin.'<br><br>The funeral took place next morning, before breakfast. All the<br>Europeans were present, except Verrall, who was careering about the<br>maidan quite as usual, almost opposite the cemetery. Mr Macgregor<br>read the burial service. The little group of Englishmen stood<br>round the grave, their topis in their hands, sweating into the dark<br>suits that they had dug out from the bottom of their boxes. The<br>harsh morning light beat without mercy upon their faces, yellower<br>than ever against the ugly, shabby clothes. Every face except<br>Elizabeth's looked lined and old. Dr Veraswami and half a dozen<br>other Orientals were present, but they kept themselves decently in<br>the background. There were sixteen gravestones in the little<br>cemetery; assistants of timber firms, officials, soldiers killed in<br>forgotten skirmishes.<br><br>'Sacred to the memory of John Henry Spagnall, late of the Indian<br>Imperial Police, who was cut down by cholera while in the unremitting<br>exercise of' etc., etc., etc.<br><br>Flory remembered Spagnall dimly. He had died very suddenly in camp<br>after his second go of delirium tremens. In a corner there were<br>some graves of Eurasians, with wooden crosses. The creeping<br>jasmine, with tiny orange-hearted flowers, had overgrown<br>everything. Among the jasmine, large rat-holes led down into the<br>graves.<br><br>Mr Macgregor concluded the burial service in a ripe, reverent<br>voice, and led the way out of the cemetery, holding his grey topi--<br>the Eastern equivalent of a top hat--against his stomach. Flory<br>lingered by the gate, hoping that Elizabeth would speak to him, but<br>she passed him without a glance. Everyone had shunned him this<br>morning. He was in disgrace; the murder had made his disloyalty of<br>last night seem somehow horrible. Ellis had caught Westfield by<br>the arm, and they halted at the grave-side, taking out their<br>cigarette-cases. Flory could hear their slangy voices coming<br>across the open grave.<br><br>'My God, Westfield, my God, when I think of that poor little b--<br>lying down there--oh, my God, how my blood does boil! I couldn't<br>sleep all night, I was so furious.'<br><br>'Pretty bloody, I grant. Never mind, promise you a couple of chaps<br>shall swing for it. Two corpses against their one--best we can<br>do.'<br><br>'Two! It ought to be fifty! We've got to raise heaven and hell to<br>get these fellows hanged. Have you got their names yet?'<br><br>'Yes, rather!! Whole blooming district knows who did it. We<br>always do know who's done it in these cases. Getting the bloody<br>villagers to talk--that's the only trouble.'<br><br>'Well, for God's sake get them to talk this time. Never mind the<br>bloody law. Whack it out of them. Torture them--anything. If you<br>want to bribe any witnesses, I'm good for a couple of hundred<br>chips.'<br><br>Westfield sighed. 'Can't do that sort of thing, I'm afraid. Wish<br>we could. My chaps'd know how to put the screw on a witness if you<br>gave 'em the word. Tie 'em down on an ant-hill. Red peppers. But<br>that won't do nowadays. Got to keep our own bloody silly laws.<br>But never mind, those fellows'll swing all right. We've got all<br>the evidence we want.'<br><br>'Good! And when you've arrested them, if you aren't sure of<br>getting a conviction, shoot them, jolly well shoot them! Fake up<br>an escape or something. Anything sooner than let those b--s go<br>free.'<br><br>'They won't go free, don't you fear. We'll get 'em. Get SOMEBODY,<br>anyhow. Much better hang wrong fellow than no fellow,' he added,<br>unconsciously quoting.<br><br>'That's the stuff! I'll never sleep easy again till I've seen them<br>swinging,' said Ellis as they moved away from the grave. 'Christ!<br>Let's get out of this sun! I'm about perishing with thirst.'<br><br>Everyone was perishing, more or less, but it seemed hardly decent<br>to go down to the Club for drinks immediately after the funeral.<br>The Europeans scattered for their houses, while four sweepers with<br>mamooties flung the grey, cement-like earth back into the grave,<br>and shaped it into a rough mound.<br><br>After breakfast, Ellis was walking down to his office, cane in<br>hand. It was blinding hot. Ellis had bathed and changed back into<br>shirt and shorts, but wearing a thick suit even for an hour had<br>brought on his prickly heat abominably. Westfield had gone out<br>already, in his motor launch, with an inspector and half a dozen<br>men, to arrest the murderers. He had ordered Verrall to accompany<br>him--not that Verrall was needed, but, as Westfield said, it would<br>do the young swab good to have a spot of work.<br><br>Ellis wriggled his shoulders--his prickly heat was almost beyond<br>bearing. The rage was stewing in his body like a bitter juice. He<br>had brooded all night over what had happened. They had killed a<br>white man, killed A WHITE MAN, the bloody sods, the sneaking,<br>cowardly hounds! Oh, the swine, the swine, how they ought to be<br>made to suffer for it! Why did we make these cursed kid-glove laws?<br>Why did we take everything lying down? Just suppose this had<br>happened in a German colony, before the War! The good old Germans!<br>They knew how to treat the niggers. Reprisals! Rhinoceros hide<br>whips! Raid their villages, kill their cattle, burn their crops,<br>decimate them, blow them from the guns.<br><br>Ellis gazed into the horrible cascades of light that poured through<br>the gaps in the trees. His greenish eyes were large and mournful.<br>A mild, middle-aged Burman came by, balancing a huge bamboo, which<br>he shifted from one shoulder to the other with a grunt as he passed<br>Ellis. Ellis's grip tightened on his stick. If that swine, now,<br>would only attack you! Or even insult you--anything, so that you<br>had the right to smash him! If only these gutless curs would ever<br>show fight in any conceivable way! Instead of just sneaking past<br>you, keeping within the law so that you never had a chance to get<br>back at them. Ah, for a real rebellion--martial law proclaimed and<br>no quarter given! Lovely, sanguinary images moved through his<br>mind. Shrieking mounds of natives, soldiers slaughtering them.<br>Shoot them, ride them down, horses' hooves trample their guts out,<br>whips cut their faces in slices!<br><br>Five High School boys came down the road abreast. Ellis saw them<br>coming, a row of yellow, malicious faces--epicene faces, horribly<br>smooth and young, grinning at him with deliberate insolence. It<br>was in their minds to bait him, as a white man. Probably they had<br>heard of the murder, and--being Nationalists, like all schoolboys--<br>regarded it as a victory. They grinned full in Ellis's face as<br>they passed him. They were trying openly to provoke him, and they<br>knew that the law was on their side. Ellis felt his breast swell.<br>The look of their faces, jeering at him like a row of yellow<br>images, was maddening. He stopped short.<br><br>'Here! What are you laughing at, you young ticks?'<br><br>The boys turned.<br><br>'I said what the bloody hell are you laughing at?'<br><br>One of the boys answered, insolently--but perhaps his bad English<br>made him seem more insolent than he intended.<br><br>'Not your business.'<br><br>There was about a second during which Ellis did not know what he<br>was doing. In that second he had hit out with all his strength,<br>and the cane landed, crack! right across the boy's eyes. The boy<br>recoiled with a shriek, and in the same instant the other four had<br>thrown themselves upon Ellis. But he was too strong for them. He<br>flung them aside and sprang back, lashing out with his stick so<br>furiously that none of them dared come near.<br><br>'Keep your distance, you --s! Keep off, or by God I'll smash<br>another of you!' Though they were four to one he was so formidable<br>that they surged back in fright. The boy who was hurt had fallen<br>on his knees with his arms across his face, and was screaming 'I am<br>blinded! I am blinded!' Suddenly the other four turned and darted<br>for a pile of laterite, used for road-mending, which was twenty<br>yards away. One of Ellis's clerks had appeared on the veranda of<br>the office and was leaping up and down in agitation.<br><br>'Come up, sir come up at once. They will murder you!'<br><br>Ellis disdained to run, but he moved for the veranda steps. A lump<br>of laterite came sailing through the air and shattered itself<br>against a pillar, whereat the clerk scooted indoors. But Ellis<br>turned on the veranda to face the boys, who were below, each<br>carrying an armful of laterite. He was cackling with delight.<br><br>'You damned, dirty little niggers!' he shouted down at them. 'You<br>got a surprise that time, didn't you? Come up on this veranda and<br>fight me, all four of you! You daren't. Four to one and you<br>daren't face me! Do you call yourselves men? You sneaking, mangy<br>little rats!'<br><br>He broke into Burmese, calling them the incestuous children of<br>pigs. All the while they were pelting him with lumps of laterite,<br>but their arms were feeble and they threw ineptly. He dodged the<br>stones, and as each one missed him he cackled in triumph.<br>Presently there was a sound of shouts up the road, for the noise<br>had been heard at the police station, and some constables were<br>emerging to see what was the matter. The boys took fright and<br>bolted, leaving Ellis a complete victor.<br><br>Ellis had heartily enjoyed the affray, but he was furiously angry<br>as soon as it was over. He wrote a violent note to Mr Macgregor,<br>telling him that he had been wantonly assaulted and demanding<br>vengeance. Two clerks who had witnessed the scene, and a chaprassi,<br>were sent along to Mr Macgregor's office to corroborate the story.<br>They lied in perfect unison. 'The boys had attacked Mr Ellis<br>without any provocation whatever, he had defended himself,' etc.,<br>etc. Ellis, to do him justice, probably believed this to be a<br>truthful version of the story. Mr Macgregor was somewhat disturbed,<br>and ordered the police to find the four schoolboys and interrogate<br>them. The boys, however, had been expecting something of the kind,<br>and were lying very low; the police searched the bazaar all day<br>without finding them. In the evening the wounded boy was taken to<br>a Burmese doctor, who, by applying some poisonous concoction of<br>crushed leaves to his left eye, succeeded in blinding him.<br><br>The Europeans met at the Club as usual that evening, except for<br>Westfield and Verrall, who had not yet returned. Everyone was in a<br>bad mood. Coming on top of the murder, the unprovoked attack on<br>Ellis (for that was the accepted description of it) had scared them<br>as well as angered them. Mrs Lackersteen was twittering to the<br>tune of 'We shall all be murdered in our beds'. Mr Macgregor, to<br>reassure her, told her in cases of riot the European ladies were<br>always locked inside the jail until everything was over; but she<br>did not seem much comforted. Ellis was offensive to Flory, and<br>Elizabeth cut him almost dead. He had come down to the Club in the<br>insane hope of making up their quarrel, and her demeanour made him<br>so miserable that for the greater part of the evening he skulked in<br>the library. It was not till eight o'clock when everyone had<br>swallowed a number of drinks, that the atmosphere grew a little<br>more friendly, and Ellis said:<br><br>'What about sending a couple of chokras up to our houses and<br>getting our dinners sent down here? We might as well have a few<br>rubbers of bridge. Better than mooning about at home.'<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen, who was in dread of going home, jumped at the<br>suggestion. The Europeans occasionally dined at the Club when they<br>wanted to stay late. Two of the chokras were sent for, and on<br>being told what was wanted of them, immediately burst into tears.<br>It appeared that if they went up the hill they were certain of<br>encountering Maxwell's ghost. The mali was sent instead. As the<br>man set out Flory noticed that it was again the night of the full<br>moon--four weeks to a day since that evening, now unutterably<br>remote, when he had kissed Elizabeth under the frangipani tree.<br><br>They had just sat down at the bridge table, and Mrs Lackersteen had<br>just revoked out of pure nervousness, when there was a heavy thump<br>on the roof. Everyone started and look up.<br><br>'A coco-nut falling!' said Mr Macgregor.<br><br>'There aren't any coco-nut trees here,' said Ellis.<br><br>The next moment a number of things happened all together. There<br>was another and much louder bang, one of the petrol lamps broke<br>from its hook and crashed to the ground, narrowly missing Mr<br>Lackersteen, who jumped aside with a yelp, Mrs Lackersteen began<br>screaming, and the butler rushed into the room, bareheaded, his<br>face the colour of bad coffee.<br><br>'Sir, sir! Bad men come! Going to murder us all, sir!'<br><br>'What? Bad men? What do you mean?'<br><br>'Sir, all the villagers are outside! Big stick and dah in their<br>hands, and all dancing about! Going to cut master's throat, sir!'<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen threw herself backwards in her chair. She was<br>setting up such a din of screams as to drown the butler's voice.<br><br>'Oh, be quiet!' said Ellis sharply, turning on her. 'Listen, all<br>of you! Listen to that!'<br><br>There was a deep, murmurous, dangerous sound outside, like the<br>humming of an angry giant. Mr Macgregor, who had stood up,<br>stiffened as he heard it, and settled his spectacles pugnaciously<br>on his nose.<br><br>'This is some kind of disturbance! Butler, pick that lamp up.<br>Miss Lackersteen, look to your aunt. See if she is hurt. The rest<br>of you come with me!'<br><br>They all made for the front door, which someone, presumably the<br>butler, had closed. A fusillade of small pebbles was rattling<br>against it like hail. Mr Lackersteen wavered at the sound and<br>retreated behind the others.<br><br>'I say, dammit, bolt that bloody door, someone!' he said.<br><br>'No, no!' said Mr Macgregor. 'We must go outside. It's fatal not<br>to face them!'<br><br>He opened the door and presented himself boldly at the top of the<br>steps. There were about twenty Burmans on the path, with dahs or<br>sticks in their hands. Outside the fence, stretching up the road<br>in either direction and far out on to the maidan, was an enormous<br>crowd of people. It was like a sea of people, two thousand at the<br>least, black and white in the moon, with here and there a curved<br>dah glittering. Ellis had coolly placed himself beside Mr<br>Macgregor, with his hands in his pockets. Mr Lackersteen had<br>disappeared.<br><br>Mr Macgregor raised his hand for silence. 'What is the meaning of<br>this?' he shouted sternly.<br><br>There were yells, and some lumps of laterite the size of cricket<br>balls came sailing from the road, but fortunately hit no one. One<br>of the men on the path turned and waved his arms to the others,<br>shouting that they were not to begin throwing yet. Then he stepped<br>forward to address the Europeans. He was a strong debonair fellow<br>of about thirty, with down-curving moustaches, wearing a singlet,<br>with his longyi kilted to the knee.<br><br>'What is the meaning of this?' Mr Macgregor repeated.<br><br>The man spoke up with a cheerful grin, and not very insolently.<br><br>'We have no quarrel with you, min gyi. We have come for the timber<br>merchant, Ellis.' (He pronounced it Ellit.) 'The boy whom he<br>struck this morning has gone blind. You must send Ellit out to us<br>here, so that we can punish him. The rest of you will not be<br>hurt.'<br><br>'Just remember that fellow's face,' said Ellis over his shoulder to<br>Flory. 'We'll get him seven years for this afterwards.'<br><br>Mr Macgregor had turned temporarily quite purple. His rage was so<br>great that it almost choked him. For several moments he could not<br>speak, and when he did so it was in English.<br><br>'Whom do you think you are speaking to? In twenty years I have<br>never heard such insolence! Go away this instant, or I shall call<br>out the Military Police!'<br><br>'You'd better be quick, min gyi. We know that there is no justice<br>for us in your courts, so we must punish Ellit ourselves. Send him<br>out to us here. Otherwise, all of you will weep for it.'<br><br>Mr Macgregor made a furious motion with his fist, as though<br>hammering in a nail, 'Go away, son of a dog!' he cried, using his<br>first oath in many years.<br><br>There was a thunderous roar from the road, and such a shower of<br>stones, that everyone was hit, including the Burmans on the path.<br>One stone took Mr Macgregor full in the face, almost knocking him<br>down. The Europeans bolted hastily inside and barred the door. Mr<br>Macgregor's spectacles were smashed and his nose streaming blood.<br>They got back to the lounge to find Mrs Lackersteen looping about<br>in one of the long chairs like a hysterical snake, Mr Lackersteen<br>standing irresolutely in the middle of the room, holding an empty<br>bottle, the butler on his knees in the corner, crossing himself (he<br>was a Roman Catholic), the chokras crying, and only Elizabeth calm,<br>though she was very pale.<br><br>'What's happened?' she exclaimed.<br><br>'We're in the soup, that's what's happened!' said Ellis angrily,<br>feeling at the back of his neck where a stone had hit him. 'The<br>Burmans are all round, shying rocks. But keep calm! They haven't<br>the guts to break the doors in.'<br><br>'Call out the police at once!' said Mr Macgregor indistinctly, for<br>he was stanching his nose with his handkerchief.<br><br>'Can't!' said Ellis. 'I was looking round while you were talking<br>to them. They've cut us off, rot their damned souls! No one could<br>possibly get to the police lines. Veraswami's compound is full of<br>men.'<br><br>'Then we must wait. We can trust them to turn out of their own<br>accord. Calm yourself, my dear Mrs Lackersteen, PLEASE calm<br>yourself! The danger is very small.'<br><br>It did not sound small. There were no gaps in the noise now, and<br>the Burmans seemed to be pouring into the compounds by hundreds.<br>The din swelled suddenly to such a volume that no one could make<br>himself heard except by shouting. All the windows in the lounge<br>had been shut, and some perforated zinc shutters within, which were<br>sometimes used for keeping out insects, pulled to and bolted.<br>There was a series of crashes as the windows were broken, and then<br>a ceaseless thudding of stones from all sides, that shook the thin<br>wooden walls and seemed likely to split them. Ellis opened a<br>shutter and flung a bottle viciously among the crowd, but a dozen<br>stones came hurtling in and he had to close the shutter hurriedly.<br>The Burmans seemed to have no plan beyond flinging stones, yelling<br>and hammering at the walls, but the mere volume of noise was<br>unnerving. The Europeans were half dazed by it at first. None of<br>them thought to blame Ellis, the sole cause of this affair; their<br>common peril seemed, indeed, to draw them closer together for the<br>while. Mr Macgregor, half-blind without his spectacles, stood<br>distractedly in the middle of the room, yielding his right hand to<br>Mrs Lackersteen, who was caressing it, while a weeping chokra clung<br>to his left leg. Mr Lackersteen had vanished again. Ellis was<br>stamping furiously up and down, shaking his fist in the direction<br>of the police lines.<br><br>'Where are the police, the f-- cowardly sods?' he yelled, heedless<br>of the women. 'Why don't they turn out? My God, we won't get<br>another chance like this in a hundred years! If we'd only ten<br>rifles here, how we could slosh these b--s!'<br><br>'They'll be here presently!' Mr Macgregor shouted back. 'It will<br>take them some minutes to penetrate that crowd.'<br><br>'But why don't they use their rifles, the miserable sons of<br>bitches? They could slaughter them in bloody heaps if they'd only<br>open fire. Oh, God, to think of missing a chance like this!'<br><br>A lump of rock burst one of the zinc shutters. Another followed<br>through the hole it had made, stove in a 'Bonzo' picture, bounced<br>off, cut Elizabeth's elbow, and finally landed on the table. There<br>was a roar of triumph from outside, and then a succession of<br>tremendous thumps on the roof. Some children had climbed into the<br>trees and were having the time of their lives sliding down the roof<br>on their bottoms. Mrs Lackersteen outdid all previous efforts with<br>a shriek that rose easily above the din outside.<br><br>'Choke that bloody hag, somebody!' cried Ellis. 'Anyone'd think a<br>pig was being killed. We've got to do something. Flory, Macgregor,<br>come here! Think of a way out of this mess, someone!'<br><br>Elizabeth had suddenly lost her nerve and begun crying. The blow<br>from the stone had hurt her. To Flory's astonishment, he found her<br>clinging tightly to his arm. Even in that moment it made his heart<br>turn over. He had been watching the scene almost with detachment--<br>dazed by the noise, indeed, but not much frightened. He always<br>found it difficult to believe Orientals could be really dangerous.<br>Only when he felt Elizabeth's hand on his arm did he grasp the<br>seriousness of the situation.<br><br>'Oh, Mr Flory, please, please think of something! You can, you<br>can! Anything sooner than let those dreadful men get in here!'<br><br>'If only one of us could get to the police lines!' groaned Mr<br>Macgregor. 'A British officer to lead them! At the worst I must<br>try and go myself.'<br><br>'Don't be a fool! Only get your throat cut!' yelled Ellis. '_I_'ll<br>go if they really look like breaking in. But, oh, to be killed by<br>swine like that! How furious it'd make me! And to think we could<br>murder the whole bloody crowd if only we could get the police<br>here!'<br><br>'Couldn't someone get along the river bank?' Flory shouted<br>despairingly.<br><br>'Hopeless! Hundreds of them prowling up and down. We're cut off--<br>Burmans on three sides and the river on the other!'<br><br>'The river!'<br><br>One of those startling ideas that are overlooked simply because<br>they are so obvious had sprung into Flory's mind.<br><br>'The river! Of course! We can get to the police lines as easy as<br>winking. Don't you see?'<br><br>'How?'<br><br>'Why, down the river--in the water! Swim!'<br><br>'Oh, good man!' cried Ellis, and smacked Flory on the shoulder.<br>Elizabeth squeezed his arm and actually danced a step or two in<br>glee. 'I'll go if you like!' Ellis shouted, but Flory shook his<br>head. He had already begun slipping his shoes off. There was<br>obviously no time to be lost. The Burmans had behaved like fools<br>hitherto, but there was no saying what might happen if they<br>succeeded in breaking in. The butler, who had got over his first<br>fright, prepared to open the window that gave on the lawn, and<br>glanced obliquely out. There were barely a score of Burmans on the<br>lawn. They had left the back of the Club unguarded, supposing that<br>the river cut off retreat.<br><br>'Rush down the lawn like hell!' Ellis shouted in Flory's ear.<br>'They'll scatter all right when they see you.'<br><br>'Order the police to open fire at once!' shouted Mr Macgregor from<br>the other side. 'You have my authority.'<br><br>'And tell them to aim low! No firing over their heads. Shoot to<br>kill. In the guts for choice!'<br><br>Flory leapt down from the veranda, hurting his feet on the hard<br>earth, and was at the river bank in six paces. As Ellis had said,<br>the Burmans recoiled for a moment when they saw him leaping down.<br>A few stones followed him, but no one pursued--they thought, no<br>doubt, that he was only attempting to escape, and in the clear<br>moonlight they could see that it was not Ellis. In another moment<br>he had pushed his way through the bushes and was in the water.<br><br>He sank deep down, and the horrible river ooze received him,<br>sucking him knee-deep so that it was several seconds before he<br>could free himself. When he came to the surface a tepid froth,<br>like the froth on stout, was lapping round his lips, and some<br>spongy thing had floated into his throat and was choking him. It<br>was a sprig of water hyacinth. He managed to spit it out, and<br>found that the swift current had floated him twenty yards already.<br>Burmans were rushing rather aimlessly up and down the bank,<br>yelling. With his eye at the level of the water, Flory could not<br>see the crowd besieging the Club; but he could hear their deep,<br>devilish roaring, which sounded even louder than it had sounded on<br>shore. By the time he was opposite the Military Police lines the<br>bank seemed almost bare of men. He managed to struggle out of the<br>current and flounder through the mud, which sucked off his left<br>sock. A little way down the bank two old men were sitting beside a<br>fence, sharpening fence-posts, as though there had not been a riot<br>within a hundred miles of them. Flory crawled ashore, clambered<br>over the fence and ran heavily across the moonwhite parade-ground,<br>his wet trousers sagging. As far as he could tell in the noise,<br>the lines were quite empty. In some stalls over to the right<br>Verrall's horses were plunging about in a panic. Flory ran out on<br>to the road, and saw what had happened.<br><br>The whole body of policemen, military and civil, about a hundred<br>and fifty men in all, had attacked the crowd from the rear, armed<br>only with sticks. They had been utterly engulfed. The crowd was<br>so dense that it was like an enormous swarm of bees seething and<br>rotating. Everywhere one could see policemen wedged helplessly<br>among the hordes of Burmans, struggling furiously but uselessly,<br>and too cramped even to use their sticks. Whole knots of men were<br>tangled Laocoon-like in the folds of unrolled pagris. There was a<br>terrific bellowing of oaths in three or four languages, clouds of<br>dust, and a suffocating stench of sweat and marigolds--but no one<br>seemed to have been seriously hurt. Probably the Burmans had not<br>used their daks for fear of provoking rifle-fire. Flory pushed his<br>way into the crowd and was immediately swallowed up like the<br>others. A sea of bodies closed in upon him and flung him from side<br>to side, bumping his ribs and choking him with their animal heat.<br>He struggled onwards with an almost dreamlike feeling, so absurd<br>and unreal was the situation. The whole riot had been ludicrous<br>from the start, and what was most ludicrous of all was that the<br>Burmans, who might have killed him, did not know what to do with<br>him now he was among them. Some yelled insults in his face, some<br>jostled him and stamped on his feet, some even tried to make way<br>for him, as a white man. He was not certain whether he was<br>fighting for his life, or merely pushing his way through the crowd.<br>For quite a long time he was jammed, helpless, with his arms pinned<br>against his sides, then he found himself wrestling with a stumpy<br>Burman much stronger than himself, then a dozen men rolled against<br>him like a wave and drove him deeper into the heart of the crowd.<br>Suddenly he felt an agonizing pain in his right big toe--someone in<br>boots had trodden on it. It was the Military Police subahdar, a<br>Rajput, very fat, moustachioed, with his pagri gone. He was<br>grasping a Burman by the throat and trying to hammer his face,<br>while the sweat rolled off his bare, bald crown. Flory threw his<br>arm round the subahdar's neck and managed to tear him away from his<br>adversary and shout in his ear. His Urdu deserted him, and he<br>bellowed in Burmese:<br><br>'Why did you not open fire?'<br><br>For a long time he could not hear the man's answer. Then he caught<br>it:<br><br>'Hukm ne aya'--'I have had no order!'<br><br>'Idiot!'<br><br>At this moment another bunch of men drove against them, and for a<br>minute or two they were pinned and quite unable to move. Flory<br>realized that the subabdar had a whistle in his pocket and was<br>trying to get at it. Finally he got it loose and blew piercing<br>blasts, but there was no hope of rallying any men until they could<br>get into a clear space. It was a fearful labour to struggle our of<br>the crowd--it was like wading neck-deep through a viscous sea. At<br>times the exhaustion of Flory's limbs was so complete that he stood<br>passive, letting the crowd hold him and even drive him backwards.<br>At last, more from the natural eddying of the crowd than by his own<br>effort, he found himself flung out into the open. The subahdar had<br>also emerged, ten or fifteen sepoys, and a Burmese Inspector of<br>Police. Most of the sepoys collapsed on their haunches almost<br>falling with fatigue, and limping, their feet having been trampled<br>on.<br><br>'Come on, get up! Run like hell for the lines! Get some rifles<br>and a clip of ammunition each.'<br><br>He was too overcome even to speak in Burmese, but the men understood<br>him and lopped heavily towards the police lines. Flory followed<br>them, to get away from the crowd before they turned on him again.<br>When he reached the gate the sepoys were returning with their rifles<br>and already preparing to fire.<br><br>'The sahib will give the order!' the subahdar panted.<br><br>'Here you!' cried Flory to the Inspector. 'Can you speak<br>Hindustani?'<br><br>'Yes, sir.'<br><br>'Then tell them to fire high, right over the people's heads. And<br>above all, to fire all together. Make them understand that.'<br><br>The fat Inspector, whose Hindustani was even worse than Flory's,<br>explained what was wanted, chiefly by leaping up and down and<br>gesticulating. The sepoys raised their rifles, there was a roar,<br>and a rolling echo from the hillside. For a moment Flory thought<br>that his order had been disregarded, for almost the entire section<br>of the crowd nearest them had fallen like a swath of hay. However,<br>they had only flung themselves down in panic. The sepoys fired a<br>second volley, but it was not needed. The crowd had immediately<br>begun to surge outwards from the Club like a river changing its<br>course. They came pouring down the road, saw the armed men barring<br>their way, and tried to recoil, whereupon there was a fresh battle<br>between those in front and those behind; finally the whole crowd<br>bulged outwards and began to roll slowly up the maidan. Flory and<br>the sepoys moved slowly towards the Club on the heels of the<br>retreating crowd. The policemen who had been engulfed were<br>straggling back by ones and twos. Their pagris were gone and their<br>puttees trailing yards behind them, but they had no damage worse<br>than bruises. The Civil Policemen were dragging a very few<br>prisoners among them. When they reached the Club compound the<br>Burmans were still pouring out, an endless line of young men<br>leaping gracefully through a gap in the hedge like a procession of<br>gazelles. It seemed to Flory that it was getting very dark. A<br>small white-clad figure extricated itself from the last of the<br>crowd and tumbled limply into Flory's arms. It was Dr Veraswami,<br>with his tie torn off but his spectacles miraculously unbroken.<br><br>'Doctor!'<br><br>'Ach, my friend! Ach, how I am exhausted!'<br><br>'What are you doing here? Were you right in the middle of that<br>crowd?'<br><br>'I was trying to restrain them, my friend. It was hopeless until<br>you came. But there is at least one man who bears the mark of<br>this, I think!'<br><br>He held out a small fist for Flory to see the damaged knuckles.<br>But it was certainly quite dark now. At the same moment Flory<br>heard a nasal voice behind him.<br><br>'Well, Mr Flory, so it's all over already! A mere flash in the pan<br>as usual. You and I together were a little too much for them--<br>ha, ha!'<br><br>It was U Po Kyin. He came towards them with a martial air,<br>carrying a huge stick, and with a revolver thrust into his belt.<br>His dress was a studious negligee--singlet and Shan trousers--to<br>give the impression that he had rushed out of his house post-haste.<br>He had been lying low until the danger should be over, and was now<br>hurrying forth to grab a share of any credit that might be going.<br><br>'A smart piece of work, sir!' he said enthusiastically. 'Look how<br>they are flying up the hillside! We have routed them most<br>satisfactory.'<br><br>'WE!' panted the doctor indignantly.<br><br>'Ah, my dear doctor! I did not perceive that you were there. It<br>is possible that YOU also have been in the fighting? YOU--risking<br>your most valuable life! Who would have believed such a thing?'<br><br>'You've taken your time getting here yourself!' said Flory angrily.<br><br>'Well, well sir, it is enough that we have dispersed them.<br>Although,' he added with a touch of satisfaction, for he had<br>noticed Flory's tone, 'they are going in the direction of the<br>European houses, you will observe. I fancy that it will occur to<br>them to do a little plundering on their way.'<br><br>One had to admire the man's impudence. He tucked his great stick<br>under his arm and strolled beside Flory in an almost patronizing<br>manner, while the doctor dropped behind, abashed in spite of<br>himself. At the Club gate all three men halted. It was now<br>extraordinarily dark, and the moon had vanished. Low overhead,<br>just visible, black clouds were streaming eastward like a pack of<br>hounds. A wind, almost cold, blew down the hillside and swept a<br>cloud of dust and fine water-vapour before it. There was a sudden<br>intensely rich scent of damp. The wind quickened, the trees<br>rustled, then began beating themselves furiously together, the big<br>frangipani tree by the tennis court flinging out a nebula of dimly<br>seen blossom. All three men turned and hurried for shelter, the<br>Orientals to their houses, Flory to the Club. It had begun<br>raining. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/20.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/22.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
