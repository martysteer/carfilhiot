<h2>Chapter 23</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Next day the town was quieter than a cathedral city on Monday<br>morning. It is usually the case after a riot. Except for the<br>handful of prisoners, everyone who could possibly have been<br>concerned in the attack on the Club had a watertight alibi. The<br>Club garden looked as though a herd of bison had stampeded across<br>it, but the houses had not been plundered, and there were no new<br>casualties among the Europeans, except that after everything was<br>over Mr Lackersteen had been found very drunk under the billiard-<br>table, where he had retired with a bottle of whisky. Westfield and<br>Verrall came back early in the morning, bringing Maxwell's<br>murderers under arrest; or at any rate, bringing two people who<br>would presently be hanged for Maxwell's murder. Westfield, when he<br>heard the news of the riot, was gloomy but resigned. AGAIN it<br>happened--a veritable riot, and he not there to quell it! It<br>seemed fated that he should never kill a man. Depressing,<br>depressing. Verrall's only comment was that it had been 'damned<br>lip' on the part of Flory (a civilian) to give orders to the<br>Military Police.<br><br>Meanwhile, it was raining almost without cease. As soon as he woke<br>up and heard the rain hammering on the roof Flory dressed and<br>hurried out, Flo following. Out of sight of the houses he took off<br>his clothes and let the rain sluice down on his bare body. To his<br>surprise, he found that he was covered with bruises from last<br>night; but the rain had washed away every trace of his prickly heat<br>within three minutes. It is wonderful, the healing power of<br>rainwater. Flory walked down to Dr Veraswami's house, with his<br>shoes squelching and periodical jets of water flowing down his neck<br>from the brim of his Terai hat. The sky was leaden, and<br>innumerable whirling storms chased one another across the maidan<br>like squadrons of cavalry. Burmans passed, under vast wooden hats<br>in spite of which their bodies streamed water like the bronze gods<br>in the fountains. A network of rivulets was already washing the<br>stones of the road bare. The doctor had just got home when Flory<br>arrived, and was shaking a wet umbrella over the veranda rail. He<br>hailed Flory excitedly.<br><br>'Come up, Mr Flory, come up at once! You are just apropos. I was<br>on the point of opening a bottle of Old Tommy Gin. Come up and let<br>me drink to your health, ass the saviour of Kyauktada!'<br><br>They had a long talk together. The doctor was in a triumphant<br>mood. It appeared that what had happened last night had righted<br>his troubles almost miraculously. U Po Kyin's schemes were undone.<br>The doctor was no longer at his mercy--in fact, it was the other<br>way about. The doctor explained to Flory:<br><br>'You see, my friend, this riot--or rather, your most noble<br>behaviour in it--wass quite outside U Po Kyin's programme. He had<br>started the SO-CALLED rebellion and had the glory of crushing it,<br>and he calculated that any further outbreak would simply mean more<br>glory still. I am told that when he heard of Mr Maxwell's death,<br>hiss joy was positively'--the doctor nipped his thumb and forefinger<br>together--'what iss the word I want?'<br><br>'Obscene?'<br><br>'Ah yes. Obscene. It iss said that actually he attempted to<br>dance--can you imagine such a disgusting spectacle?--and exclaimed,<br>"Now at least they will take my rebellion seriously!" Such iss his<br>regard for human life. But now hiss triumph iss at an end. The<br>riot hass tripped up in mid-career.'<br><br>'How?'<br><br>'Because, do you not see, the honours of the riot are not hiss, but<br>yours! And I am known to be your friend. I stand, so to speak, in<br>the reflection of your glory. Are you not the hero of the hour?<br>Did not your European friends receive you with open arms when you<br>returned to the Club last night?'<br><br>'They did, I must admit. It was quite a new experience for me.<br>Mrs Lackersteen was all over me. "DEAR Mr Flory", she calls me now.<br>And she's got her knife properly in Ellis. She hasn't forgotten<br>that he called her a bloody hag and told her to stop squealing like<br>a pig.'<br><br>'Ah, Mr Ellis iss sometimes over-emphatic in hiss expressions. I<br>have noticed it.'<br><br>'The only fly in the ointment is that I told the police to fire<br>over the crowd's heads instead of straight at them. It seems<br>that's against all the Government regulations. Ellis was a little<br>vexed about it. "Why didn't you plug some of the b--s when you had<br>the chance?" he said. I pointed out that it would have meant<br>hitting the police who were in the middle of the crowd; but as he<br>said, they were only niggers anyway. However, all my sins are<br>forgiven me. And Macgregor quoted something in Latin--Horace, I<br>believe.'<br><br>It was half an hour later when Flory walked along to the Club. He<br>had promised to see Mr Macgregor and settle the business of the<br>doctor's election. But there would be no difficulty about it now.<br>The others would eat out of his hand until the absurd riot was<br>forgotten; he could have gone into the Club and made a speech in<br>favour of Lenin, and they would have put up with it. The lovely<br>rain streamed down, drenching him from head to foot, and filling<br>his nostrils with the scent of earth, forgotten during the bitter<br>months of drought. He walked up the wrecked garden, where the<br>mali, bending down with the rain splashing on his bare back, was<br>trowelling holes for zinnias. Nearly all the flowers had been<br>trampled out of existence. Elizabeth was there, on the side<br>veranda, almost as though she were waiting for him. He took off<br>his hat, spilling a pool of water from the brim, and went round to<br>join her.<br><br>'Good morning!' he said, raising his voice because of the rain that<br>beat noisily on the low roof.<br><br>'Good morning! ISN'T it coming down? Simply PELTING!'<br><br>'Oh, this isn't real rain. You wait till July. The whole Bay of<br>Bengal is going to pour itself on us, by instalments.'<br><br>It seemed that they must never meet without talking of the weather.<br>Nevertheless, her face said something very different from the banal<br>words. Her demeanour had changed utterly since last night. He<br>took courage.<br><br>'How is the place where that stone hit you?'<br><br>She held her arm out to him and let him take it. Her air was<br>gentle, even submissive. He realized that his exploit of last<br>night had made him almost a hero in her eyes. She could not know<br>how small the danger had really been, and she forgave him<br>everything, even Ma Hla May, because he had shown courage at the<br>right moment. It was the buffalo and the leopard over again. His<br>heart thumped in his breast. He slipped his hand down her arm and<br>clasped her fingers in his own.<br><br>'Elizabeth--'<br><br>'Someone will see us!' she said, and she withdrew her hand, but not<br>angrily.<br><br>'Elizabeth, I've something I want to say to you. Do you remember a<br>letter I wrote you from the jungle, after our--some weeks ago?'<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>'You remember what I said in it?'<br><br>'Yes. I'm sorry I didn't answer it. Only--'<br><br>'I couldn't expect you to answer it, then. But I just wanted to<br>remind you of what I said.'<br><br>In the letter, of course, he had only said, and feebly enough, that<br>he loved her--would always love her, no matter what happened. They<br>were standing face to face, very close together. On an impulse--<br>and it was so swiftly done that afterwards he had difficulty in<br>believing that it had ever happened--he took her in his arms and<br>drew her towards him. For a moment she yielded and let him lift up<br>her face and kiss her; then suddenly she recoiled and shook her<br>head. Perhaps she was frightened that someone would see them,<br>perhaps it was only because his moustache was so wet from the rain.<br>Without saying anything more she broke from him and hurried away<br>into the Club. There was a look of distress or compunction in her<br>face; but she did not seem angry.<br><br>He followed her more slowly into the Club, and ran into Mr<br>Macgregor, who was in a very good humour. As soon as he saw Flory<br>he boomed genially, 'Aha! The conquering hero comes!' and then, in<br>a more serious vein, offered him fresh congratulations. Flory<br>improved the occasion by saying a few words on behalf of the<br>doctor. He painted quite a lively picture of the doctor's heroism<br>in the riot. 'He was right in the middle of the crowd, fighting<br>like a tiger,' etc., etc. It was not too much exaggerated--for the<br>doctor had certainly risked his life. Mr Macgregor was impressed,<br>and so were the others when they heard of it. At all times the<br>testimony of one European can do an Oriental more good than that of<br>a thousand of his fellow countrymen; and at this moment Flory's<br>opinion carried weight. Practically, the doctor's good name was<br>restored. His election to the Club could be taken as assured.<br><br>However, it was not finally agreed upon yet, because Flory was<br>returning to camp. He set out the same evening, marching by night,<br>and he did not see Elizabeth again before leaving. It was quite<br>safe to travel in the jungle now, for the futile rebellion was<br>obviously finished. There is seldom any talk of rebellion after<br>the rains have started--the Burmans are too busy ploughing, and in<br>any case the waterlogged fields are impassable for large bodies of<br>men. Flory was to return to Kyauktada in ten days, when the<br>padre's six-weekly visit fell due. The truth was that he did not<br>care to be in Kyauktada while both Elizabeth and Verrall were<br>there. And yet, it was strange, but all the bitterness--all the<br>obscene, crawling envy that had tormented him before--was gone now<br>that he knew she had forgiven him. It was only Verrall who stood<br>between them now. And even the thought of her in Verrall's arms<br>could hardly move him, because he knew that at the worst the affair<br>must have an end. Verrall, it was quite certain, would never marry<br>Elizabeth; young men of Verrall's stamp do not marry penniless<br>girls met casually at obscure Indian stations. He was only amusing<br>himself with Elizabeth. Presently he would desert her, and she<br>would return to him--to Flory. It was enough--it was far better<br>than he had hoped. There is a humility about genuine love that is<br>rather horrible in some ways.<br><br>U Po Kyin was furiously angry. The miserable riot had taken him<br>unawares, so far as anything ever took him unawares, and it was<br>like a handful of grit thrown into the machinery of his plans. The<br>business of disgracing the doctor had got to be begun all over<br>again. Begun it was, sure enough, with such a spate of anonymous<br>letters that Hla Pe had to absent himself from office for two whole<br>days--it was bronchitis this time--to get them written. The doctor<br>was accused of every crime from pederasty to stealing Government<br>postage stamps. The prison warder who had let Nga Shwe O escape<br>had now come up for trial. He was triumphantly acquitted, U Po<br>Kyin having spent as much as two hundred rupees in bribing the<br>witnesses. More letters showered up on Mr Macgregor, proving in<br>detail that Dr Veraswami, the real author of the escape, had tried<br>to shift the blame on to a helpless subordinate. Nevertheless, the<br>results were disappointing. The confidential letter which Mr<br>Macgregor wrote to the Commissioner, reporting on the riot, was<br>steamed open, and its tone was so alarming--Mr Macgregor had spoken<br>of the doctor as 'behaving most creditably' on the night of the<br>riot--that U Po Kyin called a council of war.<br><br>'The time has come for a vigorous move,' he said to the others--<br>they were in conclave on the front veranda, before breakfast. Ma<br>Kin was there, and Ba Sein and Hla Pe--the latter a bright-faced,<br>promising boy of eighteen, with the manner of one who will<br>certainly succeed in life.<br><br>'We are hammering against a brick wall,' U Po Kyin continued; 'and<br>that wall is Flory. Who could have foreseen that that miserable<br>coward would stand by his friend? However, there it is. So long<br>as Veraswami has his backing, we are helpless.'<br><br>'I have been talking to the Club butler, sir,' said Ba Sein. 'He<br>tells me that Mr Ellis and Mr Westfield still do not want the<br>doctor to be elected to the Club. Do you not think they will<br>quarrel with Flory again as soon as this business of the riot is<br>forgotten?'<br><br>'Of course they will quarrel, they always quarrel. But in the<br>meantime the harm is done. Just suppose that man WERE elected! I<br>believe I should die of rage if it happened. No, there is only one<br>move left. We must strike at Flory himself!'<br><br>'At Flory, sir! But he is a white man!'<br><br>'What do I care? I have ruined white men before now. Once let<br>Flory be disgraced, and there is an end of the doctor. And he<br>shall be disgraced! I will shame him so that he will never dare<br>show his face in that Club again!'<br><br>'But, sir! A white man! What are we to accuse him of? Who would<br>believe anything against a white man?'<br><br>'You have no strategy, Ko Ba Sein. One does not ACCUSE a white<br>man; one has got to catch him in the act. Public disgrace, in<br>flagrante delicto. I shall know how to set about it. Now be<br>silent while I think.'<br><br>There was a pause. U Po Kyin stood gazing out into the rain with<br>his small hands clasped behind him and resting on the natural<br>plateau of his posterior. The other three watched him from the end<br>of the veranda, almost frightened by this talk of attacking a white<br>man, and waiting for some masterstroke to cope with a situation<br>that was beyond them. It was a little like the familiar picture<br>(is it Meissonier's?) of Napoleon at Moscow, poring over his maps<br>while his marshals wait in silence, with their cocked hats in their<br>hands. But of course U Po Kyin was more equal to the situation<br>than Napoleon. His plan was ready within two minutes. When he<br>turned round his vast face was suffused with excessive joy. The<br>doctor had been mistaken when he described U Po Kyin as attempting<br>to dance; U Po Kyin's figure was not designed for dancing; but, had<br>it been so designed, he would have danced at this moment. He<br>beckoned to Ba Sein and whispered in his ear for a few seconds.<br><br>'That is the correct move, I think?' he concluded.<br><br>A broad, unwilling, incredulous grin stole slowly across Ba Sein's<br>face.<br><br>'Fifty rupees ought to cover all the expenses,' added U Po Kyin,<br>beaming.<br><br>The plan was unfolded in detail. And when the others had taken it<br>in, all of them, even Ba Sein, who seldom laughed, even Ma Kin, who<br>disapproved from the bottom of her soul, burst into irrepressible<br>peals of laughter. The plan was really too good to be resisted.<br>It was genius.<br><br>All the while it was raining, raining. The day after Flory went<br>back to camp it rained for thirty-eight hours at a stretch,<br>sometimes slowing to the pace of English rain, sometimes pouring<br>down in such cataracts that one thought the whole ocean must by now<br>have been sucked up into the clouds. The rattling on the roof<br>became maddening after a few hours. In the intervals between the<br>rain the sun glared as fiercely as ever, the mud began to crack and<br>steam, and patches of prickly heat sprang out all over one's body.<br>Hordes of flying beetles had emerged from their cocoons as soon as<br>the rain started; there was a plague of loathly creatures known as<br>stink-bugs, which invaded the houses in incredible numbers,<br>littered themselves over the dining-table and made one's food<br>uneatable. Verrall and Elizabeth still went out riding in the<br>evenings, when the rain was not too fierce. To Verrall, all<br>climates were alike, but he did not like to see his ponies<br>plastered with mud. Nearly a week went by. Nothing was changed<br>between them--they were neither less nor more intimate than they<br>had been before. The proposal of marriage, still confidently<br>expected, was still unuttered. Then an alarming thing happened.<br>The news filtered to the Club, through Mr Macgregor, that Verrall<br>was leaving Kyauktada; the Military Police were to be kept at<br>Kyauktada, but another officer was coming in Verrall's place, no<br>one was certain when. Elizabeth was in horrible suspense. Surely,<br>if he was going away, he must say something definite soon? She<br>could not question him--dared not even ask him whether he was<br>really going; she could only wait for him to speak. He said<br>nothing. Then one evening, without warning, he failed to turn up<br>at the Club. And two whole days passed during which Elizabeth did<br>not see him at all.<br><br>It was dreadful, but there was nothing that could be done. Verrall<br>and Elizabeth had been inseparable for weeks, and yet in a way they<br>were almost strangers. He had kept himself so aloof from them all--<br>had never even seen the inside of the Lackersteens' house. They<br>did not know him well enough to seek him out at the dakbungalow, or<br>write to him; nor did he reappear at morning parade on the maidan.<br>There was nothing to do except wait until he chose to present<br>himself again. And when he did, would he ask her to marry him?<br>Surely, surely he must! Both Elizabeth and her aunt (but neither<br>of them had even spoken of it openly) held it as an article of<br>faith that he must ask her. Elizabeth looked forward to their next<br>meeting with a hope that was almost painful. Please God it would<br>be a week at least before he went! If she rode with him four times<br>more, or three times--even if it were only twice, all might yet be<br>well. Please God he would come back to her soon! It was<br>unthinkable that when he came, it would only be to say good-bye!<br>The two women went down to the Club each evening and sat there<br>until quite late, listening for Verrall's footsteps outside while<br>seeming not to listen; but he never appeared. Ellis, who<br>understood the situation perfectly, watched Elizabeth with spiteful<br>amusement. What made it worst of all was that Mr Lackersteen was<br>now pestering Elizabeth unceasingly. He had become quite reckless.<br>Almost under the eyes of the servants he would waylay her, catch<br>hold of her and begin pinching and fondling her in the most<br>revolting way. Her sole defence was to threaten that she would<br>tell her aunt; happily he was too stupid to realize that she would<br>never dare do it.<br><br>On the third morning Elizabeth and her aunt arrived at the Club<br>just in time to escape a violent storm of rain. They had been<br>sitting in the lounge for a few minutes when they heard the sound<br>of someone stamping the water off his shoes in the passage. Each<br>woman's heart stirred, for this might be Verrall. Then a young man<br>entered the lounge, unbuttoning a long raincoat as he came. He was<br>a stout, rollicking, chuckle-headed youth of about twenty-five,<br>with fat fresh cheeks, butter-coloured hair, no forehead, and, as<br>it turned out afterwards, a deafening laugh.<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen made some inarticulate sound--it was jerked out of<br>her by her disappointment. The youth, however, hailed them with<br>immediate bonhomie, being one of those who are on terms of slangy<br>intimacy with everyone from the moment of meeting them.<br><br>'Hullo, hullo!' he said 'Enter the fairy prince! Hope I don't sort<br>of intrude and all that? Not shoving in on any family gatherings<br>or anything?'<br><br>'Not at all!' said Mrs Lackersteen in surprise.<br><br>'What I mean to say--thought I'd just pop in at the Club and have<br>a glance round, don't you know. Just to get acclimatized to the<br>local brand of whisky. I only got here last night.'<br><br>'Are you STATIONED here?' said Mrs Lackersteen, mystified--for they<br>had not been expecting any newcomers.<br><br>'Yes, rather. Pleasure's mine, entirely.'<br><br>'But we hadn't heard. . . . Oh, of course! I suppose you're from<br>the Forest Department? In place of poor Mr Maxwell?'<br><br>'What? Forest Department? No fear! I'm the new Military Police<br>bloke, you know.'<br><br>'The--what?'<br><br>'New Military Police bloke. Taking over from dear ole Verrall.<br>The dear ole chap got orders to go back to his regiment. Going off<br>in a fearful hurry. And a nice mess he's left everything in for<br>yours truly, too.'<br><br>The Military Policeman was a crass youth, but even he noticed that<br>Elizabeth's face turned suddenly sickly. She found herself quite<br>unable to speak. It was several seconds before Mrs Lackersteen<br>managed to exclaim:<br><br>'Mr Verrall--going? Surely he isn't going away YET?'<br><br>'Going? He's gone!'<br><br>'GONE?'<br><br>'Well, what I mean to say--train's due to start in about half an<br>hour. He'll be along at the station now. I sent a fatigue party<br>to look after him. Got to get his ponies aboard and all that.'<br><br>There were probably further explanations, but neither Elizabeth nor<br>her aunt heard a word of them. In any case, without even a good-<br>bye to the Military Policeman, they were out on the front steps<br>within fifteen seconds. Mrs Lackersteen called sharply for the<br>butler.<br><br>'Butler! Send my rickshaw round to the front at once! To the<br>station, jaldi!' she added as the rickshaw-man appeared, and,<br>having settled herself in the rickshaw, poked him in the back with<br>the ferrule of her umbrella to start him.<br><br>Elizabeth had put on her raincoat and Mrs Lackersteen was cowering<br>in the rickshaw behind her umbrella, but neither was much use<br>against the rain. It came driving towards them in such sheets that<br>Elizabeth's frock was soaked before they had reached the gate, and<br>the rickshaw almost overturned in the wind. The rickshaw-wallah<br>put his head down and struggled into it, groaning. Elizabeth was<br>in agony. It was a mistake, SURELY it was a mistake. He had<br>written to her and the letter had gone astray. That was it, that<br>MUST be it! It could not be that he had meant to leave her without<br>even saying good-bye! And if it were so--no, not even then would<br>she give up hope! When he saw her on the platform, for the last<br>time, he could not be so brutal as to forsake her! As they neared<br>the station she fell behind the rickshaw and pinched her cheeks to<br>bring the blood into them. A squad of Military Police sepoys<br>shuffled hurriedly by, their thin uniforms sodden into rags,<br>pushing a handcart among them. Those would be Verrall's fatigue<br>party. Thank God, there was a quarter of an hour yet. The train<br>was not due to leave for another quarter of an hour. Thank God, at<br>least, for this last chance of seeing him!<br><br>They arrived on the platform just in time to see the train draw out<br>of the station and gather speed with a series of deafening snorts.<br>The stationmaster, a little round, black man, was standing on the<br>line looking ruefully after the train, and holding his waterproof-<br>covered topi on to his head with one hand, while with the other he<br>fended off two clamorous Indians who were bobbing at him and trying<br>to thrust something upon his attention. Mrs Lackersteen leaned out<br>of the rickshaw and called agitatedly through the rain.<br><br>'Stationmaster!'<br><br>'Madam!'<br><br>'What train is that?'<br><br>'That is the Mandalay train, madam.'<br><br>'The Mandalay train! It can't be!'<br><br>'But I assure you, madam! It is precisely the Mandalay train.' He<br>came towards them, removing his topi.<br><br>'But Mr Verrall--the Police officer? Surely he's not on it?'<br><br>'Yes, madam, he have departed.' He waved his hand towards the<br>train, now receding rapidly in a cloud of rain and steam.<br><br>'But the train wasn't due to start yet!'<br><br>'No, madam. Not due to start for another ten minutes.'<br><br>'Then why has it gone?'<br><br>The stationmaster waved his topi apologetically from side to side.<br>His dark, squabby face looked quite distressed.<br><br>'I know, madam, I know! MOST unprecedented! But the young Military<br>Police officer have positively COMMANDED me to start the train! He<br>declare that all is ready and he do not wish to be kept waiting.<br>I point out the irregularity. He say he do not care about<br>irregularity. I expostulate. He insist. And in short--'<br><br>He made another gesture. It meant that Verrall was the kind of man<br>who would have his way, even when it came to starting a train ten<br>minutes early. There was a pause. The two Indians, imagining that<br>they saw their chance, suddenly rushed forward, wailing, and<br>offered some grubby notebooks for Mrs Lackersteen's inspection.<br><br>'What DO these men want?' cried Mrs Lackersteen distractedly.<br><br>'They are grass-wallahs, madam. They say that Lieutenant Verrall<br>have departed owing them large sums of money. One for hay, the<br>other for corn. Of mine it is no affair.'<br><br>There was a hoot from the distant train. It rolled round the bend,<br>like a black-behinded caterpillar that looks over its shoulder as<br>it goes, and vanished. The stationmaster's wet white trousers<br>flapped forlornly about his legs. Whether Verrall had started the<br>train early to escape Elizabeth, or to escape the grass-wallahs,<br>was an interesting question that was never cleared up.<br><br>They made their way back along the road, and then struggled up the<br>hill in such a wind that sometimes they were driven several paces<br>backwards. When they gained the veranda they were quite out of<br>breath. The servants took their streaming raincoats, and Elizabeth<br>shook some of the water from her hair. Mrs Lackersteen broke her<br>silence for the first time since they had left the station:<br><br>'WELL! Of all the unmannerly--of the simply ABOMINABLE. . . !'<br><br>Elizabeth looked pale and sickly, in spite of the rain and wind<br>that had beaten into her face. But she would betray nothing.<br><br>'I think he might have waited to say good-bye to us,' she said<br>coldly.<br><br>'Take my word for it, dear, you are thoroughly well rid of him! . . .<br>As I said from the start, a most ODIOUS young man!'<br><br>Some time later, when they were sitting down to breakfast, having<br>bathed and got into dry clothes, and feeling better, she remarked:<br><br>'Let me see, what day is this?'<br><br>'Saturday, Aunt.'<br><br>'Ah, Saturday. Then the dear padre will be arriving this evening.<br>How many shall we be for the service tomorrow? Why, I think we<br>shall ALL be here! How very nice! Mr Flory will be here too. I<br>think he said he was coming back from the jungle tomorrow.' She<br>added almost lovingly, 'DEAR Mr Flory!'<br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/21.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/23.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
