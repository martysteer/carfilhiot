<h2>Chapter 19</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">The heat was growing worse and worse. April was nearly over, but<br>there was no hope of rain for another three weeks, five weeks it<br>might be. Even the lovely transient dawns were spoiled by the<br>thought of the long, blinding hours to come, when one's head would<br>ache and the glare would penetrate through every covering and glue<br>up one's eyelids with restless sleep. No one, Oriental or<br>European, could keep awake in the heat of the day without a<br>struggle; at night, on the other hand, with the howling dogs and<br>the pools of sweat that collected and tormented one's prickly heat,<br>no one could sleep. The mosquitoes at the Club were so bad that<br>sticks of incense had to be kept burning in all the corners, and<br>the women sat with their legs in pillowslips. Only Verrall and<br>Elizabeth were indifferent to the heat. They were young and their<br>blood was fresh, and Verrall was too stoical and Elizabeth too<br>happy to pay any attention to the climate.<br><br>There was much bickering and scandal-mongering at the Club these<br>days. Verrall had put everyone's nose out of joint. He had taken<br>to coming to the Club for an hour or two in the evenings, but he<br>ignored the other members, refused the drinks they offered him, and<br>answered attempts at conversation with surly monosyllables. He<br>would sit under the punkah in the chair that had once been sacred<br>to Mrs Lackersteen, reading such of the papers as interested him,<br>until Elizabeth came, when he would dance and talk with her for an<br>hour or two and then make off without so much as a good-night to<br>anybody. Meanwhile Mr Lackersteen was alone in his camp, and,<br>according to the rumours which drifted back to Kyauktada, consoling<br>loneliness with quite a miscellany of Burmese women.<br><br>Elizabeth and Verrall went out riding together almost every evening<br>now. Verrall's mornings, after parade, were sacred to polo<br>practice, but he had decided that it was worth while giving up the<br>evenings to Elizabeth. She took naturally to riding, just as she<br>had to shooting; she even had the assurance to tell Verrall that<br>she had 'hunted quite a lot' at home. He saw at a glance that she<br>was lying, but at least she did not ride so badly as to be a<br>nuisance to him.<br><br>They used to ride up the red road into the jungle, ford the stream<br>by the big pyinkado tree covered with orchids, and then follow the<br>narrow cart-track, where the dust was soft and the horses could<br>gallop. It was stifling hot in the dusty jungle, and there were<br>always mutterings of faraway, rainless thunder. Small martins<br>flitted round the horses, keeping pace with them, to hawk for the<br>flies their hooves turned up. Elizabeth rode the bay pony, Verrall<br>the white. On the way home they would walk their sweat-dark horses<br>abreast, so close sometimes his knee brushed against hers, and<br>talk. Verrall could drop his offensive manner and talk amicably<br>enough when he chose, and he did choose with Elizabeth.<br><br>Ah, the joy of those rides together! The joy of being on horseback<br>and in the world of horses--the world of hunting and racing, polo<br>and pigsticking! If Elizabeth had loved Verrall for nothing else,<br>she would have loved him for bringing horses into her life. She<br>tormented him to talk about horses as once she had tormented Flory<br>to talk about shooting. Verrall was no talker, it was true. A few<br>gruff, jerky sentences about polo and pigsticking, and a catalogue<br>of Indian stations and the names of regiments, were the best he<br>could do. And yet somehow the little he said could thrill<br>Elizabeth as all Flory's talk had never done. The mere sight of<br>him on horseback was more evocative than any words. An aura of<br>horsemanship and soldiering surrounded him. In his tanned face and<br>his hard, straight body Elizabeth saw all the romance, the splendid<br>panache of a cavalryman's life. She saw the North-West Frontier<br>and the Cavalry Club--she saw the polo grounds and the parched<br>barrack yards, and the brown squadrons of horsemen galloping with<br>their long lances poised and the trains of their pagris streaming;<br>she heard the bugle-calls and the jingle of spurs, and the<br>regimental bands playing outside the messrooms while the officers<br>sat at dinner in their stiff, gorgeous uniforms. How splendid it<br>was, that equestrian world, how splendid! And it was HER world,<br>she belonged to it, she had been born of it. These days, she<br>lived, thought, dreamed horses, almost like Verrall himself. The<br>time came when she not only TOLD her taradiddle about having<br>'hunted quite a lot', she even came near believing it.<br><br>In every possible way they got on so well together. He never bored<br>her and fretted her as Flory had done. (As a matter of fact, she<br>had almost forgotten Flory, these days; when she thought of him, it<br>was for some reason always his birthmark that she remembered.) It<br>was a bond between them that Verrall detested anything 'highbrow'<br>even more than she did. He told her once that he had not read a<br>book since he was eighteen, and that indeed he 'loathed' books;<br>'except, of course, Jorrocks and all that'. On the evening of<br>their third or fourth ride they were parting at the Lackersteens'<br>gate. Verrall had successfully resisted all Mrs Lackersteen's<br>invitations to meals; he had not yet set foot inside the<br>Lackersteens' house, and he did not intend to do so. As the syce<br>was taking Elizabeth's pony, Verrall said:<br><br>'I tell you what. Next time we come out you shall ride Belinda.<br>I'll ride the chestnut. I think you've got on well enough not to<br>go and cut Belinda's mouth up.'<br><br>Belinda was the Arab mare. Verrall had owned her two years, and<br>till this moment he had never once allowed anyone else to mount<br>her, not even the syce. It was the greatest favour that he could<br>imagine. And so perfectly did Elizabeth appreciate Verrall's point<br>of view that she understood the greatness of the favour, and was<br>thankful.<br><br>The next evening, as they rode home side by side, Verrall put his<br>arm round Elizabeth's shoulder, lifted her out of the saddle and<br>pulled her against him. He was very strong. He dropped the<br>bridle, and with his free hand, lifted her face up to meet his;<br>their mouths met. For a moment he held her so, then lowered her to<br>the ground and slipped from his horse. They stood embraced, their<br>thin, drenched shirts pressed together, the two bridles held in the<br>crook of his arm.<br><br>It was about the same time that Flory, twenty miles away, decided<br>to come back to Kyauktada. He was standing at the jungle's edge by<br>the bank of a dried-up stream, where he had walked to tire himself,<br>watching some tiny, nameless finches eating the seeds of the tall<br>grasses. The cocks were chrome-yellow, the hens like hen sparrows.<br>Too tiny to bend the stalks, they came whirring towards them,<br>seized them in midflight and bore them to the ground by their own<br>weight. Flory watched the birds incuriously, and almost hated them<br>because they could light no spark of interest in him. In his<br>idleness he flung his dah at them, scaring them away. If she were<br>here, if she were here! Everything--birds, trees, flowers,<br>everything--was deadly and meaningless because she was not here.<br>As the days passed the knowledge that he had lost her had grown<br>surer and more actual until it poisoned every moment.<br><br>He loitered a little way into the jungle, flicking at creepers with<br>his dah. His limbs felt slack and leaden. He noticed a wild<br>vanilla plant trailing over a bush, and bent down to sniff at its<br>slender, fragrant pods. The scent brought him a feeling of<br>staleness and deadly ennui. Alone, alone, in the sea of life<br>enisled! The pain was so great that he struck his fist against a<br>tree, jarring his arm and splitting two knuckles. He must go back<br>to Kyauktada. It was folly, for barely a fortnight had passed<br>since the scene between them, and his only chance was to give her<br>time to forget it. Still, he must go back. He could not stay any<br>longer in this deadly place, alone with his thoughts among the<br>endless, mindless leaves.<br><br>A happy thought occurred to him. He could take Elizabeth the<br>leopard-skin that was being cured for her in the jail. It would be<br>a pretext for seeing her, and when one comes bearing gifts one is<br>generally listened to. This time he would not let her cut him<br>short without a word. He would explain, extenuate--make her<br>realize that she had been unjust to him. It was not right that she<br>should condemn him because of Ma Hla May, whom he had turned out of<br>doors for Elizabeth's own sake. Surely she must forgive him when<br>she heard the truth of the story? And this time she SHOULD hear<br>it; he would force her to listen to him if he had to hold her by<br>the arms while he did it.<br><br>He went back the same evening. It was a twenty-mile journey, by<br>rutted cart-tracks, but Flory decided to march by night, giving the<br>reason that it was cooler. The servants almost mutinied at the<br>idea of a night-march, and at the very last moment old Sammy<br>collapsed in a semi-genuine fit and had to be plied with gin before<br>he could start. It was a moonless night. They made their way by<br>the light of lanterns, in which Flo's eyes gleamed like emeralds<br>and the bullocks' eyes like moonstones. When the sun was up the<br>servants halted to gather sticks and cook breakfast, but Flory was<br>in a fever to be at Kyauktada, and he hurried ahead. He had no<br>feeling of tiredness. The thought of the leopard-skin had filled<br>him with extravagant hopes. He crossed the glittering river by<br>sampan and went straight to Dr Veraswami's bungalow, getting there<br>about ten.<br><br>The doctor invited him to breakfast, and--having shooed the women<br>into some suitable hiding-place--took him into his own bath-room so<br>that he could wash and shave. At breakfast the doctor was very<br>excited and full of denunciations of 'the crocodile'; for it<br>appeared that the pseudo-rebellion was now on the point of breaking<br>out. It was not till after breakfast that Flory had an opportunity<br>to mention the leopard-skin.<br><br>'Oh, by the way, doctor. What about that skin I sent to the jail<br>to be cured? Is it done yet?'<br><br>'Ah--' said the doctor in a slightly disconcerted manner, rubbing<br>his nose. He went inside the house--they were breakfasting on the<br>veranda, for the doctor's wife had protested violently against<br>Flory being brought indoors--and came back in a moment with the<br>skin rolled up in a bundle.<br><br>'Ass a matter of fact--' he began, unrolling it.<br><br>'Oh, doctor!'<br><br>The skin had been utterly ruined. It was as stiff as cardboard,<br>with the leather cracked and the fur discoloured and even rubbed<br>off in patches. It also stank abominably. Instead of being cured,<br>it had been converted into a piece of rubbish.<br><br>'Oh, doctor! What a mess they've made of it! How the devil did it<br>happen?'<br><br>'I am so sorry, my friend! I wass about to apologize. It wass the<br>best we could do. There iss no one at the jail who knows how to<br>cure skins now.'<br><br>'But, damn it, that convict used to cure them so beautifully!'<br><br>'Ah, yes. But he iss gone from us these three weeks, alas.'<br><br>'Gone? I thought he was doing seven years?'<br><br>'What? Did you not hear, my friend? I thought you knew who it<br>wass that used to cure the skins. It was Nga Shwe O.'<br><br>'Nga Shwe O?'<br><br>'The dacoit who escaped with U Po Kyin's assistance.'<br><br>'Oh, hell!'<br><br>The mishap had daunted him dreadfully. Nevertheless, in the<br>afternoon, having bathed and put on a clean suit, he went up to the<br>Lackersteens' house, at about four. It was very early to call, but<br>he wanted to make sure of catching Elizabeth before she went down<br>to the Club. Mrs Lackersteen, who had been asleep and was not<br>prepared for visitors, received him with an ill grace, not even<br>asking him to sit down.<br><br>'I'm afraid Elizabeth isn't down yet. She's dressing to go out<br>riding. Wouldn't it be better if you left a message?'<br><br>'I'd like to see her, if you don't mind. I've brought her the skin<br>of that leopard we shot together.'<br><br>Mrs Lackersteen left him standing up in the drawing-room, feeling<br>lumpish and abnormally large as one does at such times. However,<br>she fetched Elizabeth, taking the opportunity of whispering to her<br>outside the door: 'Get rid of that dreadful man as soon as you<br>can, dear. I can't bear him about the house at this time of day.'<br><br>As Elizabeth entered the room Flory's heart pounded so violently<br>that a reddish mist passed behind his eyes. She was wearing a silk<br>shirt and jodhpurs, and she was a little sunburned. Even in his<br>memory she had never been so beautiful. He quailed; on the instant<br>he was lost--every scrap of his screwed-up courage had fled.<br>Instead of stepping forward to meet her he actually backed away.<br>There was a fearful crash behind him; he had upset an occasional<br>table and sent a bowl of zinnias hurtling across the floor.<br><br>'I'm so sorry!' he exclaimed in horror.<br><br>'Oh, not at ALL! PLEASE don't worry about it!'<br><br>She helped him to pick up the table, chattering all the while as<br>gaily and easily as though nothing had happened: 'You HAVE been<br>away a long time, Mr Flory! You're quite a STRANGER! We've SO<br>missed you at the Club!' etc., etc. She was italicizing every<br>other word, with that deadly, glittering brightness that a woman<br>puts on when she is dodging a moral obligation. He was terrified<br>of her. He could not even look her in the face. She took up a box<br>of cigarettes and offered him one, but he refused it. His hand was<br>shaking too much to take it.<br><br>'I've brought you that skin,' he said flatly.<br><br>He unrolled it on the table they had just picked up. It looked so<br>shabby and miserable that he wished he had never brought it. She<br>came close to him to examine the skin, so close that her flower-<br>like cheek was not a foot from his own, and he could feel the<br>warmth of her body. So great was his fear of her that he stepped<br>hurriedly away. And in the same moment she too stepped back with a<br>wince of disgust, having caught the foul odour of the skin. It<br>shamed him terribly. It was almost as though it had been himself<br>and not the skin that stank.<br><br>'Thank you EVER so much, Mr Flory!' She had put another yard<br>between herself and the skin. 'Such a LOVELY big skin, isn't it?'<br><br>'It was, but they've spoiled it, I'm afraid.'<br><br>'Oh no! I shall love having it!--Are you back in Kyauktada for<br>long? How dreadfully hot it must have been in camp!'<br><br>'Yes, it's been very hot.'<br><br>For three minutes they actually talked of the weather. He was<br>helpless. All that he had promised himself to say, all his<br>arguments and pleadings, had withered in his throat. 'You fool,<br>you fool,' he thought, 'what are you doing? Did you come twenty<br>miles for this? Go on, say what you came to say! Seize her in<br>your arms; make her listen, kick her, beat her--anything sooner<br>than let her choke you with this drivel!' But it was hopeless,<br>hopeless. Not a word could his tongue utter except futile<br>trivialities. How could he plead or argue, when that bright easy<br>air of hers, that dragged every word to the level of Club-chatter<br>silenced him before he spoke? Where do they learn it, that<br>dreadful tee-heeing brightness? In these brisk modern girls'<br>schools, no doubt. The piece of carrion on the table made him more<br>ashamed every moment. He stood there almost voiceless, lumpishly<br>ugly with his face yellow and creased after the sleepless night,<br>and his birthmark like a smear of dirt.<br><br>She got rid of him after a very few minutes. 'And now, Mr Flory,<br>if you DON'T mind, I ought really--'<br><br>He mumbled rather than said, 'Won't you come out with me again some<br>time? Walking, shooting--something?'<br><br>'I have so LITTLE time nowadays! ALL my evenings seem to be full.<br>This evening I'm going out riding. With Mr Verrall,' she added.<br><br>It was possible that she added that in order to wound him. This<br>was the first that he had heard of her friendship with Verrall. He<br>could not keep the dread, flat tone of envy out of his voice as he<br>said:<br><br>'Do you go out riding much with Verrall?'<br><br>'Almost every evening. He's such a wonderful horseman! And he has<br>absolute STRINGS of polo ponies!'<br><br>'Ah. And of course I have no polo ponies.'<br><br>It was the first thing he had said that even approached seriousness,<br>and it did no more than offend her. However, she answered him with<br>the same gay easy air as before, and then showed him out. Mrs<br>Lackersteen came back to the drawing-room, sniffed the air, and<br>immediately ordered the servants to take the reeking leopard-skin<br>outside and burn it.<br><br>Flory lounged at his garden gate, pretending to feed the pigeons.<br>He could not deny himself the pain of seeing Elizabeth and Verrall<br>start on their ride. How vulgarly, how cruelly she had behaved to<br>him! It is dreadful when people will not even have the decency to<br>quarrel. Presently Verrall rode up to the Lackersteens' house on<br>the white pony, with a syce riding the chestnut, then there was a<br>pause, then they emerged together, Verrall on the chestnut pony,<br>Elizabeth on the white, and trotted quickly up the hill. They were<br>chattering and laughing, her silk-shirted shoulder very close to<br>his. Neither looked towards Flory.<br><br>When they had disappeared into the jungle, Flory still loafed in<br>the garden. The glare was waning to yellow. The mali was at work<br>grubbing up the English flowers, most of which had died, slain by<br>too much sunshine, and planting balsams, cockscombs, and more<br>zinnias. An hour passed, and a melancholy, earth-coloured Indian<br>loitered up the drive, dressed in a loin-cloth and a salmon-pink<br>pagri on which a washing-basket was balanced. He laid down his<br>basket and salaamed to Flory.<br><br>'Who are you?'<br><br>'Book-wallah, sahib.'<br><br>The book-wallah was an itinerant peddler of books who wandered from<br>station to station throughout Upper Burma. His system of exchange<br>was that for any book in his bundle you gave him four annas, and<br>any other book. Not quite ANY book, however, for the book-wallah,<br>though analphabetic, had learned to recognize and refuse a Bible.<br><br>'No, sahib,' he would say plaintively, 'no. This book (he would<br>turn it over disapprovingly in his flat brown hands) this book with<br>a black cover and gold letters--this one I cannot take. I know not<br>how it is, but all sahibs are offering me this book, and none are<br>taking it. What can it be that is in this black book? Some evil,<br>undoubtedly.'<br><br>'Turn out your trash,' Flory said.<br><br>He hunted among them for a good thriller--Edgar Wallace or Agatha<br>Christie or something; anything to still the deadly restlessness<br>that was at his heart. As he bent over the books he saw that both<br>Indians were exclaiming and pointing towards the edge of the<br>jungle.<br><br>'Dekko!' said the mali in his plum-in-the-mouth voice.<br><br>The two ponies were emerging from the jungle. But they were<br>riderless. They came trotting down the hill with the silly guilty<br>air of a horse that has escaped from its master, with the stirrups<br>swinging and clashing under their bellies.<br><br>Flory remained unconsciously clasping one of the books against his<br>chest. Verrall and Elizabeth had dismounted. It was not an<br>accident; by no effort of the mind could one imagine Verrall<br>falling off his horse. They had dismounted, and the ponies had<br>escaped.<br><br>They had dismounted--for what? Ah, but he knew for what! It was<br>not a question of suspecting; he KNEW. He could see the whole<br>thing happening, in one of those hallucinations that are so perfect<br>in detail, so vilely obscene, that they are past bearing. He threw<br>the book violently down and made for the house, leaving the book-<br>wallah disappointed. The servants heard him moving about indoors,<br>and presently he called for a bottle of whisky. He had a drink and<br>it did him no good. Then he filled a tumbler two-thirds full,<br>added enough water to make it drinkable, and swallowed it. The<br>filthy, nauseous dose was no sooner down his throat than he<br>repeated it. He had done the same thing in camp once, years ago,<br>when he was tortured by toothache and three hundred miles from a<br>dentist. At seven Ko S'la came in as usual to say that the bath-<br>water was hot. Flory was lying in one of the long chairs, with his<br>coat off and his shirt torn open at the throat.<br><br>'Your bath, thakin,' said Ko S'la.<br><br>Flory did not answer, and Ko S'la touched his arm, thinking him<br>asleep. Flory was much too drunk to move. The empty bottle had<br>rolled across the floor, leaving a trail of whisky-drops behind it.<br>Ko S'la called for Ba Pe and picked up the bottle, clicking his<br>tongue.<br><br>'Just look at this! He has drunk more than three-quarters of a<br>bottle!'<br><br>'What, again? I thought he had given up drinking?'<br><br>'It is that accursed woman, I suppose. Now we must carry him<br>carefully. You take his heels, I'll take his head. That's right.<br>Hoist him up!'<br><br>They carried Flory into the other room and laid him gently on the<br>bed.<br><br>'Is he really going to marry this "Ingaleikma"?' said Ba Pe.<br><br>'Heaven knows. She is the mistress of the young police officer at<br>present, so I was told. Their ways are not our ways. I think I<br>know what he will be wanting tonight,' he added as he undid Flory's<br>braces--for Ko S'la had the art, so necessary in a bachelor's<br>servant, of undressing his master without waking him.<br><br>The servants were rather more pleased than not to see this return<br>to bachelor habits. Flory woke about midnight, naked in a pool of<br>sweat. His head felt as though some large, sharp-cornered metal<br>object were bumping about inside it. The mosquito net was up, and<br>a young woman was sitting beside the bed fanning him with a wicker<br>fan. She had an agreeable negroid face, bronze-gold in the<br>candlelight. She explained that she was a prostitute, and that Ko<br>S'la had engaged her on his own responsibility for a fee of ten<br>rupees.<br><br>Flory's head was splitting. 'For God's sake get me something to<br>drink,' he said feebly to the woman. She brought him some soda-<br>water which Ko S'la had cooled in readiness and soaked a towel and<br>put a wet compress round his forehead. She was a fat, good-<br>tempered creature. She told him that her name was Ma Sein Galay,<br>and that besides plying her other trade she sold paddy baskets in<br>the bazaar near Li Yeik's shop. Flory's head felt better<br>presently, and he asked for a cigarette; whereupon Ma Sein Galay,<br>having fetched the cigarette, said naively, 'Shall I take my<br>clothes off now, thakin?'<br><br>Why not? he thought dimly. He made room for her in the bed. But<br>when he smelled the familiar scent of garlic and coco-nut oil,<br>something painful happened within him, and with his head pillowed<br>on Ma Sein Galay's fat shoulder he actually wept, a thing he had<br>not done since he was fifteen years old. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/17.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/19.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
