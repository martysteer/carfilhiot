<h2>Chapter 9</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">During the next fortnight a great deal happened.<br><br>The feud between U Po Kyin and Dr Veraswami was now in full swing.<br>The whole town was divided into two factions, with every native<br>soul from the magistrates down to the bazaar sweepers enrolled on<br>one side or the other, and all ready for perjury when the time<br>came. But of the two parties, the doctor's was much the smaller<br>and less efficiently libellous. The editor of the Burmese Patriot<br>had been put on trial for sedition and libel, bail being refused.<br>His arrest had provoked a small riot in Rangoon, which was<br>suppressed by the police with the death of only two rioters. In<br>prison the editor went on hunger strike, but broke down after six<br>hours.<br><br>In Kyauktada, too, things had been happening. A dacoit named Nga<br>Shwe O had escaped from the jail in mysterious circumstances. And<br>there had been a whole crop of rumours about a projected native<br>rising in the district. The rumours--they were very vague ones as<br>yet--centred round a village named Thongwa, not far from the camp<br>where Maxwell was girdling teak. A weiksa, or magician, was said<br>to have appeared from nowhere and to be prophesying the doom of the<br>English power and distributing magic bullet-proof jackets. Mr<br>Macgregor did not take the rumours very seriously, but he had asked<br>for an extra force of Military Police. It was said that a company<br>of Indian infantry with a British officer in command would be sent<br>to Kyauktada shortly. Westfield, of course, had hurried to Thongwa<br>at the first threat, or rather hope, of trouble.<br><br>'God, if they'd only break out and rebel properly for once!' he<br>said to Ellis before starting. 'But it'll be a bloody washout as<br>usual. Always the same story with these rebellions--peter out<br>almost before they've begun. Would you believe it, I've never<br>fired my gun at a fellow yet, not even a dacoit. Eleven years of<br>it, not counting the War, and never killed a man. Depressing.'<br><br>'Oh, well,' said Ellis, 'if they won't come up to the scratch you<br>can always get hold of the ringleaders and give them a good<br>bambooing on the Q.T. That's better than coddling them up in our<br>damned nursing homes of prisons.'<br><br>'H'm, probably. Can't do it though, nowadays. All these kid-glove<br>laws--got to keep them, I suppose, if we're fools enough to make<br>'em.'<br><br>'Oh, rot the laws. Bambooing's the only thing that makes any<br>impression on the Burman. Have you seen them after they've been<br>flogged? I have. Brought out of the jail on bullock carts,<br>yelling, with the women plastering mashed bananas on their<br>backsides. That's something they do understand. If I had my way<br>I'd give it 'em on the soles of the feet the same as the Turks do.'<br><br>'Ah well. Let's hope they'll have the guts to show a bit of fight<br>for once. Then we'll call out the Military Police, rifles and all.<br>Plug a few dozen of 'em--that'll clear the air.'<br><br>However, the hoped-for opportunity did not come. Westfield and the<br>dozen constables he had taken with him to Thongwa--jolly round-<br>faced Gurkha boys, pining to use their kukris on somebody--found<br>the district depressingly peaceful. There seemed not the ghost of<br>a rebellion anywhere; only the annual attempt, as regular as the<br>monsoon, of the villagers to avoid paying the capitation tax.<br><br>The weather was growing hotter and hotter. Elizabeth had had her<br>first attack of prickly heat. Tennis at the Club had practically<br>ceased; people would play one languid set and then fall into chairs<br>and swallow pints of tepid lime-juice--tepid, because the ice came<br>only twice weekly from Mandalay and melted within twenty-four hours<br>of arriving. The Flame of the Forest was in full bloom. The<br>Burmese women, to protect their children from the sun, streaked<br>their faces with yellow cosmetic until they looked like little<br>African witch-doctors. Flocks of green pigeons, and imperial<br>pigeons as large as ducks, came to eat the berries of the big<br>peepul trees along the bazaar road.<br><br>Meanwhile, Flory had turned Ma Hla May out of his house.<br><br>A nasty, dirty job! There was a sufficient pretext--she had stolen<br>his gold cigarette-case and pawned it at the house of Li Yeik, the<br>Chinese grocer and illicit pawnbroker in the bazaar--but still, it<br>was only a pretext. Flory knew perfectly well, and Ma Hla May<br>knew, and all the servants knew, that he was getting rid of her<br>because of Elizabeth. Because of 'the Ingaleikma with dyed hair',<br>as Ma Hla May called her.<br><br>Ma Hla May made no violent scene at first. She stood sullenly<br>listening while he wrote her a cheque for a hundred rupees--Li Yeik<br>or the Indian chetty in the bazaar would cash cheques--and told her<br>that she was dismissed. He was more ashamed than she; he could not<br>look her in the face, and his voice went flat and guilty. When the<br>bullock cart came for her belongings, he shut himself in the<br>bedroom skulking till the scene should be over.<br><br>Cartwheels grated on the drive, there was the sound of men<br>shouting; then suddenly there was a fearful uproar of screams.<br>Flory went outside. They were all struggling round the gate in the<br>sunlight. Ma Hla May was clinging to the gatepost and Ko S'la was<br>trying to bundle her out. She turned a face full of fury and<br>despair towards Flory, screaming over and over, 'Thakin! Thakin!<br>Thakin! Thakin! Thakin!' It hurt him to the heart that she<br>should still call him thakin after he had dismissed her.<br><br>'What is it?' he said.<br><br>It appeared that there was a switch of false hair that Ma Hla May<br>and Ma Yi both claimed. Flory gave the switch to Ma Yi and gave Ma<br>Hla May two rupees to compensate her. Then the cart jolted away,<br>with Ma Hla May sitting beside her two wicker baskets, straight-<br>backed and sullen, and nursing a kitten on her knees. It was only<br>two months since he had given her the kitten as a present.<br><br>Ko S'la, who had long wished for Ma Hla May's removal, was not<br>altogether pleased now that it had happened. He was even less<br>pleased when he saw his master going to church--or as he called it,<br>to the 'English pagoda'--for Flory was still in Kyauktada on the<br>Sunday of the padre's arrival, and he went to church with the<br>others. There was a congregation of twelve, including Mr Francis,<br>Mr Samuel and six native Christians, with Mrs Lackersteen playing<br>'Abide with Me' on the tiny harmonium with one game pedal. It was<br>the first time in ten years that Flory had been to church, except<br>to funerals. Ko S'la's notions of what went on in the 'English<br>pagoda' were vague in the extreme; but he did know that church-<br>going signified respectability--a quality which, like all<br>bachelors' servants, he hated in his bones.<br><br>'There is trouble coming,' he said despondently to the other<br>servants. 'I have been watching him (he meant Flory) these ten<br>days past. He has cut down his cigarettes to fifteen a day, he has<br>stopped drinking gin before breakfast, he shaves himself every<br>evening--though he thinks I do not know it, the fool. And he has<br>ordered half a dozen new silk shirts! I had to stand over the<br>dirzi calling him bahinchut to get them finished in time. Evil<br>omens! I give him three months longer, and then good-bye to the<br>peace in this house!'<br><br>'What, is he going to get married?' said Ba Pe.<br><br>'I am certain of it. When a white man begins going to the English<br>pagoda, it is, as you might say, the beginning of the end.'<br><br>'I have had many masters in my life,' old Sammy said. 'The worst<br>was Colonel Wimpole sahib, who used to make his orderly hold me<br>down over the table while he came running from behind and kicked me<br>with very thick boots for serving banana fritters too frequently.<br>At other times, when he was drunk, he would fire his revolver<br>through the roof of the servants' quarters, just above our heads.<br>But I would sooner serve ten years under Colonel Wimpole sahib than<br>a week under a memsahib with her kit-kit. If our master marries I<br>shall leave the same day.'<br><br>'I shall not leave, for I have been his servant fifteen years. But<br>I know what is in store for us when that woman comes. She will<br>shout at us because of spots of dust on the furniture, and wake us<br>up to bring cups of tea in the afternoon when we are asleep, and<br>come poking into the cookhouse at all hours and complain over dirty<br>saucepans and cockroaches in the flour bin. It is my belief that<br>these women lie awake at nights thinking of new ways to torment<br>their servants.'<br><br>'They keep a little red book,' said Sammy, 'in which they enter the<br>bazaar-money, two annas for this, four annas for that, so that a<br>man cannot earn a pice. They make more kit-kit over the price of<br>an onion than a sahib over five rupees.'<br><br>'Ah, do I not know it! She will be worse than Ma Hla May. Women!'<br>he added comprehensively, with a kind of sigh.<br><br>The sigh was echoed by the others, even by Ma Pu and Ma Yi.<br>Neither took Ko S'la's remarks as a stricture upon her own sex,<br>Englishwomen being considered a race apart, possibly not even<br>human, and so dreadful that an Englishman's marriage is usually the<br>signal for the flight of every servant in his house, even those who<br>have been with him for years. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/7.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/9.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
