<h2>Chapter 4</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Flory lay asleep, naked except for black Shan trousers, upon his<br>sweat-damp bed. He had been idling all day. He spent approximately<br>three weeks of every month in camp, coming into Kyauktada for a few<br>days at a time, chiefly in order to idle, for he had very little<br>clerical work to do.<br><br>The bedroom was a large square room with white plaster walls, open<br>doorways and no ceiling, but only rafters in which sparrows nested.<br>There was no furniture except the big four-poster bed, with its<br>furled mosquito net like a canopy, and a wicker table and chair and<br>a small mirror; also some rough bookshelves, containing several<br>hundred books, all mildewed by many rainy seasons and riddled by<br>silver fish. A tuktoo clung to the wall, flat and motionless like<br>a heraldic dragon. Beyond the veranda eaves the light rained down<br>like glistening white oil. Some doves in a bamboo thicket kept up<br>a dull droning noise, curiously appropriate to the heat--a sleepy<br>sound, but with the sleepiness of chloroform rather than a lullaby.<br><br>Down at Mr Macgregor's bungalow, two hundred yards away, a durwan,<br>like a living clock, hammered four strokes on a section of iron<br>rail. Ko S'la, Flory's servant, awakened by the sound, went into<br>the cookhouse, blew up the embers of the woodfire and boiled the<br>kettle for tea. Then he put on his pink gaungbaung and muslin<br>ingyi and brought the tea-tray to his master's bedside.<br><br>Ko S'la (his real name was Maung San Hla; Ko S'la was an<br>abbreviation) was a short, square-shouldered, rustic-looking Burman<br>with a very dark skin and a harassed expression. He wore a black<br>moustache which curved downwards round his mouth, but like most<br>Burmans he was quite beardless. He had been Flory's servant since<br>his first day in Burma. The two men were within a month of one<br>another's age. They had been boys together, had tramped side by<br>side after snipe and duck, sat together in machans waiting for<br>tigers that never came, shared the discomforts of a thousand camps<br>and marches; and Ko S'la had pimped for Flory and borrowed money<br>for him from the Chinese money-lenders, carried him to bed when he<br>was drunk, tended him through bouts of fever. In Ko S'la's eyes<br>Flory, because a bachelor, was a boy still; whereas Ko S'la had<br>married, begotten five children, married again and become one of<br>the obscure martyrs of bigamy. Like all bachelors' servants, Ko<br>S'la was lazy and dirty, and yet he was devoted to Flory. He would<br>never let anyone else serve Flory at table, or carry his gun or<br>hold his pony's head while he mounted. On the march, if they came<br>to a stream, he would carry Flory across on his back. He was<br>inclined to pity Flory, partly because he thought him childish and<br>easily deceived, and partly because of the birthmark, which he<br>considered a dreadful thing.<br><br>Ko S'la put the tea-tray down on the table very quietly, and then<br>went round to the end of the bed and tickled Flory's toes. He knew<br>by experience that this was the only way of waking Flory without<br>putting him in a bad temper. Flory rolled over, swore, and pressed<br>his forehead into the pillow.<br><br>'Four o'clock has struck, most holy god,' Ko S'la said. 'I have<br>brought two teacups, because THE WOMAN said that she was coming.'<br><br>THE WOMAN was Ma Hla May, Flory's mistress. Ko S'la always called<br>her THE WOMAN, to show his disapproval--not that he disapproved of<br>Flory for keeping a mistress, but he was jealous of Ma Hla May's<br>influence in the house.<br><br>'Will the holy one play tinnis this evening?' Ko S'la asked.<br><br>'No, it's too hot,' said Flory in English. 'I don't want anything<br>to eat. Take this muck away and bring some whisky.'<br><br>Ko S'la understood English very well, though he could not speak it.<br>He brought a bottle of whisky, and also Flory's tennis racquet,<br>which he laid in a meaning manner against the wall opposite the<br>bed. Tennis, according to his notions, was a mysterious ritual<br>incumbent on all Englishmen, and he did not like to see his master<br>idling in the evenings.<br><br>Flory pushed away in disgust the toast and butter that Ko S'la had<br>brought, but he mixed some whisky in a cup of tea and felt better<br>after drinking it. He had slept since noon, and his head and all<br>his bones ached, and there was a taste like burnt paper in his<br>mouth. It was years since he had enjoyed a meal. All European<br>food in Burma is more or less disgusting--the bread is spongy stuff<br>leavened with palm-toddy and tasting like a penny bun gone wrong,<br>the butter comes out of a tin, and so does the milk, unless it is<br>the grey watery catlap of the dudh-wallah. As Ko S'la left the<br>room there was a scraping of sandals outside, and a Burmese girl's<br>high-pitched voice said, 'Is my master awake?'<br><br>'Come in,' said Flory rather bad temperedly.<br><br>Ma Hla May came in, kicking off red-lacquered sandals in the<br>doorway. She was allowed to come to tea, as a special privilege,<br>but not to other meals, nor to wear her sandals in her master's<br>presence.<br><br>Ma Hla May was a woman of twenty-two or -three, and perhaps five<br>feet tall. She was dressed in a longyi of pale blue embroidered<br>Chinese satin, and a starched white muslin ingyi on which several<br>gold lockets hung. Her hair was coiled in a tight black cylinder<br>like ebony, and decorated with jasmine flowers. Her tiny,<br>straight, slender body was a contourless as a bas-relief carved<br>upon a tree. She was like a doll, with her oval, still face the<br>colour of new copper, and her narrow eyes; an outlandish doll and<br>yet a grotesquely beautiful one. A scent of sandalwood and coco-<br>nut oil came into the room with her.<br><br>Ma Hla May came across to the bed, sat down on the edge and put her<br>arms rather abruptly round Flory. She smelled at his cheek with<br>her flat nose, in the Burmese fashion.<br><br>'Why did my master not send for me this afternoon?' she said.<br><br>'I was sleeping. It is too hot for that kind of thing.'<br><br>'So you would rather sleep alone than with Ma Hla May? How ugly<br>you must think me, then! Am I ugly, master?'<br><br>'Go away,' he said, pushing her back. 'I don't want you at this<br>time of day.'<br><br>'At least touch me with your lips, then. (There is no Burmese word<br>for to kiss.) All white men do that to their women.'<br><br>'There you are, then. Now leave me alone. Fetch some cigarettes<br>and give me one.'<br><br>'Why is it that nowadays you never want to make love to me? Ah,<br>two years ago it was so different! You loved me in those days.<br>You gave me presents of gold bangles and silk longyis from<br>Mandalay. And now look'--Ma Hla May held out one tiny muslin-clad<br>arm--'not a single bangle. Last month I had thirty, and now all of<br>them are pawned. How can I go to the bazaar without my bangles,<br>and wearing the same longyi over and over again? I am ashamed<br>before the other women.'<br><br>'Is it my fault if you pawn your bangles?'<br><br>'Two years ago you would have redeemed them for me. Ah, you do not<br>love Ma Hla May any longer!'<br><br>She put her arms round him again and kissed him, a European habit<br>which he had taught her. A mingled scent of sandalwood, garlic,<br>coco-nut oil and the jasmine in her hair floated from her. It was<br>a scent that always made his teeth tingle. Rather abstractedly he<br>pressed her head back upon the pillow and looked down at her queer,<br>youthful face, with its high cheekbones, stretched eyelids and<br>short, shapely lips. She had rather nice teeth, like the teeth of<br>a kitten. He had bought her from her parents two years ago, for<br>three hundred rupees. He began to stroke her brown throat, rising<br>like a smooth, slender stalk from the collarless ingyi.<br><br>'You only like me because I am a white man and have money,' he<br>said.<br><br>'Master, I love you, I love you more than anything in the world.<br>Why do you say that? Have I not always been faithful to you?'<br><br>'You have a Burmese lover.'<br><br>'Ugh!' Ma Hla May affected to shudder at the thought. 'To think<br>of their horrible brown hands, touching me! I should die if a<br>Burman touched me!'<br><br>'Liar.'<br><br>He put his hand on her breast. Privately, Ma Hla May did not like<br>this, for it reminded her that her breasts existed--the ideal of a<br>Burmese woman being to have no breasts. She lay and let him do as<br>he wished with her, quite passive yet pleased and faintly smiling,<br>like a cat which allows one to stroke it. Flory's embraces meant<br>nothing to her (Ba Pe, Ko S'la's younger brother, was secretly her<br>lover), yet she was bitterly hurt when he neglected them.<br>Sometimes she had even put love-philtres in his food. It was the<br>idle concubine's life that she loved, and the visits to her village<br>dressed in all her finery, when she could boast of her position as<br>a 'bo-kadaw'--a white man's wife; for she had persuaded everyone,<br>herself included, that she was Flory's legal wife.<br><br>When Flory had done with her he turned away, jaded and ashamed, and<br>lay silent with his left hand covering his birthmark. He always<br>remembered the birthmark when he had done something to be ashamed<br>of. He buried his face disgustedly in the pillow, which was damp<br>and smelt of coco-nut oil. It was horribly hot, and the doves<br>outside were still droning. Ma Hla May, naked, reclined beside<br>Flory, fanning him gently with a wicker fan she had taken from the<br>table.<br><br>Presently she got up and dressed herself, and lighted a cigarette.<br>Then, coming back to the bed, she sat down and began stroking<br>Flory's bare shoulder. The whiteness of his skin had a fascination<br>for her, because of its strangeness and the sense of power it gave<br>her. But Flory twitched his shoulder to shake her hand away. At<br>these times she was nauseating and dreadful to him. His sole wish<br>was to get her out of his sight.<br><br>'Get out,' he said.<br><br>Ma Hla May took her cigarette from her mouth and tried to offer it<br>to Flory. 'Why is master always so angry with me when he has made<br>love to me?' she said.<br><br>'Get out,' he repeated.<br><br>Ma Hla May continued to stroke Flory's shoulder. She had never<br>learned the wisdom of leaving him alone at these times. She<br>believed that lechery was a form of witchcraft, giving a woman<br>magical powers over a man, until in the end she could weaken him to<br>a half-idiotic slave. Each successive embrace sapped Flory's will<br>and made the spell stronger--this was her belief. She began<br>tormenting him to begin over again. She laid down her cigarette<br>and put her arms round him, trying to turn him towards her and kiss<br>his averted face, reproaching him for his coldness.<br><br>'Go away, go away!' he said angrily. 'Look in the pocket of my<br>shorts. There is money there. Take five rupees and go.'<br><br>Ma Hla May found the five-rupee note and stuffed it into the bosom<br>of her ingyi, but she still would not go. She hovered about the<br>bed, worrying Flory until at last he grew angry and jumped up.<br><br>'Get out of this room! I told you to go. I don't want you in here<br>after I've done with you.'<br><br>'That is a nice way to speak to me! You treat me as though I were<br>a prostitute.'<br><br>'So you are. Out you go,' he said, pushing her out of the room by<br>her shoulders. He kicked her sandals after her. Their encounters<br>often ended in this way.<br><br>Flory stood in the middle of the room, yawning. Should he go down<br>to the Club for tennis after all? No, it meant shaving, and he<br>could not face the effort of shaving until he had a few drinks<br>inside him. He felt his scrubby chin and lounged across to the<br>mirror to examine it, but then turned away. He did not want to see<br>the yellow, sunken face that would look back at him. For several<br>minutes he stood slack-limbed, watching the tuktoo stalk a moth<br>above the bookshelves. The cigarette that Ma Hla May had dropped<br>burned down with an acrid smell, browning the paper. Flory took a<br>book from the shelves, opened it and then threw it away in<br>distaste. He had not even the energy to read. Oh God, God, what<br>to do with the rest of this bloody evening?<br><br>Flo waddled into the room, wagging her tail and asking to be taken<br>for a walk. Flory went sulkily into the little stone-floored<br>bathroom that gave on to the bedroom, splashed himself with<br>lukewarm water and put on his shirt and shorts. He must take some<br>kind of exercise before the sun went down. In India it is in some<br>way evil to spend a day without being once in a muck-sweat. It<br>gives one a deeper sense of sin than a thousand lecheries. In the<br>dark evening, after a quite idle day, one's ennui reaches a pitch<br>that is frantic, suicidal. Work, prayer, books, drinking, talking--<br>they are all powerless against it; it can only be sweated out<br>through the pores of the skin.<br><br>Flory went out and followed the road uphill into the jungle. It<br>was scrub jungle at first, with dense stunted bushes, and the only<br>trees were half-wild mangoes, bearing little turpentiny fruits the<br>size of plums. Then the road struck among taller trees. The<br>jungle was dried-up and lifeless at this time of year. The trees<br>lined the road in close, dusty ranks, with leaves a dull olive-<br>green. No birds were visible except some ragged brown creatures<br>like disreputable thrushes, which hopped clumsily under the bushes;<br>in the distance some other bird uttered a cry of 'AH ha ha! AH ha<br>ha!'--a lonely, hollow sound like the echo of a laugh. There was a<br>poisonous, ivy-like smell of crushed leaves. It was still hot,<br>though the sun was losing its glare and the slanting light was<br>yellow.<br><br>After two miles the road ended at the ford of a shallow stream.<br>The jungle grew greener here, because of the water, and the trees<br>were taller. At the edge of the stream there was a huge dead<br>pyinkado tree festooned with spidery orchids, and there were some<br>wild lime bushes with white waxen flowers. They had a sharp scent<br>like bergamot. Flory had walked fast and the sweat had drenched<br>his shirt and dribbled, stinging, into his eyes. He had sweated<br>himself into a better mood. Also, the sight of this stream always<br>heartened him; its water was quite clear, rarest of sights in a<br>miry country. He crossed the stream by the stepping stones, Flo<br>splashing after him, and turned into a narrow track he knew, which<br>led through the bushes. It was a track that cattle had made,<br>coming to the stream to drink, and few human beings ever followed<br>it. It led to a pool fifty yards upstream. Here a peepul tree<br>grew, a great buttressed thing six feet thick, woven of innumerable<br>strands of wood, like a wooden cable twisted by a giant. The roots<br>of the tree made a natural cavern, under which the clear greenish<br>water bubbled. Above and all around dense foliage shut out the<br>light, turning the place into a green grotto walled with leaves.<br><br>Flory threw off his clothes and stepped into the water. It was a<br>shade cooler than the air, and it came up to his neck when he sat<br>down. Shoals of silvery mahseer, no bigger than sardines, came<br>nosing and nibbling at his body. Flo had also flopped into the<br>water, and she swam round silently, otter-like, with her webbed<br>feet. She knew the pool well, for they often came here when Flory<br>was at Kyauktada.<br><br>There was a stirring high up in the peepul tree, and a bubbling<br>noise like pots boiling. A flock of green pigeons were up there,<br>eating the berries. Flory gazed up into the great green dome of<br>the tree, trying to distinguish the birds; they were invisible,<br>they matched the leaves so perfectly, and yet the whole tree was<br>alive with them, shimmering, as though the ghosts of birds were<br>shaking it. Flo rested herself against the roots and growled up at<br>the invisible creatures. Then a single green pigeon fluttered down<br>and perched on a lower branch. It did not know that it was being<br>watched. It was a tender thing, smaller than a tame dove, with<br>jade-green back as smooth as velvet, and neck and breast of<br>iridescent colours. Its legs were like the pink wax that dentists<br>use.<br><br>The pigeon rocked itself backwards and forwards on the bough,<br>swelling out its breast feathers and laying its coralline beak upon<br>them. A pang went through Flory. Alone, alone, the bitterness of<br>being alone! So often like this, in lonely places in the forest,<br>he would come upon something--bird, flower, tree--beautiful beyond<br>all words, if there had been a soul with whom to share it. Beauty<br>is meaningless until it is shared. If he had one person, just one,<br>to halve his loneliness! Suddenly the pigeon saw the man and dog<br>below, sprang into the air and dashed away swift as a bullet, with<br>a rattle of wings. One does not often see green pigeons so closely<br>when they are alive. They are high-flying birds, living in the<br>treetops, and they do not come to the ground, or only to drink.<br>When one shoots them, if they are not killed outright, they cling<br>to the branch until they die, and drop long after one has given up<br>waiting and gone away.<br><br>Flory got out of the water, put on his clothes and recrossed the<br>stream. He did not go home by the road, but followed a foot-track<br>southward into the jungle, intending to make a detour and pass<br>through a village that lay in the fringe of the jungle not far from<br>his house. Flo frisked in and out of the undergrowth, yelping<br>sometimes when her long ears caught in the thorns. She had once<br>turned up a hare near here. Flory walked slowly. The smoke of his<br>pipe floated straight upwards in still plumes. He was happy and at<br>peace after the walk and the clear water. It was cooler now,<br>except for patches of heat lingering under the thicker trees, and<br>the light was gentle. Bullock-cart wheels were screaming<br>peacefully in the distance.<br><br>Soon they had lost their way in the jungle, and were wandering in a<br>maze of dead trees and tangled bushes. They came to an impasse<br>where the path was blocked by large ugly plants like magnified<br>aspidistras, whose leaves terminated in long lashes armed with<br>thorns. A firefly glowed greenish at the bottom of a bush; it was<br>getting twilight in the thicker places. Presently the bullock-cart<br>wheels screamed nearer, taking a parallel course.<br><br>'Hey, saya gyi, saya gyi!' Flory shouted, taking Flo by the collar<br>to prevent her running away.<br><br>'Ba le-de?' the Burman shouted back. There was the sound of<br>plunging hooves and of yells to the bullocks.<br><br>'Come here, if you please, O venerable and learned sir! We have<br>lost our way. Stop a moment, O great builder of pagodas!'<br><br>The Burman left his cart and pushed through the jungle, slicing the<br>creepers with his dah. He was a squat middle-aged man with one<br>eye. He led the way back to the track, and Flory climbed on to the<br>flat, uncomfortable bullock cart. The Burman took up the string<br>reins, yelled to the bullocks, prodded the roots of their tails<br>with his short stick, and the cart jolted on with a shriek of<br>wheels. The Burmese bullock-cart drivers seldom grease their<br>axles, probably because they believe that the screaming keeps away<br>evil spirits, though when questioned they will say that it is<br>because they are too poor to buy grease.<br><br>They passed a whitewashed wooden pagoda, no taller than a man and<br>half hidden by the tendrils of creeping plants. Then the track<br>wound into the village, which consisted of twenty ruinous, wooden<br>huts roofed with thatch, and a well beneath some barren date-palms.<br>The egrets that roosted in the palms were streaming homewards over<br>the treetops like white flights of arrows. A fat yellow woman with<br>her longyi hitched under her armpits was chasing a dog round a hut,<br>smacking at it with a bamboo and laughing, and the dog was also<br>laughing in its fashion. The village was called Nyaunglebin--'the<br>four peepul trees'; there were no peepul trees there now, probably<br>they had been cut down and forgotten a century ago. The villagers<br>cultivated a narrow strip of fields that lay between the town and<br>the jungle, and they also made bullock carts which they sold in<br>Kyauktada. Bullock-cart wheels were littered everywhere under the<br>houses; massive things five feet across, with spokes roughly but<br>strongly carved.<br><br>Flory got off the cart and gave the driver a present of four annas.<br>Some brindled curs hurried from beneath the houses to sniff at Flo,<br>and a flock of pot-bellied, naked children, with their hair tied in<br>top-knots, also appeared, curious about the white man but keeping<br>their distance. The village headman, a wizened, leaf-brown old<br>man, came out of his house, and there were shikoings. Flory sat<br>down on the steps of the headman's house and relighted his pipe.<br>He was thirsty.<br><br>'Is the water in your well good to drink, thugyi-min?'<br><br>The headman reflected, scratching the calf of his left leg with his<br>right big toenail. 'Those who drink it, drink it, thakin. And<br>those who do not drink it, do not drink it.'<br><br>'Ah. That is wisdom.'<br><br>The fat woman who had chased the pariah brought a blackened<br>earthenware teapot and a handleless bowl, and gave Flory some pale<br>green tea, tasting of wood-smoke.<br><br>'I must be going, thugyi-min. Thank you for the tea.'<br><br>'God go with you, thakin.'<br><br>Flory went home by a path that led out on to the maidan. It was<br>dark now. Ko S'la had put on a clean ingyi and was waiting in the<br>bedroom. He had heated two kerosene tins of bath-water, lighted<br>the petrol lamps and laid out a clean suit and shirt for Flory.<br>The clean clothes were intended as a hint that Flory should shave,<br>dress himself and go down to the Club after dinner. Occasionally<br>he spent the evening in Shan trousers, loafing in a chair with a<br>book, and Ko S'la disapproved of this habit. He hated to see his<br>master behaving differently from other white men. The fact that<br>Flory often came back from the Club drunk, whereas he remained<br>sober when he stayed at home, did not alter Ko S'la's opinion,<br>because getting drunk was normal and pardonable in a white man.<br><br>'The woman has gone down to the bazaar,' he announced, pleased, as<br>he always was when Ma Hla May left the house. 'Ba Pe has gone with<br>a lantern, to look after her when she comes back.'<br><br>'Good,' Flory said.<br><br>She had gone to spend her five rupees--gambling, no doubt. 'The<br>holy one's bath-water is ready.'<br><br>'Wait, we must attend to the dog first. Bring the comb,' Flory<br>said.<br><br>The two men squatted on the floor together and combed Flo's silky<br>coat and felt between her toes, picking out the ticks. It had to<br>be done every evening. She picked up vast numbers of ticks during<br>the day, horrible grey things that were the size of pin-heads when<br>they got on to her, and gorged themselves till they were as large<br>as peas. As each tick was detached Ko S'la put it on the floor and<br>carefully crushed it with his big toe.<br><br>Then Flory shaved, bathed, dressed, and sat down to dinner. Ko<br>S'la stood behind his chair, handing him the dishes and fanning him<br>with the wicker fan. He had arranged a bowl of scarlet hibiscus<br>flowers in the middle of the little table. The meal was pretentious<br>and filthy. The clever 'Mug' cooks, descendants of servants trained<br>by Frenchmen in India centuries ago, can do anything with food<br>except make it eatable. After dinner Flory walked down to the Club,<br>to play bridge and get three parts drunk, as he did most evenings<br>when he was in Kyauktada. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/2.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/4.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
