<h2>Chapter 1</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">U Po Kyin, Sub-divisional Magistrate of Kyauktada, in Upper Burma,<br>was sitting in his veranda. It was only half past eight, but the<br>month was April, and there was a closeness in the air, a threat of<br>the long, stifling midday hours. Occasional faint breaths of wind,<br>seeming cool by contrast, stirred the newly drenched orchids that<br>hung from the eaves. Beyond the orchids one could see the dusty,<br>curved trunk of a palm tree, and then the blazing ultramarine sky.<br>Up in the zenith, so high that it dazzled one to look at them, a<br>few vultures circled without the quiver of a wing.<br><br>Unblinking, rather like a great porcelain idol, U Po Kyin gazed out<br>into the fierce sunlight. He was a man of fifty, so fat that for<br>years he had not risen from his chair without help, and yet shapely<br>and even beautiful in his grossness; for the Burmese do not sag and<br>bulge like white men, but grow fat symmetrically, like fruits<br>swelling. His face was vast, yellow and quite unwrinkled, and his<br>eyes were tawny. His feet--squat, high-arched feet with the toes<br>all the same length--were bare, and so was his cropped head, and he<br>wore one of those vivid Arakanese longyis with green and magenta<br>checks which the Burmese wear on informal occasions. He was<br>chewing betel from a lacquered box on the table, and thinking about<br>his past life.<br><br>It had been a brilliantly successful life. U Po Kyin's earliest<br>memory, back in the eighties, was of standing, a naked pot-bellied<br>child, watching the British troops march victorious into Mandalay.<br>He remembered the terror he had felt of those columns of great<br>beef-fed men, red-faced and red-coated; and the long rifles over<br>their shoulders, and the heavy, rhythmic tramp of their boots. He<br>had taken to his heels after watching them for a few minutes. In<br>his childish way he had grasped that his own people were no match<br>for this race of giants. To fight on the side of the British, to<br>become a parasite upon them, had been his ruling ambition, even as<br>a child.<br><br>At seventeen he had tried for a Government appointment, but he had<br>failed to get it, being poor and friendless, and for three years<br>he had worked in the stinking labyrinth of the Mandalay bazaars,<br>clerking for the rice merchants and sometimes stealing. Then when<br>he was twenty a lucky stroke of blackmail put him in possession of<br>four hundred rupees, and he went at once to Rangoon and bought his<br>way into a Government clerkship. The job was a lucrative one<br>though the salary was small. At that time a ring of clerks were<br>making a steady income by misappropriating Government stores, and<br>Po Kyin (he was plain Po Kyin then: the honorific U came years<br>later) took naturally to this kind of thing. However, he had too<br>much talent to spend his life in a clerkship, stealing miserably in<br>annas and pice. One day he discovered that the Government, being<br>short of minor officials, were going to make some appointments from<br>among the clerks. The news would have become public in another<br>week, but it was one of Po Kyin's qualities that his information<br>was always a week ahead of everyone else's. He saw his chance and<br>denounced all his confederates before they could take alarm. Most<br>of them were sent to prison, and Po Kyin was made an Assistant<br>Township Officer as the reward of his honesty. Since then he had<br>risen steadily. Now, at fifty-six, he was a Sub-divisional<br>Magistrate, and he would probably be promoted still further and<br>made an acting Deputy Commissioner, with Englishmen as his equals<br>and even his subordinates.<br><br>As a magistrate his methods were simple. Even for the vastest<br>bribe he would never sell the decision of a case, because he knew<br>that a magistrate who gives wrong judgments is caught sooner or<br>later. His practice, a much safer one, was to take bribes from<br>both sides and then decide the case on strictly legal grounds.<br>This won him a useful reputation for impartiality. Besides his<br>revenue from litigants, U Po Kyin levied a ceaseless toll, a sort<br>of private taxation scheme, from all the villages under his<br>jurisdiction. If any village failed in its tribute U Po Kyin took<br>punitive measures--gangs of dacoits attacked the village, leading<br>villagers were arrested on false charges, and so forth--and it was<br>never long before the amount was paid up. He also shared the<br>proceeds of all the larger-sized robberies that took place in the<br>district. Most of this, of course, was known to everyone except U<br>Po Kyin's official superiors (no British officer will ever believe<br>anything against his own men) but the attempts to expose him<br>invariably failed; his supporters, kept loyal by their share of the<br>loot, were too numerous. When any accusation was brought against<br>him, U Po Kyin simply discredited it with strings of suborned<br>witnesses, following this up by counter-accusations which left him<br>in a stronger position than ever. He was practically invulnerable,<br>because he was too fine a judge of men ever to choose a wrong<br>instrument, and also because he was too absorbed in intrigue ever<br>to fail through carelessness or ignorance. One could say with<br>practical certainty that he would never be found out, that he would<br>go from success to success, and would finally die full of honour,<br>worth several lakhs of rupees.<br><br>And even beyond the grave his success would continue. According to<br>Buddhist belief, those who have done evil in their lives will spend<br>the next incarnation in the shape of a rat, a frog or some other<br>low animal. U Po Kyin was a good Buddhist and intended to provide<br>against this danger. He would devote his closing years to good<br>works, which would pile up enough merit to outweigh the rest of his<br>life. Probably his good works would take the form of building<br>pagodas. Four pagodas, five, six, seven--the priests would tell<br>him how many--with carved stonework, gilt umbrellas and little<br>bells that tinkled in the wind, every tinkle a prayer. And he<br>would return to the earth in male human shape--for a woman ranks<br>at about the same level as a rat or a frog--or at best as some<br>dignified beast such as an elephant.<br><br>All these thoughts flowed through U Po Kyin's mind swiftly and for<br>the most part in pictures. His brain, though cunning, was quite<br>barbaric, and it never worked except for some definite end; mere<br>meditation was beyond him. He had now reached the point to which<br>his thoughts had been tending. Putting his smallish, triangular<br>hands on the arms of his chair, he turned himself a little way<br>round and called, rather wheezily:<br><br>'Ba Taik! Hey, Ba Taik!'<br><br>Ba Taik, U Po Kyin's servant, appeared through the beaded curtain<br>of the veranda. He was an under-sized, pock-marked man with a<br>timid and rather hungry expression. U Po Kyin paid him no wages,<br>for he was a convicted thief whom a word would send to prison. As<br>Ba Taik advanced he shikoed, so low as to give the impression that<br>he was stepping backwards.<br><br>'Most holy god?' he said.<br><br>'Is anyone waiting to see me, Ba Taik?'<br><br>Ba Taik enumerated the visitors upon his fingers: 'There is the<br>headman of Thitpingyi village, your honour, who has brought<br>presents, and two villagers who have an assault case that is to be<br>tried by your honour, and they too have brought presents. Ko Ba<br>Sein, the head clerk of the Deputy Commissioner s office, wishes to<br>see you, and there is Ali Shah, the police constable, and a dacoit<br>whose name I do not know. I think they have quarrelled about some<br>gold bangles they have stolen. And there is also a young village<br>girl with a baby.'<br><br>'What does she want?' said U Po Kyin.<br><br>'She says that the baby is yours, most holy one.'<br><br>'Ah. And how much has the headman brought?'<br><br>Ba Taik thought it was only ten rupees and a basket of mangoes.<br><br>'Tell the headman,' said U Po Kyin, 'that it should be twenty<br>rupees, and there will be trouble for him and his village if the<br>money is not here tomorrow. I will see the others presently. Ask<br>Ko Ba Sein to come to me here.'<br><br>Ba Sein appeared in a moment. He was an erect, narrow-shouldered<br>man, very tall for a Burman, with a curiously smooth face that<br>recalled a coffee blancmange. U Po Kyin found him a useful tool.<br>Unimaginative and hardworking, he was an excellent clerk, and Mr<br>Macgregor, the Deputy Commissioner, trusted him with most of his<br>official secrets. U Po Kyin, put in a good temper by his thoughts,<br>greeted Ba Sein with a laugh and waved to the betel box.<br><br>'Well, Ko Ba Sein, how does our affair progress? I hope that, as<br>dear Mr Macgregor would say'--U Po Kyin broke into English--'"eet<br>ees making perceptible progress"?'<br><br>Ba Sein did not smile at the small joke. Sitting down stiff and<br>long-backed in the vacant chair, he answered:<br><br>'Excellently, sir. Our copy of the paper arrived this morning.<br>Kindly observe.'<br><br>He produced a copy of a bilingual paper called the Burmese Patriot.<br>It was a miserable eight-page rag, villainously printed on paper as<br>bad as blotting paper, and composed partly of news stolen from the<br>Rangoon Gazette, partly of weak Nationalist heroics. On the last<br>page the type had slipped and left the entire sheet jet black, as<br>though in mourning for the smallness of the paper's circulation.<br>The article to which U Po Kyin turned was of a rather different<br>stamp from the rest. It ran:<br><br><br>In these happy times, when we poor blacks are being uplifted by the<br>mighty western civilization, with its manifold blessings such as<br>the cinematograph, machine-guns, syphilis, etc., what subject<br>could be more inspiring than the private lives of our European<br>benefactors? We think therefore that it may interest our readers<br>to hear something of events in the up-country district of<br>Kyauktada. And especially of Mr Macgregor, honoured Deputy<br>Commissioner of said district.<br><br>Mr Macgregor is of the type of the Fine Old English Gentleman, such<br>as, in these happy days, we have so many examples before our eyes.<br>He is 'a family man' as our dear English cousins say. Very much a<br>family man is Mr Macgregor. So much so that he has already three<br>children in the district of Kyauktada, where he has been a year,<br>and in his last district of Shwemyo he left six young progenies<br>behind him. Perhaps it is an oversight on Mr Macgregor's part that<br>he has left these young infants quite unprovided for, and that some<br>of their mothers are in danger of starvation, etc., etc., etc.<br><br><br>There was a column of similar stuff, and wretched as it was, it was<br>well above the level of the rest of the paper. U Po Kyin read the<br>article carefully through, holding it at arm's length--he was long-<br>sighted--and drawing his lips meditatively back, exposing great<br>numbers of small, perfect teeth, blood-red from betel juice.<br><br>'The editor will get six months' imprisonment for this,' he said<br>finally.<br><br>'He does not mind. He says that the only time when his creditors<br>leave him alone is when he is in prison.'<br><br>'And you say that your little apprentice clerk Hla Pe wrote this<br>article all by himself? That is a very clever boy--a most<br>promising boy! Never tell me again that these Government High<br>Schools are a waste of time. Hla Pe shall certainly have his<br>clerkship.'<br><br>'You think then, sir, that this article will be enough?'<br><br>U Po Kyin did not answer immediately. A puffing, labouring noise<br>began to proceed from him; he was trying to rise from his chair.<br>Ba Taik was familiar with this sound. He appeared from behind the<br>beaded curtain, and he and Ba Sein put a hand under each of U Po<br>Kyin's armpits and hoisted him to his feet. U Po Kyin stood for a<br>moment balancing the weight of his belly upon his legs, with the<br>movement of a fish porter adjusting his load. Then he waved Ba<br>Taik away.<br><br>'Not enough,' he said, answering Ba Sein's question, 'not enough by<br>any means. There is a lot to be done yet. But this is the right<br>beginning. Listen.'<br><br>He went to the rail to spit out a scarlet mouthful of betel, and<br>then began to quarter the veranda with short steps, his hands<br>behind his back. The friction of his vast thighs made him waddle<br>slightly. As he walked he talked, in the base jargon of the<br>Government offices--a patchwork of Burmese verbs and English<br>abstract phrases:<br><br>'Now, let us go into this affair from the beginning. We are going<br>to make a concerted attack on Dr Veraswami, who is the Civil<br>Surgeon and Superintendent of the jail. We are going to slander<br>him, destroy his reputation and finally ruin him for ever. It will<br>be rather a delicate operation.'<br><br>'Yes, sir.'<br><br>'There will be no risk, but we have got to go slowly. We are not<br>proceeding against a miserable clerk or police constable. We are<br>proceeding against a high official, and with a high official, even<br>when he is an Indian, it is not the same as with a clerk. How does<br>one ruin a clerk? Easy; an accusation, two dozen witnesses,<br>dismissal and imprisonment. But that will not do here. Softly,<br>softly, softly is my way. No scandal, and above all no official<br>inquiry. There must be no accusations that can be answered, and<br>yet within three months I must fix it in the head of every European<br>in Kyauktada that the doctor is a villain. What shall I accuse him<br>of? Bribes will not do, a doctor does not get bribes to any<br>extent. What then?'<br><br>'We could perhaps arrange a mutiny in the jail,' said Ba Sein.<br>'As superintendent, the doctor would be blamed.'<br><br>'No, it is too dangerous. I do not want the jail warders firing<br>their rifles in all directions. Besides, it would be expensive.<br>Clearly, then, it must be disloyalty--Nationalism, seditious<br>propaganda. We must persuade the Europeans that the doctor holds<br>disloyal, anti-British opinions. That is far worse than bribery;<br>they expect a native official to take bribes. But let them suspect<br>his loyalty even for a moment, and he is ruined.'<br><br>'It would be a hard thing to prove,' objected Ba Sein. 'The doctor<br>is very loyal to the Europeans. He grows angry when anything is<br>said against them. They will know that, do you not think?'<br><br>'Nonsense, nonsense,' said U Po Kyin comfortably. 'No European<br>cares anything about proofs. When a man has a black face,<br>suspicion IS proof. A few anonymous letters will work wonders. It<br>is only a question of persisting; accuse, accuse, go on accusing--<br>that is the way with Europeans. One anonymous letter after<br>another, to every European in turn. And then, when their<br>suspicions are thoroughly aroused--' U Po Kyin brought one short<br>arm from behind his back and clicked his thumb and finger. He<br>added: 'We begin with this article in the Burmese Patriot. The<br>Europeans will shout with rage when they see it. Well, the next<br>move is to persuade them that it was the doctor who wrote it.'<br><br>'It will be difficult while he has friends among the Europeans.<br>All of them go to him when they are ill. He cured Mr Macgregor of<br>his flatulence this cold weather. They consider him a very clever<br>doctor, I believe.'<br><br>'How little you understand the European mind, Ko Ba Sein! If the<br>Europeans go to Veraswami it is only because there is no other<br>doctor in Kyauktada. No European has any faith in a man with a<br>black face. No, with anonymous letters it is only a question of<br>sending enough. I shall soon see to it that he has no friends<br>left.'<br><br>'There is Mr Flory, the timber merchant,' said Ba Sein. (He<br>pronounced it 'Mr Porley'.) 'He is a close friend of the doctor.<br>I see him go to his house every morning when he is in Kyauktada.<br>Twice he has even invited the doctor to dinner.'<br><br>'Ah, now there you are right. If Flory were a friend of the doctor<br>it could do us harm. You cannot hurt an Indian when he has a<br>European friend. It gives him--what is that word they are so fond<br>of?--prestige. But Flory will desert his friend quickly enough<br>when the trouble begins. These people have no feeling of loyalty<br>towards a native. Besides, I happen to know that Flory is a<br>coward. I can deal with him. Your part, Ko Ba Sein, is to watch<br>Mr Macgregor's movements. Has he written to the Commissioner<br>lately--written confidentially, I mean?'<br><br>'He wrote two days ago, but when we steamed the letter open we<br>found it was nothing of importance.'<br><br>'Ah well, we will give him something to write about. And as soon<br>as he suspects the doctor, then is the time for that other affair I<br>spoke to you of. Thus we shall--what does Mr Macgregor say? Ah<br>yes, "kill two birds with one stone". A whole flock of birds--ha,<br>ha!'<br><br>U Po Kyin's laugh was a disgusting bubbling sound deep down in his<br>belly, like the preparation for a cough; yet it was merry, even<br>childlike. He did not say any more about the 'other affair', which<br>was too private to be discussed even upon the veranda. Ba Sein,<br>seeing the interview at an end, stood up and bowed, angular as a<br>jointed ruler.<br><br>'Is there anything else your honour wishes done?' he said.<br><br>'Make sure that Mr Macgregor has his copy of the Burmese Patriot.<br>You had better tell Hla Pe to have an attack of dysentery and stay<br>away from the office. I shall want him for the writing of the<br>anonymous letters. That is all for the present.'<br><br>'Then I may go, sir?'<br><br>'God go with you,' said U Po Kyin rather abstractedly, and at once<br>shouted again for Ba Taik. He never wasted a moment of his day.<br>It did not take him long to deal with the other visitors and to<br>send the village girl away unrewarded, having examined her face and<br>said that he did not recognize her. It was now his breakfast time.<br>Violent pangs of hunger, which attacked him punctually at this hour<br>every morning, began to torment his belly. He shouted urgently:<br><br>'Ba Taik! Hey, Ba Taik! Kin Kin! My breakfast! Be quick, I am<br>starving.'<br><br>In the living-room behind the curtain a table was already set out<br>with a huge bowl of rice and a dozen plates containing curries,<br>dried prawns and sliced green mangoes. U Po Kyin waddled to the<br>table, sat down with a grunt and at once threw himself on the food.<br>Ma Kin, his wife, stood behind him and served him. She was a thin<br>woman of five and forty, with a kindly, pale brown, simian face.<br>U Po Kyin took no notice of her while he was eating. With the bowl<br>close to his nose he stuffed the food into himself with swift,<br>greasy fingers, breathing fast. All his meals were swift,<br>passionate and enormous; they were not meals so much as orgies,<br>debauches of curry and rice. When he had finished he sat back,<br>belched several times and told Ma Kin to fetch him a green Burmese<br>cigar. He never smoked English tobacco, which he declared had no<br>taste in it.<br><br>Presently, with Ba Taik's help, U Po Kyin dressed in his office<br>clothes, and stood for a while admiring himself in the long mirror<br>in the living-room. It was a wooden-walled room with two pillars,<br>still recognizable as teak-trunks, supporting the roof-tree, and it<br>was dark and sluttish as all Burmese rooms are, though U Po Kyin<br>had furnished it 'Ingaleik fashion' with a veneered sideboard and<br>chairs, some lithographs of the Royal Family and a fire-<br>extinguisher. The floor was covered with bamboo mats, much<br>splashed by lime and betel juice.<br><br>Ma Kin was sitting on a mat in the corner, stitching an ingyi.<br>U Po Kyin turned slowly before the mirror, trying to get a glimpse<br>of his back view. He was dressed in a gaungbaung of pale pink<br>silk, an ingyi of starched muslin, and a paso of Mandalay silk,<br>a gorgeous salmon-pink brocaded with yellow. With an effort he<br>turned his head round and looked, pleased, at the paso tight and<br>shining on his enormous buttocks. He was proud of his fatness,<br>because he saw the accumulated flesh as the symbol of his<br>greatness. He who had once been obscure and hungry was now fat,<br>rich and feared. He was swollen with the bodies of his enemies;<br>a thought from which he extracted something very near poetry.<br><br>'My new paso was cheap at twenty-two rupees, hey, Kin Kin?' he<br>said.<br><br>Ma Kin bent her head over her sewing. She was a simple, old-<br>fashioned woman, who had learned even less of European habits than<br>U Po Kyin. She could not sit on a chair without discomfort. Every<br>morning she went to the bazaar with a basket on her head, like a<br>village woman, and in the evenings she could be seen kneeling in<br>the garden, praying to the white spire of the pagoda that crowned<br>the town. She had been the confidante of U Po Kyin's intrigues for<br>twenty years and more.<br><br>'Ko Po Kyin,' she said, 'you have done very much evil in your<br>life.'<br><br>U Po Kyin waved his hand. 'What does it matter? My pagodas will<br>atone for everything. There is plenty of time.'<br><br>Ma Kin bent her head over her sewing again, in an obstinate way she<br>had when she disapproved of something that U Po Kyin was doing.<br><br>'But, Ko Po Kyin, where is the need for all this scheming and<br>intriguing? I heard you talking with Ko Ba Sein on the veranda.<br>You are planning some evil against Dr Veraswami. Why do you wish<br>to harm that Indian doctor? He is a good man.'<br><br>'What do you know of these official matters, woman? The doctor<br>stands in my way. In the first place he refuses to take bribes,<br>which makes it difficult for the rest of us. And besides--well,<br>there is something else which you would never have the brains to<br>understand.'<br><br>'Ko Po Kyin, you have grown rich and powerful, and what good has it<br>ever done you? We were happier when we were poor. Ah, I remember<br>so well when you were only a Township Officer, the first time we<br>had a house of our own. How proud we were of our new wicker<br>furniture, and your fountain-pen with the gold clip! And when the<br>young English police-officer came to our house and sat in the best<br>chair and drank a bottle of beer, how honoured we thought<br>ourselves! Happiness is not in money. What can you want with more<br>money now?'<br><br>'Nonsense, woman, nonsense! Attend to your cooking and sewing and<br>leave official matters to those who understand them.'<br><br>'Well, I do not know. I am your wife and have always obeyed you.<br>But at least it is never too soon to acquire merit. Strive to<br>acquire more merit, Ko Po Kyin! Will you not, for instance, buy<br>some live fish and set them free in the river? One can acquire<br>much merit in that way. Also, this morning when the priests came<br>for their rice they told me that there are two new priests at the<br>monastery, and they are hungry. Will you not give them something,<br>Ko Po Kyin? I did not give them anything myself, so that you might<br>acquire the merit of doing it.'<br><br>U Po Kyin turned away from the mirror. The appeal touched him a<br>little. He never, when it could be done without inconvenience,<br>missed a chance of acquiring merit. In his eyes his pile of merit<br>was a kind of bank deposit, everlastingly growing. Every fish set<br>free in the river, every gift to a priest, was a step nearer<br>Nirvana. It was a reassuring thought. He directed that the basket<br>of mangoes brought by the village headman should be sent down to<br>the monastery.<br><br>Presently he left the house and started down the road, with Ba Taik<br>behind him carrying a file of papers. He walked slowly, very<br>upright to balance his vast belly, and holding a yellow silk<br>umbrella over his head. His pink paso glittered in the sun like a<br>satin praline. He was going to the court, to try his day's cases.<br><br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/1.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
