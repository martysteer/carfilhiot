<h2>Chapter 11</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Flory and Elizabeth walked down the bazaar road. It was morning,<br>but the air was so hot that to walk in it was like wading through a<br>torrid sea. Strings of Burmans passed, coming from the bazaar, on<br>scraping sandals, and knots of girls who hurried by four and five<br>abreast, with short quick steps, chattering, their burnished hair<br>gleaming. By the roadside, just before you got to the jail, the<br>fragments of a stone pagoda were littered, cracked and overthrown<br>by the strong roots of a peepul tree. The angry carved faces of<br>demons looked up from the grass where they had fallen. Near by<br>another peepul tree had twined itself round a palm, uprooting it<br>and bending it backwards in a wrestle that had lasted a decade.<br><br>They walked on and came to the jail, a vast square block, two<br>hundred yards each way, with shiny concrete walls twenty feet high.<br>A peacock, pet of the jail, was mincing pigeon-toed along the<br>parapet. Six convicts came by, head down, dragging two heavy<br>handcarts piled with earth, under the guard of Indian warders.<br>They were long-sentence men, with heavy limbs, dressed in uniforms<br>of coarse white cloth with small dunces' caps perched on their<br>shaven crowns. Their faces were greyish, cowed and curiously<br>flattened. Their leg-irons jingled with a clear ring. A woman<br>came past carrying a basket of fish on her head. Two crows were<br>circling round it and making darts at it, and the woman was<br>flapping one hand negligently to keep them away.<br><br>There was a din of voices a little distance away. 'The bazaar's<br>just round the corner,' Flory said. 'I think this is a market<br>morning. It's rather fun to watch.'<br><br>He had asked her to come down to the bazaar with him, telling her<br>it would amuse her to see it. They rounded the bend. The bazaar<br>was an enclosure like a very large cattle pen, with low stalls,<br>mostly palm-thatched, round its edge. In the enclosure, a mob of<br>people seethed, shouting and jostling; the confusion of their<br>multi-coloured clothes was like a cascade of hundreds-and-thousands<br>poured out of a jar. Beyond the bazaar one could see the huge,<br>miry river. Tree branches and long streaks of scum raced down it<br>at seven miles an hour. By the bank a fleet of sampans, with sharp<br>beak-like bows on which eyes were painted, rocked at their mooring-<br>poles.<br><br>Flory and Elizabeth stood watching for a moment. Files of women<br>passed balancing vegetable baskets on their heads, and pop-eyed<br>children who stared at the Europeans. An old Chinese in dungarees<br>faded to sky-blue hurried by, nursing some unrecognizable, bloody<br>fragment of a pig's intestines.<br><br>'Let's go and poke around the stalls a bit, shall we?' Flory said.<br><br>'Is it all right going in among the crowd? Everything's so<br>horribly dirty.'<br><br>'Oh, it's all right, they'll make way for us. It'll interest you.'<br><br>Elizabeth followed him doubtfully and even unwillingly. Why was it<br>that he always brought her to these places? Why was he forever<br>dragging her in among the 'natives', trying to get her to take an<br>interest in them and watch their filthy, disgusting habits? It was<br>all wrong, somehow. However, she followed, not feeling able to<br>explain her reluctance. A wave of stifling air met them; there was<br>a reek of garlic, dried fish, sweat, dust, anise, cloves and<br>turmeric. The crowd surged round them, swarms of stocky peasants<br>with cigar-brown faces, withered elders with their grey hair tied<br>in a bun behind, young mothers carrying naked babies astride the<br>hip. Flo was trodden on and yelped. Low, strong shoulders bumped<br>against Elizabeth, as the peasants, too busy bargaining even to<br>stare at a white woman, struggled round the stalls.<br><br>'Look!' Flory was pointing with his stick to a stall, and saying<br>something, but it was drowned by the yells of two women who were<br>shaking their fists at each other over a basket of pineapples.<br>Elizabeth had recoiled from the stench and din, but he did not<br>notice it, and led her deeper into the crowd, pointing to this<br>stall and that. The merchandise was foreign-looking, queer and<br>poor. There were vast pomelos hanging on strings like green moons,<br>red bananas, baskets of heliotrope-coloured prawns the size of<br>lobsters, brittle dried fish tied in bundles, crimson chilis, ducks<br>split open and cured like hams, green coco-nuts, the larvae of the<br>rhinoceros beetle, sections of sugar-cane, dahs, lacquered sandals,<br>check silk longyis, aphrodisiacs in the form of large, soap-like<br>pills, glazed earthenware jars four feet high, Chinese sweetmeats<br>made of garlic and sugar, green and white cigars, purple prinjals,<br>persimmon-seed necklaces, chickens cheeping in wicker cages, brass<br>Buddhas, heart-shaped betel leaves, bottles of Kruschen salts,<br>switches of false hair, red clay cooking-pots, steel shoes for<br>bullocks, papier-mache marionettes, strips of alligator hide with<br>magical properties. Elizabeth's head was beginning to swim. At<br>the other end of the bazaar the sun gleamed through a priest's<br>umbrella, blood-red, as though through the ear of a giant. In<br>front of a stall four Dravidian women were pounding turmeric with<br>heavy stakes in a large wooden mortar. The hot-scented yellow<br>powder flew up and tickled Elizabeth's nostrils, making her sneeze.<br>She felt that she could not endure this place a moment longer. She<br>touched Flory's arm.<br><br>'This crowd--the heat is so dreadful. Do you think we could get<br>into the shade?'<br><br>He turned round. To tell the truth, he had been too busy talking--<br>mostly inaudibly, because of the din--to notice how the heat and<br>stench were affecting her.<br><br>'Oh, I say, I am sorry. Let's get out of it at once. I tell you<br>what, we'll go along to old Li Yeik's shop--he's the Chinese<br>grocer--and he'll get us a drink of something. It is rather<br>stifling here.'<br><br>'All these spices--they kind of take your breath away. And what is<br>that dreadful smell like fish?'<br><br>'Oh, only a kind of sauce they make out of prawns. They bury them<br>and then dig them up several weeks afterwards.'<br><br>'How absolutely horrible!'<br><br>'Quite wholesome, I believe. Come away from that!' he added to<br>Flo, who was nosing at a basket of small gudgeon-like fish with<br>spines on their gills.<br><br>Li Yeik's shop faced the farther end of the bazaar. What Elizabeth<br>had really wanted was to go straight back to the Club, but the<br>European look of Li Yeik's shop-front--it was piled with<br>Lancashire-made cotton shirts and almost incredibly cheap German<br>clocks--comforted her somewhat after the barbarity of the bazaar.<br>They were about to climb the steps when a slim youth of twenty,<br>damnably dressed in a longyi, blue cricket blazer and bright yellow<br>shoes, with his hair parted and greased 'Ingaleik fashion',<br>detached himself from the crowd and came after them. He greeted<br>Flory with a small awkward movement as though restraining himself<br>from shikoing.<br><br>'What is it?' Flory said.<br><br>'Letter, sir.' He produced a grubby envelope.<br><br>'Would you excuse me?' Flory said to Elizabeth, opening the letter.<br>It was from Ma Hla May--or rather, it had been written for her and<br>she had signed it with a cross--and it demanded fifty rupees, in a<br>vaguely menacing manner.<br><br>Flory pulled the youth aside. 'You speak English? Tell Ma Hla May<br>I'll see about this later. And tell her that if she tries<br>blackmailing me she won't get another pice. Do you understand?'<br><br>'Yes, sir.'<br><br>'And now go away. Don't follow me about, or there'll be trouble.'<br><br>'Yes, sir.'<br><br>'A clerk wanting a job,' Flory explained to Elizabeth as they went<br>up the steps. 'They come bothering one at all hours.' And he<br>reflected that the tone of the letter was curious, for he had not<br>expected Ma Hla May to begin blackmailing him so soon; however, he<br>had not time at the moment to wonder what it might mean.<br><br>They went into the shop, which seemed dark after the outer air. Li<br>Yeik, who was sitting smoking among his baskets of merchandise--<br>there was no counter--hobbled eagerly forward when he saw who had<br>come in. Flory was a friend of his. He was an old bent-kneed man<br>dressed in blue, wearing a pigtail, with a chinless yellow face,<br>all cheekbones, like a benevolent skull. He greeted Flory with<br>nasal honking noises which he intended for Burmese, and at once<br>hobbled to the back of the shop to call for refreshments. There<br>was a cool sweetish smell of opium. Long strips of red paper with<br>black lettering were pasted on the walls, and at one side there was<br>a little altar with a portrait of two large, serene-looking people<br>in embroidered robes, and two sticks of incense smouldering in<br>front of it. Two Chinese women, one old, and a girl were sitting<br>on a mat rolling cigarettes with maize straw and tobacco like<br>chopped horsehair. They wore black silk trousers, and their feet,<br>with bulging, swollen insteps, were crammed into red-heeled wooden<br>slippers no bigger than a doll's. A naked child was crawling<br>slowly about the floor like a large yellow frog.<br><br>'Do look at those women's feet!' Elizabeth whispered as soon as Li<br>Yeik's back was turned. 'Isn't it simply dreadful! How do they<br>get them like that? Surely it isn't natural?'<br><br>'No, they deform them artificially. It's going out in China, I<br>believe, but the people here are behind the times. Old Li Yeik's<br>pigtail is another anachronism. Those small feet are beautiful<br>according to Chinese ideas.'<br><br>'Beautiful! They're so horrible I can hardly look at them. These<br>people must be absolute savages!'<br><br>'Oh no! They're highly civilized; more civilized than we are, in<br>my opinion. Beauty's all a matter of taste. There are a people in<br>this country called the Palaungs who admire long necks in women.<br>The girls wear broad brass rings to stretch their necks, and they<br>put on more and more of them until in the end they have necks like<br>giraffes. It's no queerer than bustles or crinolines.'<br><br>At this moment Li Yeik came back with two fat, round-faced Burmese<br>girls, evidently sisters, giggling and carrying between them two<br>chairs and a blue Chinese teapot holding half a gallon. The two<br>girls were or had been Li Yeik's concubines. The old man had<br>produced a tin of chocolates and was prising off the lid and<br>smiling in a fatherly way, exposing three long, tobacco-blackened<br>teeth. Elizabeth sat down in a very uncomfortable frame of mind.<br>She was perfectly certain that it could not be right to accept<br>these people's hospitality. One of the Burmese girls had at once<br>gone behind the chairs and begun fanning Flory and Elizabeth, while<br>the other knelt at their feet and poured out cups of tea. Elizabeth<br>felt very foolish with the girl fanning the back of her neck and the<br>Chinaman grinning in front of her. Flory always seemed to get her<br>into these uncomfortable situations. She took a chocolate from the<br>tin Li Yeik offered her, but she could not bring herself to say<br>'thank you'.<br><br>'Is this ALL RIGHT?' she whispered to Flory.<br><br>'All right?'<br><br>'I mean, ought we to be sitting down in these people's house?<br>Isn't it sort of--sort of infra dig?'<br><br>'It's all right with a Chinaman. They're a favoured race in this<br>country. And they're very democratic in their ideas. It's best to<br>treat them more or less as equals.'<br><br>'This tea looks absolutely beastly. It's quite green. You'd think<br>they'd have the sense to put milk in it, wouldn't you?'<br><br>'It's not bad. It's a special kind of tea old Li Yeik gets from<br>China. It has orange blossoms in it, I believe.'<br><br>'Ugh! It tastes exactly like earth,' she said, having tasted it.<br><br>Li Yeik stood holding his pipe, which was two feet long with a<br>metal bowl the size of an acorn, and watching the Europeans to see<br>whether they enjoyed his tea. The girl behind the chair said<br>something in Burmese, at which both of them burst out giggling<br>again. The one kneeling on the floor looked up and gazed in a<br>naive admiring way at Elizabeth. Then she turned to Flory and<br>asked him whether the English lady wore stays. She pronounced it<br>s'tays.<br><br>'Ch!' said Li Yeik in a scandalized manner, stirring the girl with<br>his toe to silence her.<br><br>'I should hardly care to ask her,' Flory said.<br><br>'Oh, thakin, please do ask her! We are so anxious to know!'<br><br>There was an argument, and the girl behind the chair forgot fanning<br>and joined in. Both of them, it appeared, had been pining all<br>their lives to see a veritable pair of s'tays. They had heard so<br>many tales about them; they were made of steel on the principle of<br>a strait waistcoat, and they compressed a woman so tightly that she<br>had no breasts, absolutely no breasts at all! The girls pressed<br>their hands against their fat ribs in illustration. Would not<br>Flory be so kind as to ask the English lady? There was a room<br>behind the shop where she could come with them and undress. They<br>had been so hoping to see a pair of s'tays.<br><br>Then the conversation lapsed suddenly. Elizabeth was sitting<br>stiffly, holding her tiny cup of tea, which she could not bring<br>herself to taste again, and wearing a rather hard smile. A chill<br>fell upon the Orientals; they realized that the English girl, who<br>could not join in their conversation, was not at her ease. Her<br>elegance and her foreign beauty, which had charmed them a moment<br>earlier, began to awe them a little. Even Flory was conscious of<br>the same feeling. There came one of those dreadful moments that<br>one has with Orientals, when everyone avoids everyone else's eyes,<br>trying vainly to think of something to say. Then the naked child,<br>which had been exploring some baskets at the back of the shop,<br>crawled across to where the European sat. It examined their shoes<br>and stockings with great curiosity, and then, looking up, saw their<br>white faces and was seized with terror. It let out a desolate<br>wail, and began making water on the floor.<br><br>The old Chinese woman looked up, clicked her tongue and went on<br>rolling cigarettes. No one else took the smallest notice. A pool<br>began to form on the floor. Elizabeth was so horrified that she<br>set her cup down hastily, and spilled the tea. She plucked at<br>Flory's arm.<br><br>'That child! Do look what it's doing! Really, can't someone--it's<br>too awful!' For a moment everyone gazed in astonishment, and then<br>they all grasped what was the matter. There was a flurry and a<br>general clicking of tongues. No one had paid any attention to the<br>child--the incident was too normal to be noticed--and now they all<br>felt horribly ashamed. Everyone began putting the blame on the<br>child. There were exclamations of 'What a disgraceful child! What<br>a disgusting child!' The old Chinese woman carried the child,<br>still howling, to the door, and held it out over the step as though<br>wringing out a bath sponge. And in the same moment, as it seemed,<br>Flory and Elizabeth were outside the shop, and he was following her<br>back to the road with Li Yeik and the others looking after them in<br>dismay.<br><br>'If THAT'S what you call civilized people--!' she was exclaiming.<br><br>'I'm sorry,' he said feebly. 'I never expected--'<br><br>'What absolutely DISGUSTING people!'<br><br>She was bitterly angry. Her face had flushed a wonderful delicate<br>pink, like a poppy bud opened a day too soon. It was the deepest<br>colour of which it was capable. He followed her past the bazaar<br>and back to the main road, and they had gone fifty yards before he<br>ventured to speak again.<br><br>'I'm so sorry that this should have happened! Li Yeik is such a<br>decent old chap. He'd hate to think that he'd offended you.<br>Really it would have been better to stay a few minutes. Just to<br>thank him for the tea.'<br><br>'Thank him! After THAT!'<br><br>'But honestly, you oughtn't to mind that sort of thing. Not in<br>this country. These people's whole outlook is so different from<br>ours. One has to adjust oneself. Suppose, for instance, you were<br>back in the Middle Ages--'<br><br>'I think I'd rather not discuss it any longer.'<br><br>It was the first time they had definitely quarrelled. He was too<br>miserable even to ask himself how it was that he offended her.<br>He did not realize that this constant striving to interest her in<br>Oriental things struck her only as perverse, ungentlemanly, a<br>deliberate seeking after the squalid and the 'beastly'. He had not<br>grasped even now with what eyes she saw the 'natives'. He only<br>knew that at each attempt to make her share his life, his thoughts,<br>his sense of beauty, she shied away from him like a frightened<br>horse.<br><br>They walked up the road, he to the left of her and a little behind.<br>He watched her averted cheek and the tiny gold hairs on her nape<br>beneath the brim of her Terai hat. How he loved her, how he loved<br>her! It was as though he had never truly loved her till this<br>moment, when he walked behind her in disgrace, not even daring to<br>show his disfigured face. He made to speak several times, and<br>stopped himself. His voice was not quite ready, and he did not<br>know what he could say that did not risk offending her somehow. At<br>last he said, flatly, with a feeble pretence that nothing was the<br>matter:<br><br>'It's getting beastly hot, isn't it?'<br><br>With the temperature at 90 degrees in the shade it was not a<br>brilliant remark. To his surprise she seized on it with a kind of<br>eagerness. She turned to face him, and she was smiling again.<br><br>'Isn't it simply BAKING!'<br><br>With that they were at peace. The silly, banal remark, bringing<br>with it the reassuring atmosphere of Club-chatter, had soothed her<br>like a charm. Flo, who had lagged behind, came puffing up to them<br>dribbling saliva; in an instant they were talking, quite as usual,<br>about dogs. They talked about dogs for the rest of the way home,<br>almost without a pause. Dogs are an inexhaustible subject. Dogs,<br>dogs! thought Flory as they climbed the hot hillside, with the<br>mounting sun scorching their shoulders through their thin clothes,<br>like the breath of fire--were they never to talk of anything except<br>dogs? Or failing dogs, gramophone records and tennis racquets?<br>And yet, when they kept to trash like this, how easily, how<br>amicably they could talk!<br><br>They passed the glittering white wall of the cemetery and came to<br>the Lackersteens' gate. Old mohur trees grew round it, and a clump<br>of hollyhocks eight feet high, with round red flowers like blowsy<br>girls' faces. Flory took off his hat in the shade and fanned his<br>face.<br><br>'Well, we're back before the worst of the heat comes. I'm afraid<br>our trip to the bazaar wasn't altogether a success.'<br><br>'Oh, not at all! I enjoyed it, really I did.'<br><br>'No--I don't know, something unfortunate always seems to happen.--<br>Oh, by the way! You haven't forgotten that we're going out<br>shooting the day after tomorrow? I hope that day will be all right<br>for you?'<br><br>'Yes, and my uncle's going to lend me his gun. Such awful fun!<br>You'll have to teach me all about shooting. I AM so looking<br>forward to it.'<br><br>'So am I. It's a rotten time of year for shooting, but we'll do<br>our best. Goodbye for the present, then.'<br><br>'Good-bye, Mr Flory.'<br><br>She still called him Mr Flory though he called her Elizabeth. They<br>parted and went their ways, each thinking of the shooting trip,<br>which, both of them felt, would in some way put things right<br>between them. <br><br><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/9.html">&lt;&nbsp;Back</a></font></center><center><font size=3><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Burmese_Days/11.html">Forward&nbsp;&gt;</a></font></center></font></p>
