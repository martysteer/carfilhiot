<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Some months ago I cut out of a shiny magazine some paragraphs written by<br>a female journalist and describing the pleasure resort of the future. She<br>had recently been spending some time at Honolulu, where the rigours of<br>war do not seem to have been very noticeable. However, "a transport<br>pilot. . .told me that with all the inventiveness packed into this war, it<br>was a pity someone hadn't found out how a tired and lifehungry man could<br>relax, rest, play poker, drink, and make love, all at once, and round the<br>clock, and come out of it feeling good and fresh and ready for the job<br>again." This reminded her of an entrepreneur she had met recently who was<br>planning a "pleasure spot which he thinks will catch on tomorrow as dog<br>racing and dance halls did yesterday." The entrepreneur's dream is<br>described in some detail:<br><br><br>His blue-prints pictured a space covering several acres, under a series<br>of sliding roofs-for the British weather is unreliableand with a central<br>space spread over with an immense dance floor made of translucent plastic<br>which can be illuminated from beneath. Around it are grouped other<br>functional spaces, at different levels. Balcony bars and restaurants<br>commanding high views of the city roofs, and ground-level replicas. A<br>battery of skittle alleys. Two blue lagoons: one, periodically agitated<br>by waves, for strong swimmers, and another, a smooth and summery pool,<br>for playtime bathers. Sunlight lamps over the pools to simulate high<br>summer on days when the roofs don't slide back to disclose a hot sun in a<br>cloudless sky. Rows of bunks on which people wearing sun-glasses and<br>slips can lie and start a tan or deepen an existing one under a sunray<br>lamp.<br><br>Music seeping through hundreds of grills connected with a central<br>distributing stage, where dance or symphonic orchestras play or the radio<br>programme can be caught, amplified, and disseminated. Outside, two<br>1,000-car parks. One, free. The other, an open-air cinema drive-in, cars<br>queueing to move through turnstiles, and the film thrown on a giant<br>screen facing a row of assembled cars. Uniformed male attendants check<br>the cars, provide free aid and water, sell petrol and oil. Girls in white<br>satin slacks take orders for buffet dishes and drinks, and bring them on<br>trays.<br><br><br>Whenever one hears such phrases as "pleasure spot", "pleasure resort",<br>"pleasure city", it is difficult not to remember the oftenquoted opening<br>of Coleridge's "Kubla Khan".<br><br>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br>A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>Through caverns measureless to man<br>Down to a sunless sea.<br>So twice five miles of fertile ground<br>With walls and towers were girdled round:<br>And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills<br>Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br>And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<br><br>But it will be seen that Coleridge has got it all wrong. He strikes a<br>false note straight off with that talk about "sacred" rivers and<br>"measureless" caverns. In the hands of the above-mentioned entrepreneur,<br>Kubla Khan's project would have become something quite different. The<br>caverns, air-conditioned, discreetly lighted and with their original<br>rocky interior buried under layers of tastefully-coloured plastics, would<br>be turned into a series of tea-grottoes in the Moorish, Caucasian or<br>Hawaiian styles. Alph, the sacred river, would be dammed up to make an<br>artificially-warmed bathing pool, while the sunless sea would be<br>illuminated from below with pink electric lights, and one would cruise<br>over it in real Venetian gondolas each equipped with its own radio set.<br>The forests and "spots of greenery" referred to by Coleridge would be<br>cleaned up to make way for glass-covered tennis courts, a bandstand, a<br>roller-skating rink and perhaps a ninehole golf course. In short, there<br>would be everything that a "lifehungry" man could desire.<br><br>I have no doubt that, all over the world, hundreds of pleasure resorts<br>similar to the one described above are now being planned, and perhaps are<br>even being built. It is unlikely that they will be finished-world events<br>will see to that-but they represent faithfully enough the modern<br>civilised man's idea of pleasure. Something of the kind is already<br>partially attained in the more magnificent dance halls, movie palaces,<br>hotels, restaurants and luxury liners. On a pleasure cruise or in a Lyons<br>Corner House one already gets something more than a glimpse of this<br>future paradise. Analysed, its main characteristics are these:<br><br>1. One is never alone.<br>2. One never does anything for oneself.<br>3. One is never within sight of wild vegetation or natural objects of any<br>   kind.<br>4. Light and temperature are always artificially regulated.<br>5. One is never out of the sound of music.<br><br>The music-and if possible it should be the same music for everybody-is<br>the most important ingredient. Its function is to prevent thought and<br>conversation, and to shut out any natural sound, such as the song of<br>birds or the whistling of the wind, that might otherwise intrude. The<br>radio is already consciously used for this purpose by innumerable people.<br>In very many English homes the radio is literally never turned off,<br>though it is manipulated from time to time so as to make sure that only<br>light music will come out of it. I know people who will keep the radio<br>playing all through a meal and at the same time continue talking just<br>loudly enough for the voices and the music to cancel out. This is done<br>with a definite purpose. The music prevents the conversation from<br>becoming serious or even coherent, while the chatter of voices stops one<br>from listening attentively to the music and thus prevents the onset of<br>that dreaded thing, thought. For<br><br>The lights must never go out.<br>The music must always play,<br>Lest we should see where we are;<br>Lost in a haunted wood,<br>Children afraid of the dark<br>Who have never been happy or good.<br><br>It is difficult not to feel that the unconscious aim in the most typical<br>modern pleasure resorts is a return to the womb. For there, too, one was<br>never alone, one never saw daylight, the temperature was always<br>regulated, one did not have to worry about work or food, and one's<br>thoughts, if any, were drowned by a continuous rhythmic throbbing.<br><br>When one looks at Coleridge's very different conception of a "pleasure<br>dome", one sees that it revolves partly round gardens and partly round<br>caverns, rivers, forests and mountains with "deep romantic chasms"-in<br>short, round what is called Nature. But the whole notion of admiring<br>Nature, and feeling a sort of religious awe in the presence of glaciers,<br>deserts or waterfalls, is bound up with the sense of man's littleness and<br>weakness against the power of the universe. The moon is beautiful partly<br>because we cannot reach it, (lie sea is impressive because one can never<br>be sure of crossing it safely. Even the pleasure one takes in a<br>flower-and this is true even of a botanist who knows all there is to be<br>known about the floweris dependent partly on the sense of mystery. But<br>meanwhile man's power over Nature is steadily increasing. With the aid of<br>the atomic bomb we could literally move mountains: we could even, so it<br>is said, alter the climate of the earth by melting the polar ice-caps and<br>irrigating the Sahara. Isn't there, therefore, something sentimental and<br>obscurantist in preferring bird-song to swing music and in wanting to<br>leave a few patches of wildness here and there instead of covering the<br>whole surface of the earth with a network of Autobahnen flooded by<br>artificial sunlight?<br><br>The question only arises because in exploring the physical universe man<br>has made no attempt to explore himself. Much of what goes by the name of<br>pleasure is simply an effort to destroy consciousness. If one started by<br>asking, what is man? what are his needs? how can he best express himself<br>? one would discover that merely having the power to avoid work and live<br>one's life from birth to death in electric light and to the tune of<br>tinned music is not a reason for doing so. Man needs warmth, society,<br>leisure, comfort and security: he also needs solitude, creative work and<br>the sense of wonder. If he recognised this he could use the products of<br>science and industrialism eclectically, applying always the same test:<br>does this make me more human or less human? He would then learn that the<br>highest happiness does not lie in relaxing, resting, playing poker,<br>drinking and making love simultaneously. And the instinctive horror which<br>all sensitive people feel at the progressive mechanisation of life would<br>be seen not to be a mere sentimental archaism, but to be fully justified.<br>For man only stays human by preserving large patches of simplicity in his<br>life, while the tendency of many modern inventions-in particular the<br>film, the radio and the aeroplane-is to weaken his consciousness, dull<br>his curiosity, and, in general, drive him nearer to the animals.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font></p>
