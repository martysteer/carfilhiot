<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Now that the brief visit of the Dynamo football team has come to an end,<br>it is possible to say publicly what many thinking people were saying<br>privately before the Dynamos ever arrived. That is, that sport is an<br>unfailing cause of ill-will, and that if such a visit as this had any<br>effect at all on Anglo-Soviet relations, it could only be to make them<br>slightly worse than before.<br><br>Even the newspapers have been unable to conceal the fact that at least<br>two of the four matches played led to much bad feeling. At the Arsenal<br>match, I am told by someone who was there, a British and a Russian player<br>came to blows and the crowd booed the referee. The Glasgow match, someone<br>else informs me, was simply a free-for-all from the start. And then there<br>was the controversy, typical of our nationalistic age, about the<br>composition of the Arsenal team. Was it really an all-England team, as<br>claimed by the Russians, or merely a league team, as claimed by the<br>British? And did the Dynamos end their tour abruptly in order to avoid<br>playing an all-England team? As usual, everyone answers these questions<br>according to his political predilections. Not quite everyone, however. I<br>noted with interest, as an instance of the vicious passions that football<br>provokes, that the sporting correspondent of the russophile NEWS<br>CHRONICLE took the anti-Russian line and maintained that Arsenal was NOT<br>an all-England team. No doubt the controversy will continue to echo for<br>years in the footnotes of history books. Meanwhile the result of the<br>Dynamos' tour, in so far as it has had any result, will have been to<br>create fresh animosity on both sides.<br><br>And how could it be otherwise? I am always amazed when I hear people<br>saying that sport creates goodwill between the nations, and that if only<br>the common peoples of the world could meet one another at football or<br>cricket, they would have no inclination to meet on the battlefield. Even<br>if one didn't know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for<br>instance) that international sporting contests lead to orgies of hatred,<br>one could deduce it from general principles.<br><br>Nearly all the sports practised nowadays are competitive. You play to<br>win, and the game has little meaning unless you do your utmost to win. On<br>the village green, where you pick up sides and no feeling of local<br>patriotism is involved. it is possible to play simply for the fun and<br>exercise: but as soon as the question of prestige arises, as soon as you<br>feel that you and some larger unit will be disgraced if you lose, the<br>most savage combative instincts are aroused. Anyone who has played even<br>in a school football match knows this. At the international level sport<br>is frankly mimic warfare. But the significant thing is not the behaviour<br>of the players but the attitude of the spectators: and, behind the<br>spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over these<br>absurd contests, and seriously believe--at any rate for short<br>periods--that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national<br>virtue.<br><br>Even a leisurely game like cricket, demanding grace rather than strength,<br>can cause much ill-will, as we saw in the controversy over body-line<br>bowling and over the rough tactics of the Australian team that visited<br>England in 1921. Football, a game in which everyone gets hurt and every<br>nation has its own style of play which seems unfair to foreigners, is far<br>worse. Worst of all is boxing. One of the most horrible sights in the<br>world is a fight between white and coloured boxers before a mixed<br>audience. But a boxing audience is always disgusting, and the behaviour<br>of the women, in particular, is such that the army, I believe, does not<br>allow them to attend its contests. At any rate, two or three years ago,<br>when Home Guards and regular troops were holding a boxing tournament, I<br>was placed on guard at the door of the hall, with orders to keep the<br>women out.<br><br>In England, the obsession with sport is bad enough, but even fiercer<br>passions are aroused in young countries where games playing and<br>nationalism are both recent developments. In countries like India or<br>Burma, it is necessary at football matches to have strong cordons of<br>police to keep the crowd from invading the field. In Burma, I have seen<br>the supporters of one side break through the police and disable the<br>goalkeeper of the opposing side at a critical moment. The first big<br>football match that was played in Spain about fifteen years ago led to an<br>uncontrollable riot. As soon as strong feelings of rivalry are aroused,<br>the notion of playing the game according to the rules always vanishes.<br>People want to see one side on top and the other side humiliated, and<br>they forget that victory gained through cheating or through the<br>intervention of the crowd is meaningless. Even when the spectators don't<br>intervene physically they try to influence the game by cheering their own<br>side and "rattling" opposing players with boos and insults. Serious sport<br>has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy,<br>boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing<br>violence: in other words it is war minus the shooting.<br><br>Instead of blah-blahing about the clean, healthy rivalry of the football<br>field and the great part played by the Olympic Games in bringing the<br>nations together, it is more useful to inquire how and why this modern<br>cult of sport arose. Most of the games we now play are of ancient origin,<br>but sport does not seem to have been taken very seriously between Roman<br>times and the nineteenth century. Even in the English public schools the<br>games cult did not start till the later part of the last century. Dr<br>Arnold, generally regarded as the founder of the modern public school,<br>looked on games as simply a waste of time. Then, chiefly in England and<br>the United States, games were built up into a heavily-financed activity,<br>capable of attracting vast crowds and rousing savage passions, and the<br>infection spread from country to country. It is the most violently<br>combative sports, football and boxing, that have spread the widest. There<br>cannot be much doubt that the whole thing is bound up with the rise of<br>nationalism--that is, with the lunatic modern habit of identifying<br>oneself with large power units and seeing everything in terms of<br>competitive prestige. Also, organised games are more likely to flourish<br>in urban communities where the average human being lives a sedentary or<br>at least a confined life, and does not get much opportunity for creative<br>labour. In a rustic community a boy or young man works off a good deal of<br>his surplus energy by walking, swimming, snowballing, climbing trees,<br>riding horses, and by various sports involving cruelty to animals, such<br>as fishing, cock-fighting and ferreting for rats. In a big town one must<br>indulge in group activities if one wants an outlet for one's physical<br>strength or for one's sadistic impulses. Games are taken seriously in<br>London and New York, and they were taken seriously in Rome and Byzantium:<br>in the Middle Ages they were played, and probably played with much<br>physical brutality, but they were not mixed up with politics nor a cause<br>of group hatreds.<br><br>If you wanted to add to the vast fund of ill-will existing in the world<br>at this moment, you could hardly do it better than by a series of<br>football matches between Jews and Arabs, Germans and Czechs, Indians and<br>British, Russians and Poles, and Italians and Jugoslavs, each match to be<br>watched by a mixed audience of 100,000 spectators. I do not, of course,<br>suggest that sport is one of the main causes of international rivalry;<br>big-scale sport is itself, I think, merely another effect of the causes<br>that have produced nationalism. Still, you do make things worse by<br>sending forth a team of eleven men, labelled as national champions, to do<br>battle against some rival team, and allowing it to be felt on all sides<br>that whichever nation is defeated will "lose face".<br><br>I hope, therefore, that we shan't follow up the visit of the Dynamos by<br>sending a British team to the USSR. If we must do so, then let us<br>send a second-rate team which is sure to be beaten and cannot be claimed<br>to represent Britain as a whole. There are quite enough real causes of<br>trouble already, and we need not add to them by encouraging young men to<br>kick each other on the shins amid the roars of infuriated spectators.<br><br></font></p>
