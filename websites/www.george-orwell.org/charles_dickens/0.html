<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">I<br><br><br>Dickens is one of those writers who are well worth stealing. Even the<br>burial of his body in Westminster Abbey was a species of theft, if you<br>come to think of it.<br><br>When Chesterton wrote his introductions to the Everyman Edition of<br>Dickens's works, it seemed quite natural to him to credit Dickens with<br>his own highly individual brand of medievalism, and more recently a<br>Marxist writer, Mr. T. A. Jackson, has made spirited efforts to turn<br>Dickens into a blood-thirsty revolutionary. The Marxist claims him as<br>'almost' a Marxist, the Catholic claims him as 'almost' a Catholic, and<br>both claim him as a champion of the proletariat (or 'the poor', as<br>Chesterton would have put it). On the other hand, Nadezhda Krupskaya, in<br>her little book on Lenin, relates that towards the end of his life Lenin<br>went to see a dramatized version of THE CRICKET ON THE HEARTH, and found<br>Dickens's 'middle-class sentimentality' so intolerable that he walked out<br>in the middle of a scene.<br><br>Taking 'middle-class' to mean what Krupskaya might be expected to mean by<br>it, this was probably a truer judgement than those of Chesterton and<br>Jackson. But it is worth noticing that the dislike of Dickens implied in<br>this remark is something unusual. Plenty of people have found him<br>unreadable, but very few seem to have felt any hostility towards the<br>general spirit of his work. Some years later Mr. Bechhofer Roberts<br>published a full-length attack on Dickens in the form of a novel (THIS<br>SIDE IDOLATRY), but it was a merely personal attack, concerned for the<br>most part with Dickens's treatment of his wife. It dealt with incidents<br>which not one in a thousand of Dickens's readers would ever hear about,<br>and which no more invalidates his work than the second-best bed<br>invalidates HAMLET. All that the book really demonstrated was that a<br>writer's literary personality has little or nothing to do with his<br>private character. It is quite possible that in private life Dickens was<br>just the kind of insensitive egoist that Mr. Bechhofer Roberts makes him<br>appear. But in his published work there is implied a personality quite<br>different from this, a personality which has won him far more friends<br>than enemies. It might well have been otherwise, for even if Dickens was<br>a bourgeois, he was certainly a subversive writer, a radical, one might<br>truthfully say a rebel. Everyone who has read widely in his work has felt<br>this. Gissing, for instance, the best of the writers on Dickens, was<br>anything but a radical himself, and he disapproved of this strain in<br>Dickens and wished it were not there, but it never occurred to him to<br>deny it. In OLIVER TWIST, HARD TIMES, BLEAK HOUSE, LITTLE DORRIT, Dickens<br>attacked English institutions with a ferocity that has never since been<br>approached. Yet he managed to do it without making himself hated, and,<br>more than this, the very people he attacked have swallowed him so<br>completely that he has become a national institution himself. In its<br>attitude towards Dickens the English public has always been a little like<br>the elephant which feels a blow with a walking-stick as a delightful<br>tickling. Before I was ten years old I was having Dickens ladled down my<br>throat by schoolmasters in whom even at that age I could see a strong<br>resemblance to Mr. Creakle, and one knows without needing to be told that<br>lawyers delight in Sergeant Buzfuz and that LITTLE DORRIT is a favourite<br>in the Home Office. Dickens seems to have succeeded in attacking<br>everybody and antagonizing nobody. Naturally this makes one wonder<br>whether after all there was something unreal in his attack upon society.<br>Where exactly does he stand, socially, morally, and politically? As<br>usual, one can define his position more easily if one starts by deciding<br>what he was NOT.<br><br>In the first place he was NOT, as Messrs. Chesterton and Jackson seem to<br>imply, a 'proletarian' writer. To begin with, he does not write about the<br>proletariat, in which he merely resembles the overwhelming majority of<br>novelists, past and present. If you look for the working classes in<br>fiction, and especially English fiction, all you find is a hole. This<br>statement needs qualifying, perhaps. For reasons that are easy enough to<br>see, the agricultural labourer (in England a proletarian) gets a fairly<br>good showing in fiction, and a great deal has been written about<br>criminals, derelicts and, more recently, the working-class<br>intelligentsia. But the ordinary town proletariat, the people who make<br>the wheels go round, have always been ignored by novelists. When they do<br>find their way between the covers of a book, it is nearly always as<br>objects of pity or as comic relief. The central action of Dickens's<br>stories almost invariably takes place in middle-class surroundings. If<br>one examines his novels in detail one finds that his real subject-matter<br>is the London commercial bourgeoisie and their hangers-on--lawyers,<br>clerks, tradesmen, innkeepers, small craftsmen, and servants. He has no<br>portrait of an agricultural worker, and only one (Stephen Blackpool in<br>HARD TIMES) of an industrial worker. The Plornishes in LITTLE DORRIT are<br>probably his best picture of a working-class family--the Peggottys, for<br>instance, hardly belong to the working class--but on the whole he is not<br>successful with this type of character. If you ask any ordinary reader<br>which of Dickens's proletarian characters he can remember, the three he<br>is almost certain to mention are Bill Sykes, Sam Weller, and Mrs. Gamp. A<br>burglar, a valet, and a drunken midwife--not exactly a representative<br>cross-section of the English working class.<br><br>Secondly, in the ordinarily accepted sense of the word, Dickens is not a<br>'revolutionary' writer. But his position here needs some defining.<br><br>Whatever else Dickens may have been, he was not a hole-and-corner<br>soul-saver, the kind of well-meaning idiot who thinks that the world will<br>be perfect if you amend a few bylaws and abolish a few anomalies. It is<br>worth comparing him with Charles Reade, for instance. Reade was a much<br>better-informed man than Dickens, and in some ways more public-spirited.<br>He really hated the abuses he could understand, he showed them up in a<br>series of novels which for all their absurdity are extremely readable,<br>and he probably helped to alter public opinion on a few minor but<br>important points. But it was quite beyond him to grasp that, given the<br>existing form of society, certain evils CANNOT be remedied. Fasten upon<br>this or that minor abuse, expose it, drag it into the open, bring it<br>before a British jury, and all will be well that is how he sees it.<br>Dickens at any rate never imagined that you can cure pimples by cutting<br>them off. In every page of his work one can see a consciousness that<br>society is wrong somewhere at the root. It is when one asks 'Which root?'<br>that one begins to grasp his position.<br><br>The truth is that Dickens's criticism of society is almost exclusively<br>moral. Hence the utter lack of any constructive suggestion anywhere in<br>his work. He attacks the law, parliamentary government, the educational<br>system and so forth, without ever clearly suggesting what he would put in<br>their places. Of course it is not necessarily the business of a novelist,<br>or a satirist, to make constructive suggestions, but the point is that<br>Dickens's attitude is at bottom not even DEStructive. There is no clear<br>sign that he wants the existing order to be overthrown, or that he<br>believes it would make very much difference if it WERE overthrown. For in<br>reality his target is not so much society as 'human nature'. It would be<br>difficult to point anywhere in his books to a passage suggesting that the<br>economic system is wrong AS A SYSTEM. Nowhere, for instance, does he make<br>any attack on private enterprise or private property. Even in a book like<br>OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, which turns on the power of corpses to interfere with<br>living people by means of idiotic wills, it does not occur to him to<br>suggest that individuals ought not to have this irresponsible power. Of<br>course one can draw this inference for oneself, and one can draw it again<br>from the remarks about Bounderby's will at the end of HARD TIMES, and<br>indeed from the whole of Dickens's work one can infer the evil of<br>LAISSEZ-FAIRE capitalism; but Dickens makes no such inference himself. It<br>is said that Macaulay refused to review HARD TIMES because he disapproved<br>of its 'sullen Socialism'. Obviously Macaulay is here using the word<br>'Socialism' in the same sense in which, twenty years ago, a vegetarian<br>meal or a Cubist picture used to be referred to as 'Bolshevism'. There is<br>not a line in the book that can properly be called Socialistic; indeed,<br>its tendency if anything is pro-capitalist, because its whole moral is<br>that capitalists ought to be kind, not that workers ought to be<br>rebellious. Bounder by is a bullying windbag and Gradgrind has been<br>morally blinded, but if they were better men, the system would work well<br>enough that, all through, is the implication. And so far as social<br>criticism goes, one can never extract much more from Dickens than this,<br>unless one deliberately reads meanings into him. His whole 'message' is<br>one that at first glance looks like an enormous platitude: If men would<br>behave decently the world would be decent.<br><br>Naturally this calls for a few characters who are in positions of<br>authority and who DO behave decently. Hence that recurrent Dickens<br>figure, the good rich man. This character belongs especially to Dickens's<br>early optimistic period. He is usually a 'merchant' (we are not<br>necessarily told what merchandise he deals in), and he is always a<br>superhumanly kind-hearted old gentleman who 'trots' to and fro, raising<br>his employees' wages, patting children on the head, getting debtors out<br>of jail and in general, acting the fairy godmother. Of course he is a<br>pure dream figure, much further from real life than, say, Squeers or<br>Micawber. Even Dickens must have reflected occasionally that anyone who<br>was so anxious to give his money away would never have acquired it in the<br>first place. Mr. Pickwick, for instance, had 'been in the city', but it<br>is difficult to imagine him making a fortune there. Nevertheless this<br>character runs like a connecting thread through most of the earlier<br>books. Pickwick, the Cheerybles, old Chuzzlewit, Scrooge--it is the same<br>figure over and over again, the good rich man, handing out guineas.<br>Dickens does however show signs of development here. In the books of the<br>middle period the good rich man fades out to some extent. There is no one<br>who plays this part in A TALE OF TWO CITIES, nor in GREAT EXPECTATIONS--<br>GREAT EXPECTATIONS is, in fact, definitely an attack on patronage--and<br>in HARD TIMES it is only very doubtfully played by Gradgrind after his<br>reformation. The character reappears in a rather different form as<br>Meagles in LITTLE DORRIT and John Jarndyce in BLEAK HOUSE--one might<br>perhaps add Betsy Trotwood in DAVID COPPERFIELD. But in these books the<br>good rich man has dwindled from a 'merchant' to a RENTIER. This is<br>significant. A RENTIER is part of the possessing class, he can and,<br>almost without knowing it, does make other people work for him, but he<br>has very little direct power. Unlike Scrooge or the Cheerybles, he cannot<br>put everything right by raising everybody's wages. The seeming inference<br>from the rather despondent books that Dickens wrote in the fifties is<br>that by that time he had grasped the helplessness of well-meaning<br>individuals in a corrupt society. Nevertheless in the last completed<br>novel, OUR MUTUAL FRIEND (published 1864-5), the good rich man comes back<br>in full glory in the person of Boffin. Boffin is a proletarian by origin<br>and only rich by inheritance, but he is the usual DEUS EX MACHINA,<br>solving everybody's problems by showering money in all directions. He<br>even 'trots', like the Cheerybles. In several ways OUR MUTUAL FRIEND is a<br>return to the earlier manner, and not an unsuccessful return either.<br>Dickens's thoughts seem to have come full circle. Once again, individual<br>kindliness is the remedy for everything.<br><br>One crying evil of his time that Dickens says very little about is child<br>labour. There are plenty of pictures of suffering children in his books,<br>but usually they are suffering in schools rather than in factories. The<br>one detailed account of child labour that he gives is the description in<br>DAVID COPPERFIELD of little David washing bottles in Murdstone & Grinby's<br>warehouse. This, of course, is autobiography. Dickens himself, at the age<br>of ten, had worked in Warren's blacking factory in the Strand, very much<br>as he describes it here. It was a terribly bitter memory to him, partly<br>because he felt the whole incident to be discreditable to his parents,<br>and he even concealed it from his wife till long after they were married.<br>Looking back on this period, he says in DAVID COPPERFIELD:<br><br><br>It is a matter of some surprise to me, even now, that I can have been so<br>easily thrown away at such an age. A child of excellent abilities and<br>with strong powers of observation, quick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt<br>bodily or mentally, it seems wonderful to me that nobody should have made<br>any sign in my behalf. But none was made; and I became, at ten years old,<br>a little labouring hind in the service of Murdstone & Grinby.<br><br><br>And again, having described the rough boys among whom he worked:<br><br><br>No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into this<br>companionship. . . and felt my hopes of growing up to be a learned and<br>distinguished man crushed in my bosom.<br><br><br>Obviously it is not David Copperfield who is speaking, it is Dickens<br>himself. He uses almost the same words in the autobiography that he began<br>and abandoned a few months earlier. Of course Dickens is right in saying<br>that a gifted child ought not to work ten hours a day pasting labels on<br>bottles, but what he does not say is that NO child ought to be condemned<br>to such a fate, and there is no reason for inferring that he thinks it.<br>David escapes from the warehouse, but Mick Walker and Mealy Potatoes and<br>the others are still there, and there is no sign that this troubles<br>Dickens particularly. As usual, he displays no consciousness that the<br>STRUCTURE of society can be changed. He despises politics, does not<br>believe that any good can come out of Parliament--he had been a<br>Parliamentary shorthand writer, which was no doubt a disillusioning<br>experience--and he is slightly hostile to the most hopeful movement of<br>his day, trade unionism. In HARD TIMES trade unionism is represented as<br>something not much better than a racket, something that happens because<br>employers are not sufficiently paternal. Stephen Blackpool's refusal to<br>join the union is rather a virtue in Dickens's eyes. Also, as Mr. Jackson<br>has pointed out, the apprentices' association in BARNABY RUDGE, to which<br>Sim Tappertit belongs, is probably a hit at the illegal or barely legal<br>unions of Dickens's own day, with their secret assemblies, passwords and<br>so forth. Obviously he wants the workers to be decently treated, but<br>there is no sign that he wants them to take their destiny into their own<br>hands, least of all by open violence.<br><br>As it happens, Dickens deals with revolution in the narrower sense in two<br>novels, BARNABY RUDGE and A TALE OF TWO CITIES. In BARNABY RUDGE it is a<br>case of rioting rather than revolution. The Gordon Riots of 1780, though<br>they had religious bigotry as a pretext, seem to have been little more<br>than a pointless outburst of looting. Dickens's attitude to this kind of<br>thing is sufficiently indicated by the fact that his first idea was to<br>make the ringleaders of the riots three lunatics escaped from an asylum.<br>He was dissuaded from this, but the principal figure of the book is in<br>fact a village idiot. In the chapters dealing with the riots Dickens<br>shows a most profound horror of mob violence. He delights in describing<br>scenes in which the 'dregs' of the population behave with atrocious<br>bestiality. These chapters are of great psychological interest, because<br>they show how deeply he had brooded on this subject. The things he<br>describes can only have come out of his imagination, for no riots on<br>anything like the same scale had happened in his lifetime. Here is one of<br>his descriptions, for instance:<br><br><br>If Bedlam gates had been flung open wide, there would not have issued<br>forth such maniacs as the frenzy of that night had made. There were men<br>there who danced and trampled on the beds of flowers as though they trod<br>down human enemies, and wrenched them from their stalks, like savages who<br>twisted human necks. There were men who cast their lighted torches in the<br>air, and suffered them to fall upon their heads and faces, blistering the<br>skin with deep unseemly burns. There were men who rushed up to the fire,<br>and paddled in it with their hands as if in water; and others who were<br>restrained by force from plunging in, to gratify their deadly longing. On<br>the skull of one drunken lad--not twenty, by his looks--who lay upon<br>the ground with a bottle to his mouth, the lead from the roof came<br>streaming down in a shower of liquid fire, white hot, melting his head<br>like wax. . . But of all the howling throng not one learnt mercy from, or<br>sickened at, these sights; nor was the fierce, besotted, senseless rage<br>of one man glutted.<br><br><br>You might almost think you were reading a description of 'Red' Spain by a<br>partisan of General Franco. One ought, of course, to remember that when<br>Dickens was writing, the London 'mob' still existed. (Nowadays there is<br>no mob, only a flock.) Low wages and the growth and shift of population<br>had brought into existence a huge, dangerous slum-proletariat, and until<br>the early middle of the nineteenth century there was hardly such a thing<br>as a police force. When the brickbats began to fly there was nothing<br>between shuttering your windows and ordering the troops to open fire. In<br>A TALE OF TWO CITIES he is dealing with a revolution which was really<br>about something, and Dickens's attitude is different, but not entirely<br>different. As a matter of fact, A TALE OF TWO CITIES is a book which<br>tends to leave a false impression behind, especially after a lapse of<br>time.<br><br>The one thing that everyone who has read A TALE OF TWO CITIES remembers<br>is the Reign of Terror. The whole book is dominated by the guillotine--<br>tumbrils thundering to and fro, bloody knives, heads bouncing into the<br>basket, and sinister old women knitting as they watch. Actually these<br>scenes only occupy a few chapters, but they are written with terrible<br>intensity, and the rest of the book is rather slow going. But A TALE OF<br>TWO CITIES is not a companion volume to THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. Dickens<br>sees clearly enough that the French Revolution was bound to happen and<br>that many of the people who were executed deserved what they got. If, he<br>says, you behave as the French aristocracy had behaved, vengeance will<br>follow. He repeats this over and over again. We are constantly being<br>reminded that while 'my lord' is lolling in bed, with four liveried<br>footmen serving his chocolate and the peasants starving outside,<br>somewhere in the forest a tree is growing which will presently be sawn<br>into planks for the platform of the guillotine, etc., etc., etc. The<br>inevitability of the Terror, given its causes, is insisted upon in the<br>clearest terms:<br><br><br>It was too much the way. . . to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it<br>were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown--<br>as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to<br>it--as if observers of the wretched millions in France, and of the<br>misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous,<br>had not seen it inevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain<br>terms recorded what they saw.<br><br><br>And again:<br><br><br>All the devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could<br>record itself, are fused in the one realization, Guillotine. And yet<br>there is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a<br>blade, a leaf, a root, a spring, a peppercorn, which will grow to<br>maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this<br>horror. Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and<br>it will twist itself into the same tortured forms.<br><br><br>In other words, the French aristocracy had dug their own graves. But<br>there is no perception here of what is now called historic necessity.<br>Dickens sees that the results are inevitable, given the causes, but he<br>thinks that the causes might have been avoided. The Revolution is<br>something that happens because centuries of oppression have made the<br>French peasantry sub-human. If the wicked nobleman could somehow have<br>turned over a new leaf, like Scrooge, there would have been no<br>Revolution, no JACQUERIE, no guillotine--and so much the better. This is<br>the opposite of the 'revolutionary' attitude. From the 'revolutionary'<br>point of view the class-struggle is the main source of progress, and<br>therefore the nobleman who robs the peasant and goads him to revolt is<br>playing a necessary part, just as much as the Jacobin who guillotines the<br>nobleman. Dickens never writes anywhere a line that can be interpreted as<br>meaning this. Revolution as he sees it is merely a monster that is<br>begotten by tyranny and always ends by devouring its own instruments. In<br>Sydney Carton's vision at the foot of the guillotine, he foresees Defarge<br>and the other leading spirits of the Terror all perishing under the same<br>knife--which, in fact, was approximately what happened.<br><br>And Dickens is very sure that revolution is a monster. That is why<br>everyone remembers the revolutionary scenes in A TALE OF TWO CITIES; they<br>have the quality of nightmare, and it is Dickens's own nightmare. Again<br>and again he insists upon the meaningless horrors of revolution--the<br>mass-butcheries, the injustice, the ever-present terror of spies, the<br>frightful blood-lust of the mob. The descriptions of the Paris mob--the<br>description, for instance, of the crowd of murderers struggling round the<br>grindstone to sharpen their weapons before butchering the prisoners in<br>the September massacres--outdo anything in BARNABY RUDGE. The<br>revolutionaries appear to him simply as degraded savages--in fact, as<br>lunatics. He broods over their frenzies with a curious imaginative<br>intensity. He describes them dancing the 'Carmagnole', for instance:<br><br><br>There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were dancing<br>like five thousand demons. . . They danced to the popular Revolution song,<br>keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. . .<br>They advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one<br>another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another, and spun around in<br>pairs, until many of them dropped. . . Suddenly they stopped again, paused,<br>struck out the time afresh, forming into lines the width of the public<br>way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped<br>screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance.<br>It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once innocent,<br>delivered over to all devilry.<br><br><br>He even credits some of these wretches with a taste for guillotining<br>children. The passage I have abridged above ought to be read in full. It<br>and others like it show how deep was Dickens's horror of revolutionary<br>hysteria. Notice, for instance that touch, 'with their heads low down and<br>their hands high up', etc., and the evil vision it conveys. Madame<br>Defarge is a truly dreadful figure, certainly Dickens's most successful<br>attempt at a MALIGNANT character. Defarge and others are simply 'the new<br>oppressors who have risen in the destruction of the old', the<br>revolutionary courts are presided over by 'the lowest, cruellest and<br>worst populace', and so on and so forth. All the way through Dickens<br>insists upon the nightmare insecurity of a revolutionary period, and in<br>this he shows a great deal of prescience. 'A law of the suspected, which<br>struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good<br>and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people<br>who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing'--it would<br>apply pretty accurately to several countries today.<br><br>The apologists of any revolution generally try to minimize its horrors;<br>Dickens's impulse is to exaggerate them--and from a historical point of<br>view he has certainly exaggerated. Even the Reign of Terror was a much<br>smaller thing than he makes it appear. Though he quotes no figures, he<br>gives the impression of a frenzied massacre lasting for years, whereas in<br>reality the whole of the Terror, so far as the number of deaths goes, was<br>a joke compared with one of Napoleon's battles. But the bloody knives and<br>the tumbrils rolling to and fro create in his mind a special sinister<br>vision which he has succeeded in passing on to generations of readers.<br>Thanks to Dickens, the very word 'tumbril' has a murderous sound; one<br>forgets that a tumbril is only a sort of farm-cart. To this day, to the<br>average Englishman, the French Revolution means no more than a pyramid of<br>severed heads. It is a strange thing that Dickens, much more in sympathy<br>with the ideas of the Revolution than most Englishmen of his time, should<br>have played a part in creating this impression.<br><br>If you hate violence and don't believe in politics, the only remedy<br>remaining is education. Perhaps society is past praying for, but there is<br>always hope for the individual human being, if you can catch him young<br>enough. This belief partly accounts for Dickens's preoccupation with<br>childhood.<br><br>No one, at any rate no English writer, has written better about childhood<br>than Dickens. In spite of all the knowledge that has accumulated since,<br>in spite of the fact that children are now comparatively sanely treated,<br>no novelist has shown the same power of entering into the child's point<br>of view. I must have been about nine years old when I first read DAVID<br>COPPERFIELD. The mental atmosphere of the opening chapters was so<br>immediately intelligible to me that I vaguely imagined they had been<br>written BY A CHILD. And yet when one re-reads the book as an adult and<br>sees the Murdstones, for instance, dwindle from gigantic figures of doom<br>into semi-comic monsters, these passages lose nothing. Dickens has been<br>able to stand both inside and outside the child's mind, in such a way<br>that the same scene can be wild burlesque or sinister reality, according<br>to the age at which one reads it. Look, for instance, at the scene in<br>which David Copperfield is unjustly suspected of eating the mutton chops;<br>or the scene in which Pip, in GREAT EXPECTATIONS, coming back from Miss<br>Havisham's house and finding himself completely unable to describe what<br>he has seen, takes refuge in a series of outrageous lies--which, of<br>course, are eagerly believed. All the isolation of childhood is there.<br>And how accurately he has recorded the mechanisms of the child's mind,<br>its visualizing tendency, its sensitiveness to certain kinds of<br>impression. Pip relates how in his childhood his ideas about his dead<br>parents were derived from their tombstones:<br><br><br>The shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an odd idea that he was<br>a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and<br>turn of the inscription, 'ALSO GEORGIANA, WIFE OF THE ABOVE', I drew a<br>childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five<br>little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were<br>arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory<br>of five little brothers of mine. . . I am indebted for a belief I<br>religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with<br>their hands in their trouser-pockets, and had never taken them out in<br>this state of existence.<br><br><br>There is a similar passage in DAVID COPPERFIELD. After biting Mr.<br>Murdstone's hand, David is sent away to school and obliged to wear on his<br>back a placard saying, 'Take care of him. He bites.' He looks at the door<br>in the playground where the boys have carved their names, and from the<br>appearance of each name he seems to know in just what tone of voice the<br>boy will read out the placard:<br><br><br>There was one boy--a certain J. Steerforth--who cut his name very deep<br>and very often, who, I conceived, would read it in a rather strong voice,<br>and afterwards pull my hair. There was another boy, one Tommy Traddles,<br>who I dreaded would make game of it, and pretend to be dreadfully<br>frightened of me. There was a third, George Demple, who I fancied would<br>sing it.<br><br><br>When I read this passage as a child, it seemed to me that those were<br>exactly the pictures that those particular names would call up. The<br>reason, of course, is the sound-associations of the words (Demple--<br>'temple'; Traddles--probably 'skedaddle'). But how many people, before<br>Dickens, had ever noticed such things? A sympathetic attitude towards<br>children was a much rarer thing in Dickens's day than it is now. The<br>early nineteenth century was not a good time to be a child. In Dickens's<br>youth children were still being 'solemnly tried at a criminal bar, where<br>they were held up to be seen', and it was not so long since boys of<br>thirteen had been hanged for petty theft. The doctrine of 'breaking the<br>child's spirit' was in full vigour, and THE FAIRCHILD FAMILY was a<br>standard book for children till late into the century. This evil book is<br>now issued in pretty-pretty expurgated editions, but it is well worth<br>reading in the original version. It gives one some idea of the lengths to<br>which child-discipline was sometimes carried. Mr. Fairchild, for<br>instance, when he catches his children quarrelling, first thrashes them,<br>reciting Dr. Watts's 'Let dogs delight to bark and bite' between blows of<br>the cane, and then takes them to spend the afternoon beneath a gibbet<br>where the rotting corpse of a murderer is hanging. In the earlier part of<br>the century scores of thousands of children, aged sometimes as young as<br>six, were literally worked to death in the mines or cotton mills, and<br>even at the fashionable public schools boys were flogged till they ran<br>with blood for a mistake in their Latin verses. One thing which Dickens<br>seems to have recognized, and which most of his contemporaries did not,<br>is the sadistic sexual element in flogging. I think this can be inferred<br>from DAVID COPPERFIELD and NICHOLAS NICKLEBY. But mental cruelty to a<br>child infuriates him as much as physical, and though there is a fair<br>number of exceptions, his schoolmasters are generally scoundrels.<br><br>Except for the universities and the big public schools, every kind of<br>education then existing in England gets a mauling at Dickens's hands.<br>There is Doctor Blimber's Academy, where little boys are blown up with<br>Greek until they burst, and the revolting charity schools of the period,<br>which produced specimens like Noah Claypole and Uriah Heep, and Salem<br>House, and Dotheboys Hall, and the disgraceful little dame-school kept by<br>Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt. Some of what Dickens says remains true even<br>today. Salem House is the ancestor of the modern 'prep school', which<br>still has a good deal of resemblance to it; and as for Mr. Wopsle's<br>great-aunt, some old fraud of much the same stamp is carrying on at this<br>moment in nearly every small town in England. But, as usual, Dickens's<br>criticism is neither creative nor destructive. He sees the idiocy of an<br>educational system founded on the Greek lexicon and the wax-ended cane;<br>on the other hand, he has no use for the new kind of school that is<br>coming up in the fifties and sixties, the 'modern' school, with its<br>gritty insistence on 'facts'. What, then, DOES he want? As always, what<br>he appears to want is a moralized version of the existing thing--the old<br>type of school, but with no caning, no bullying or underfeeding, and not<br>quite so much Greek. Doctor Strong's school, to which David Copperfield<br>goes after he escapes from Murdstone & Grinby's, is simply Salem House<br>with the vices left out and a good deal of 'old grey stones' atmosphere<br>thrown in:<br><br><br>Doctor Strong's was an excellent school, as different from Mr. Creakle's<br>as good is from evil. It was very gravely and decorously ordered, and on<br>a sound system; with an appeal, in everything, to the honour and good<br>faith of the boys. . . which worked wonders. We all felt that we had a part<br>in the management of the place, and in sustaining its character and<br>dignity. Hence, we soon became warmly attached to it--I am sure I did<br>for one, and I never knew, in all my time, of any boy being otherwise--<br>and learnt with a good will, desiring to do it credit. We had noble games<br>out of hours, and plenty of liberty; but even then, as I remember, we<br>were well spoken of in the town, and rarely did any disgrace, by our<br>appearance or manner, to the reputation of Doctor Strong and Doctor<br>Strong's boys.<br><br><br>In the woolly vagueness of this passage one can see Dickens's utter lack<br>of any educational theory. He can imagine the MORAL atmosphere of a good<br>school, but nothing further. The boys 'learnt with a good will', but what<br>did they learn? No doubt it was Doctor Blimber's curriculum, a little<br>watered down. Considering the attitude to society that is everywhere<br>implied in Dickens's novels, it comes as rather a shock to learn that he<br>sent his eldest son to Eton and sent all his children through the<br>ordinary educational mill. Gissing seems to think that he may have done<br>this because he was painfully conscious of being under-educated himself.<br>Here perhaps Gissing is influenced by his own love of classical learning.<br>Dickens had had little or no formal education, but he lost nothing by<br>missing it, and on the whole he seems to have been aware of this. If he<br>was unable to imagine a better school than Doctor Strong's, or, in real<br>life, than Eton, it was probably due to an intellectual deficiency rather<br>different from the one Gissing suggests.<br><br>It seems that in every attack Dickens makes upon society he is always<br>pointing to a change of spirit rather than a change of structure. It is<br>hopeless to try and pin him down to any definite remedy, still more to<br>any political doctrine. His approach is always along the moral plane, and<br>his attitude is sufficiently summed up in that remark about Strong's<br>school being as different from Creakle's 'as good is from evil'. Two<br>things can be very much alike and yet abysmally different. Heaven and<br>Hell are in the same place. Useless to change institutions without a<br>'change of heart'--that, essentially, is what he is always saying.<br><br>If that were all, he might be no more than a cheer-up writer, a<br>reactionary humbug. A 'change of heart' is in fact THE alibi of people<br>who do not wish to endanger the STATUS QUO. But Dickens is not a humbug,<br>except in minor matters, and the strongest single impression one carries<br>away from his books is that of a hatred of tyranny. I said earlier that<br>Dickens is not IN THE ACCEPTED SENSE a revolutionary writer. But it is<br>not at all certain that a merely moral criticism of society may not be<br>just as 'revolutionary'--and revolution, after all, means turning things<br>upside down--as the politico-economic criticism which is fashionable at<br>this moment. Blake was not a politician, but there is more understanding<br>of the nature of capitalist society in a poem like 'I wander through each<br>charted street' than in three-quarters of Socialist literature. Progress<br>is not an illusion, it happens, but it is slow and invariably<br>disappointing. There is always a new tyrant waiting to take over from the<br>old--generally not quite so bad, but still a tyrant. Consequently two<br>viewpoints are always tenable. The one, how can you improve human nature<br>until you have changed the system? The other, what is the use of changing<br>the system before you have improved human nature? They appeal to<br>different individuals, and they probably show a tendency to alternate in<br>point of time. The moralist and the revolutionary are constantly<br>undermining one another. Marx exploded a hundred tons of dynamite beneath<br>the moralist position, and we are still living in the echo of that<br>tremendous crash. But already, somewhere or other, the sappers are at<br>work and fresh dynamite is being tamped in place to blow Marx at the<br>moon. Then Marx, or somebody like him, will come back with yet more<br>dynamite, and so the process continues, to an end we cannot yet foresee.<br>The central problem--how to prevent power from being abused--remains<br>unsolved. Dickens, who had not the vision to see that private property is<br>an obstructive nuisance, had the vision to see that. 'If men would behave<br>decently the world would be decent' is not such a platitude as it sounds.<br><br><br>II<br><br><br>More completely than most writers, perhaps, Dickens can be explained in<br>terms of his social origin, though actually his family history was not<br>quite what one would infer from his novels. His father was a clerk in<br>government service, and through his mother's family he had connexions<br>with both the Army and the Navy. But from the age of nine onwards he was<br>brought up in London in commercial surroundings, and generally in an<br>atmosphere of struggling poverty. Mentally he belongs to the small urban<br>bourgeoisie, and he happens to be an exceptionally fine specimen of this<br>class, with all the 'points', as it were, very highly developed. That is<br>partly what makes him so interesting. If one wants a modern equivalent,<br>the nearest would be H. G. Wells, who has had a rather similar history<br>and who obviously owes something to Dickens as novelist. Arnold Bennett<br>was essentially of the same type, but, unlike the other two, he was a<br>midlander, with an industrial and noncomformist rather than commercial<br>and Anglican background.<br><br>The great disadvantage, and advantage, of the small urban bourgeois is<br>his limited outlook. He sees the world as a middle-class world, and<br>everything outside these limits is either laughable or slightly wicked.<br>On the one hand, he has no contact with industry or the soil; on the<br>other, no contact with the governing classes. Anyone who has studied<br>Wells's novels in detail will have noticed that though he hates the<br>aristocrat like poison, he has no particular objection to the plutocrat,<br>and no enthusiasm for the proletarian. His most hated types, the people<br>he believes to be responsible for all human ills, are kings, landowners,<br>priests, nationalists, soldiers, scholars and peasants. At first sight a<br>list beginning with kings and ending with peasants looks like a mere<br>omnium gatherum, but in reality all these people have a common factor.<br>All of them are archaic types, people who are governed by tradition and<br>whose eyes are turned towards the past--the opposite, therefore, of the<br>rising bourgeois who has put his money on the future and sees the past<br>simply as a dead hand.<br><br>Actually, although Dickens lived in a period when the bourgeoisie was<br>really a rising class, he displays this characteristic less strongly than<br>Wells. He is almost unconscious of the future and has a rather sloppy<br>love of the picturesque (the 'quaint old church', etc.). Nevertheless his<br>list of most hated types is like enough to Wells's for the similarity to<br>be striking. He is vaguely on the side of the working class--has a sort<br>of generalized sympathy with them because they are oppressed--but he<br>does not in reality know much about them; they come into his books<br>chiefly as servants, and comic servants at that. At the other end of the<br>scale he loathes the aristocrat and--going one better than Wells in this<br>loathes the big bourgeois as well. His real sympathies are bounded by Mr.<br>Pickwick on the upper side and Mr. Barkis on the lower. But the term<br>'aristocrat', for the type Dickens hates, is vague and needs defining.<br><br>Actually Dickens's target is not so much the great aristocracy, who<br>hardly enter into his books, as their petty offshoots, the cadging<br>dowagers who live up mews in Mayfair, and the bureaucrats and<br>professional soldiers. All through his books there are countess hostile<br>sketches of these people, and hardly any that are friendly. There are<br>practically no friendly pictures of the landowning class, for instance.<br>One might make a doubtful exception of Sir Leicester Dedlock; otherwise<br>there is only Mr. Wardle (who is a stock figure the 'good old squire')<br>and Haredale in BARNABY RUDGE, who has Dickens's sympathy because he is a<br>persecuted Catholic. There are no friendly pictures of soldiers (i.e.<br>officers), and none at all of naval men. As for his bureaucrats, judges<br>and magistrates, most of them would feel quite at home in the<br>Circumlocution Office. The only officials whom Dickens handles with any<br>kind of friendliness are, significantly enough, policemen.<br><br>Dickens's attitude is easily intelligible to an Englishman, because it is<br>part of the English puritan tradition, which is not dead even at this<br>day. The class Dickens belonged to, at least by adoption, was growing<br>suddenly rich after a couple of centuries of obscurity. It had grown up<br>mainly in the big towns, out of contact with agriculture, and politically<br>impotent; government, in its experience, was something which either<br>interfered or persecuted. Consequently it was a class with no tradition<br>of public service and not much tradition of usefulness. What now strikes<br>us as remarkable about the new moneyed class of the nineteenth century is<br>their complete irresponsibility; they see everything in terms of<br>individual success, with hardly any consciousness that the community<br>exists. On the other hand, a Tite Barnacle, even when he was neglecting<br>his duties, would have some vague notion of what duties he was<br>neglecting. Dickens's attitude is never irresponsible, still less does he<br>take the money-grubbing Smilesian line; but at the back of his mind there<br>is usually a half-belief that the whole apparatus of government is<br>unnecessary. Parliament is simply Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle, the<br>Empire is simply Major Bagstock and his Indian servant, the Army is<br>simply Colonel Chowser and Doctor Slammer, the public services are simply<br>Bumble and the Circumlocution Office--and so on and so forth. What he<br>does not see, or only intermittently sees, is that Coodle and Doodle and<br>all the other corpses left over from the eighteenth century ARE<br>performing a function which neither Pickwick nor Boffin would ever bother<br>about.<br><br>And of course this narrowness of vision is in one way a great advantage<br>to him, because it is fatal for a caricaturist to see too much. From<br>Dickens's point of view 'good' society is simply a collection of village<br>idiots. What a crew! Lady Tippins! Mrs. Gowan! Lord Verisopht! The<br>Honourable Bob Stables! Mrs. Sparsit (whose husband was a Powler)! The<br>Tite Barnacles! Nupkins! It is practically a case-book in lunacy. But at<br>the same time his remoteness from the landowning-military-bureaucratic<br>class incapacitates him for full-length satire. He only succeeds with<br>this class when he depicts them as mental defectives. The accusation<br>which used to be made against Dickens in his lifetime, that he 'could not<br>paint a gentleman', was an absurdity, but it is true in this sense, that<br>what he says against the 'gentleman' class is seldom very damaging. Sir<br>Mulberry Hawk, for instance, is a wretched attempt at the wicked-baronet<br>type. Harthouse in HARD TIMES is better, but he would be only an ordinary<br>achievement for Trollope or Thackeray. Trollope's thoughts hardly move<br>outside the 'gentleman' class, but Thackeray has the great advantage of<br>having a foot in two moral camps. In some ways his outlook is very<br>similar to Dickens's. Like Dickens, he identifies with the puritanical<br>moneyed class against the card-playing, debt-bilking aristocracy. The<br>eighteenth century, as he sees it, is sticking out into the nineteenth in<br>the person of the wicked Lord Steyne. VANITY FAIR is a full-length<br>version of what Dickens did for a few chapters in LITTLE DORRIT. But by<br>origins and upbringing Thackeray happens to be somewhat nearer to the<br>class he is satirizing. Consequently he can produce such comparatively<br>subtle types as, for instance, Major Pendennis and Rawdon Crawley. Major<br>Pendennis is a shallow old snob, and Rawdon Crawley is a thick-headed<br>ruffian who sees nothing wrong in living for years by swindling<br>tradesmen; but what Thackery realizes is that according to their tortuous<br>code they are neither of them bad men. Major Pendennis would not sign a<br>dud cheque, for instance; Rawdon certainly would, but on the other hand<br>he would not desert a friend in a tight corner. Both of them would behave<br>well on the field of battle--a thing that would not particularly appeal<br>to Dickens. The result is that at the end one is left with a kind of<br>amused tolerance for Major Pendennis and with something approaching<br>respect for Rawdon; and yet one sees, better than any diatribe could make<br>one, the utter rottenness of that kind of cadging, toadying life on the<br>fringes of smart society. Dickens would be quite incapable of this. In<br>his hands both Rawdon and the Major would dwindle to traditional<br>caricatures. And, on the whole, his attacks on 'good' society are rather<br>perfunctory. The aristocracy and the big bourgeoisie exist in his books<br>chiefly as a kind of 'noises off', a haw-hawing chorus somewhere in the<br>wings, like Podsnap's dinner-parties. When he produces a really subtle<br>and damaging portrait, like John Dorrit or Harold Skimpole, it is<br>generally of some rather middling, unimportant person.<br><br>One very striking thing about Dickens, especially considering the time he<br>lived in, is his lack of vulgar nationalism. All peoples who have reached<br>the point of becoming nations tend to despise foreigners, but there is<br>not much doubt that the English-speaking races are the worst offenders.<br>One can see this from the fact that as soon as they become fully aware of<br>any foreign race they invent an insulting nickname for it. Wop, Dago,<br>Froggy, Squarehead, Kike, Sheeny, Nigger, Wog, Chink, Greaser,<br>Yellowbelly--these are merely a selection. Any time before 1870 the list<br>would have been shorter, because the map of the world was different from<br>what it is now, and there were only three or four foreign races that had<br>fully entered into the English consciousness. But towards these, and<br>especially towards France, the nearest and best-hated nation, the English<br>attitude of patronage was so intolerable that English 'arrogance' and<br>'xenophobia' are still a legend. And of course they are not a completely<br>untrue legend even now. Till very recently nearly all English children<br>were brought up to despise the southern European races, and history as<br>taught in schools was mainly a list of battles won by England. But one<br>has got to read, say, the QUARTERLY REVIEW of the thirties to know what<br>boasting really is. Those were the days when the English built up their<br>legend of themselves as 'sturdy islanders' and 'stubborn hearts of oak'<br>and when it was accepted as a kind of scientific fact that one Englishman<br>was the equal of three foreigners. All through nineteenth-century novels<br>and comic papers there runs the traditional figure of the 'Froggy'--a<br>small ridiculous man with a tiny beard and a pointed top-hat, always<br>jabbering and gesticulating, vain, frivolous and fond of boasting of his<br>martial exploits, but generally taking to flight when real danger<br>appears. Over against him was John Bull, the 'sturdy English yeoman', or<br>(a more public-school version) the 'strong, silent Englishman' of Charles<br>Kingsley, Tom Hughes and others.<br><br>Thackeray, for instance, has this outlook very strongly, though there are<br>moments when he sees through it and laughs at it. The one historical fact<br>that is firmly fixed in his mind is that the English won the battle of<br>Waterloo. One never reads far in his books without coming upon some<br>reference to it. The English, as he sees it, are invincible because of<br>their tremendous physical strength, due mainly to living on beef. Like<br>most Englishmen of his time, he has the curious illusion that the English<br>are larger than other people (Thackeray, as it happened, was larger than<br>most people), and therefore he is capable of writing passages like this:<br><br><br>I say to you that you are better than a Frenchman. I would lay even money<br>that you who are reading this are more than five feet seven in height,<br>and weigh eleven stone; while a Frenchman is five feet four and does not<br>weigh nine. The Frenchman has after his soup a dish of vegetables, where<br>you have one of meat. You are a different and superior animal--a<br>French-beating animal (the history of hundreds of years has shown you to<br>be so), etc. etc.<br><br><br>There are similar passages scattered all through Thackeray's works.<br>Dickens would never be guilty of anything of that kind. It would be an<br>exaggeration to say that he nowhere pokes fun at foreigners, and of<br>course like nearly all nineteenth-century Englishmen, he is untouched by<br>European culture. But never anywhere does he indulge in the typical<br>English boasting, the 'island race', 'bulldog breed', 'right little,<br>tight little island' style of talk. In the whole of A TALE OF TWO CITIES<br>there is not a line that could be taken as meaning, 'Look how these<br>wicked Frenchmen behave!' The only place where he seems to display a<br>normal hatred of foreigners is in the American chapters of MARTIN<br>CHUZZLEWIT. This, however, is simply the reaction of a generous mind<br>against cant. If Dickens were alive today he would make a trip to Soviet<br>Russia and come back to the book rather like Gide's RETOUR DE L'URSS. But<br>he is remarkably free from the idiocy of regarding nations as<br>individuals. He seldom even makes jokes turning on nationality. He does<br>not exploit the comic Irishman and the comic Welshman, for instance, and<br>not because he objects to stock characters and ready-made jokes, which<br>obviously he does not. It is perhaps more significant that he shows no<br>prejudice against Jews. It is true that he takes it for granted (OLIVER<br>TWIST and GREAT EXPECTATIONS) that a receiver of stolen goods will be a<br>Jew, which at the time was probably justified. But the 'Jew joke',<br>endemic in English literature until the rise of Hitler, does not appear<br>in his books, and in OUR MUTUAL FRIEND he makes a pious though not very<br>convincing attempt to stand up for the Jews.<br><br>Dickens's lack of vulgar nationalism is in part the mark of a real<br>largeness of mind, and in part results from his negative, rather<br>unhelpful political attitude. He is very much an Englishman but he is<br>hardly aware of it--certainly the thought of being an Englishman does<br>not thrill him. He has no imperialist feelings, no discernible views on<br>foreign politics, and is untouched by the military tradition.<br>Temperamentally he is much nearer to the small noncomformist tradesman<br>who looks down on the 'redcoats', and thinks that war is wicked--a<br>one-eyed view, but after all, war is wicked. It is noticeable that<br>Dickens hardly writes of war, even to denounce it. With all his<br>marvellous powers of description, and of describing things he had never<br>seen, he never describes a battle, unless one counts the attack on the<br>Bastille in A TALE OF TWO CITIES. Probably the subject would not strike<br>him as interesting, and in any case he would not regard a battlefield as<br>a place where anything worth settling could be settled. It is one up to<br>the lower-middle-class, puritan mentality.<br><br><br>III<br><br><br>Dickens had grown up near enough to poverty to be terrified of it, and in<br>spite of his generosity of mind, he is not free from the special<br>prejudices of the shabby-genteel. It is usual to claim him as a 'popular'<br>writer, a champion of the 'oppressed masses'. So he is, so long as he<br>thinks of them as oppressed; but there are two things that condition his<br>attitude. In the first place, he is a south-of-England man, and a Cockney<br>at that, and therefore out of touch with the bulk of the real oppressed<br>masses, the industrial and agricultural labourers. It is interesting to<br>see how Chesterton, another Cockney, always presents Dickens as the<br>spokesman of 'the poor', without showing much awareness of who 'the poor'<br>really are. To Chesterton 'the poor' means small shopkeepers and<br>servants. Sam Weller, he says, 'is the great symbol in English literature<br>of the populace peculiar to England'; and Sam Weller is a valet! The<br>other point is that Dickens's early experiences have given him a horror<br>of proletarian roughness. He shows this unmistakably whenever he writes<br>of the very poorest of the poor, the slum-dwellers. His descriptions of<br>the London slums are always full of undisguised repulsion:<br><br><br>The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; and people<br>half naked, drunken, slipshod and ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many<br>cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon<br>the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, and<br>filth, and misery, etc. etc.<br><br><br>There are many similar passages in Dickens. From them one gets the<br>impression of whole submerged populations whom he regards as being beyond<br>the pale. In rather the same way the modern doctrinaire Socialist<br>contemptuously writes off a large block of the population as<br>'lumpenproletariat'.<br><br>Dickens also shows less understanding of criminals than one would expect<br>of him. Although he is well aware of the social and economic causes of<br>crime, he often seems to feel that when a man has once broken the law he<br>has put himself outside human society. There is a chapter at the end of<br>DAVID COPPERFIELD in which David visits the prison where Latimer and<br>Uriah Heep are serving their sentences. Dickens actually seems to regard<br>the horrible 'model' prisons, against which Charles Reade delivered his<br>memorable attack in IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND, as too humane. He<br>complains that the food is too good! As soon as he comes up against crime<br>or the worst depths of poverty, he shows traces of the 'I've always kept<br>myself respectable' habit of mind. The attitude of Pip (obviously the<br>attitude of Dickens himself) towards Magwitch in GREAT EXPECTATIONS is<br>extremely interesting. Pip is conscious all along of his ingratitude<br>towards Joe, but far less so of his ingratitude towards Magwitch. When he<br>discovers that the person who has loaded him with benefits for years is<br>actually a transported convict, he falls into frenzies of disgust. 'The<br>abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the<br>repugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if<br>he had been some terrible beast', etc. etc. So far as one can discover<br>from the text, this is not because when Pip was a child he had been<br>terrorized by Magwitch in the churchyard; it is because Magwitch is a<br>criminal and a convict. There is an even more 'kept-myself-respectable'<br>touch in the fact that Pip feels as a matter of course that he cannot<br>take Magwitch's money. The money is not the product of a crime, it has<br>been honestly acquired; but it is an ex-convict's money and therefore<br>'tainted'. There is nothing psychologically false in this, either.<br>Psychologically the latter part of GREAT EXPECTATIONS is about the best<br>thing Dickens ever did; throughout this part of the book one feels 'Yes,<br>that is just how Pip would have behaved.' But the point is that in the<br>matter of Magwitch, Dickens identifies with Pip, and his attitude is at<br>bottom snobbish. The result is that Magwitch belongs to the same queer<br>class of characters as Falstaff and, probably, Don Quixote--characters<br>who are more pathetic than the author intended.<br><br>When it is a question of the non-criminal poor, the ordinary, decent,<br>labouring poor, there is of course nothing contemptuous in Dickens's<br>attitude. He has the sincerest admiration for people like the Peggottys<br>and the Plornishes. But it is questionable whether he really regards them<br>as equals. It is of the greatest interest to read Chapter XI of DAVID<br>COPPERFIELD and side by side with it the autobiographical fragments<br>(parts of this are given in Forster's LIFE), in which Dickens expresses<br>his feelings about the blacking-factory episode a great deal more<br>strongly than in the novel. For more than twenty years afterwards the<br>memory was so painful to him that he would go out of his way to avoid<br>that part of the Strand. He says that to pass that way 'made me cry,<br>after my eldest child could speak.' The text makes it quite clear that<br>what hurt him most of all, then and in retrospect, was the enforced<br>contact with 'low' associates:<br><br><br>No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into this<br>companionship; compared these everyday associates with those of my<br>happier childhood. But I held some station at the blacking warehouse<br>too. . . I soon became at least as expeditious and as skilful with my hands<br>as either of the other boys. Though perfectly familiar with them, my<br>conduct and manners were different enough from theirs to place a space<br>between us. They, and the men, always spoke of me as 'the young<br>gentleman'. A certain man. . . used to call me 'Charles' sometimes in<br>speaking to me; but I think it was mostly when we were very<br>confidential. . . Poll Green uprose once, and rebelled against the<br>'young-gentleman' usage; but Bob Fagin settled him speedily.<br><br><br>It was as well that there should be 'a space between us', you see.<br>However much Dickens may admire the working classes, he does not wish to<br>resemble them. Given his origins, and the time he lived in, it could<br>hardly be otherwise. In the early nineteenth century class animosities<br>may have been no sharper than they are now, but the surface differences<br>between class and class were enormously greater. The 'gentleman' and the<br>'common man' must have seemed like different species of animal. Dickens<br>is quite genuinely on the side of the poor against the rich, but it would<br>be next door to impossible for him not to think of a working-class<br>exterior as a stigma. In one of Tolstoy's fables the peasants of a<br>certain village judge every stranger who arrives from the state of his<br>hands. If his palms are hard from work, they let him in; if his palms are<br>soft, out he goes. This would be hardly intelligible to Dickens; all his<br>heroes have soft hands. His younger heroes--Nicholas Nickleby, Martin<br>Chuzzlewit, Edward Chester, David Copperfield, John Harmon--are usually<br>of the type known as 'walking gentlemen'. He likes a bourgeois exterior<br>and a bourgeois (not aristocratic) accent. One curious symptom of this is<br>that he will not allow anyone who is to play a heroic part to speak like<br>a working man. A comic hero like Sam Weller, or a merely pathetic figure<br>like Stephen Blackpool, can speak with a broad accent, but the JEUNE<br>PREMIER always speaks the equivalent of B.B.C. This is so, even when it<br>involves absurdities. Little Pip, for instance, is brought up by people<br>speaking broad Essex, but talks upper-class English from his earliest<br>childhood; actually he would have talked the same dialect as Joe, or at<br>least as Mrs. Gargery. So also with Biddy Wopsle, Lizzie Hexam, Sissie<br>Jupe, Oliver Twist--one ought perhaps to add Little Dorrit. Even Rachel<br>in HARD TIMES has barely a trace of Lancashire accent, an impossibility<br>in her case.<br><br>One thing that often gives the clue to a novelist's real feelings on the<br>class question is the attitude he takes up when class collides with sex.<br>This is a thing too painful to be lied about, and consequently it is one<br>of the points at which the 'I'm-not-a-snob' pose tends to break down.<br><br>One sees that at its most obvious where a class-distinction is also a<br>colour-distinction. And something resembling the colonial attitude<br>('native' women are fair game, white women are sacrosanct) exists in a<br>veiled form in all-white communities, causing bitter resentment on both<br>sides. When this issue arises, novelists often revert to crude<br>class-feelings which they might disclaim at other times. A good example<br>of 'class-conscious' reaction is a rather forgotten novel, THE PEOPLE OF<br>CLOPTON, by Andrew Barton. The author's moral code is quite clearly mixed<br>up with class-hatred. He feels the seduction of a poor girl by a rich man<br>to be something atrocious, a kind of defilement, something quite<br>different from her seduction by a man in her own walk of life. Trollope<br>deals with this theme twice (THE THREE CLERKS and THE SMALL HOUSE AT<br>ALLINGTON) and, as one might expect, entirely from the upper-class angle.<br>As he sees it, an affair with a barmaid or a landlady's daughter is<br>simply an 'entanglement' to be escaped from. Trollope's moral standards<br>are strict, and he does not allow the seduction actually to happen, but<br>the implication is always that a working-class girl's feelings do not<br>greatly matter. In THE THREE CLERKS he even gives the typical<br>class-reaction by noting that the girl 'smells'. Meredith (RHODA FLEMING)<br>takes more the 'class-conscious' viewpoint. Thackeray, as often, seems to<br>hesitate. In PENDENNIS (Fanny Bolton) his attitude is much the same as<br>Trollope's; in A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY it is nearer to Meredith's.<br><br>One could divine a great deal about Trollope's social origin, or<br>Meredith's, or Barton's, merely from their handling of the class-sex<br>theme. So one can with Dickens, but what emerges, as usual, is that he is<br>more inclined to identify himself with the middle class than with the<br>proletariat. The one incident that seems to contradict this is the tale<br>of the young peasant-girl in Doctor Manette's manuscript in A TALE OF TWO<br>CITIES. This, however, is merely a costume-piece put in to explain the<br>implacable hatred of Madame Defarge, which Dickens does not pretend to<br>approve of. In DAVID COPPERFIELD, where he is dealing with a typical<br>nineteenth-century seduction, the class-issue does not seem to strike him<br>as paramount. It is a law of Victorian novels that sexual misdeeds must<br>not go unpunished, and so Steerforth is drowned on Yarmouth sands, but<br>neither Dickens<br><br></font></p>
