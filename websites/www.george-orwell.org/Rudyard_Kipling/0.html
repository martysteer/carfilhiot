<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">It was a pity that Mr. Eliot should be so much on the defensive in the<br>long essay with which he prefaces this selection of Kipling's poetry,<br>but it was not to be avoided, because before one can even speak about<br>Kipling one has to clear away a legend that has been created by two sets<br>of people who have not read his works. Kipling is in the peculiar<br>position of having been a byword for fifty years. During five literary<br>generations every enlightened person has despised him, and at the end of<br>that time nine-tenths of those enlightened persons are forgotten and<br>Kipling is in some sense still there. Mr. Eliot never satisfactorily<br>explains this fact, because in answering the shallow and familiar charge<br>that Kipling is a 'Fascist', he falls into the opposite error of<br>defending him where he is not defensible. It is no use pretending that<br>Kipling's view of life, as a whole, can be accepted or even forgiven by<br>any civilized person. It is no use claiming, for instance, that when<br>Kipling describes a British soldier beating a 'nigger' with a cleaning<br>rod in order to get money out of him, he is acting merely as a reporter<br>and does not necessarily approve what he describes. There is not the<br>slightest sign anywhere in Kipling's work that he disapproves of that<br>kind of conduct--on the contrary, there is a definite strain of sadism<br>in him, over and above the brutality which a writer of that type has to<br>have. Kipling is a jingo imperialist, he is morally insensitive and<br>aesthetically disgusting. It is better to start by admitting that, and<br>then to try to find out why it is that he survives while the refined<br>people who have sniggered at him seem to wear so badly.<br><br>And yet the 'Fascist' charge has to be answered, because the first clue<br>to any understanding of Kipling, morally or politically, is the fact that<br>he was NOT a Fascist. He was further from being one than the most humane<br>or the most 'progressive' person is able to be nowadays. An interesting<br>instance of the way in which quotations are parroted to and fro without<br>any attempt to look up their context or discover their meaning is the<br>line from 'Recessional', 'Lesser breeds without the Law'. This line is<br>always good for a snigger in pansy-left circles. It is assumed as a<br>matter of course that the 'lesser breeds' are 'natives', and a mental<br>picture is called up of some pukka sahib in a pith helmet kicking a<br>coolie. In its context the sense of the line is almost the exact opposite<br>of this. The phrase 'lesser breeds' refers almost certainly to the<br>Germans, and especially the pan-German writers, who are 'without the Law'<br>in the sense of being lawless, not in the sense of being powerless. The<br>whole poem, conventionally thought of as an orgy of boasting, is a<br>denunciation of power politics, British as well as German. Two stanzas<br>are worth quoting (I am quoting this as politics, not as poetry):<br><br><br>If, drunk with sight of power, we loose<br>Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,<br>Such boastings as the Gentiles use,<br>Or lesser breeds without the Law--<br>Lord God of hosts, be with us yet,<br>Lest we forget--lest we forget!<br><br>For heathen heart that puts her trust<br>In reeking tube and iron shard,<br>All valiant dust that builds on dust,<br>And guarding, calls not Thee to guard,<br>For frantic boast and foolish word--<br>Thy mercy on Thy People, Lord!<br><br>Much of Kipling's phraseology is taken from the Bible, and no doubt in<br>the second stanza he had in mind the text from Psalm CXXVII: 'Except the<br>lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord<br>keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.' It is not a text that<br>makes much impression on the post-Hitler mind. No one, in our time,<br>believes in any sanction greater than military power; no one believes<br>that it is possible to overcome force except by greater force. There is<br>no 'Law', there is only power. I am not saying that that is a true<br>belief, merely that it is the belief which all modern men do actually<br>hold. Those who pretend otherwise are either intellectual cowards, or<br>power-worshippers under a thin disguise, or have simply not caught up<br>with the age they are living in. Kipling's outlook is prefascist. He<br>still believes that pride comes before a fall and that the gods punish<br>HUBRIS. He does not foresee the tank, the bombing plane, the radio and<br>the secret police, or their psychological results.<br><br>But in saying this, does not one unsay what I said above about Kipling's<br>jingoism and brutality? No, one is merely saying that the<br>nineteenth-century imperialist outlook and the modern gangster outlook<br>are two different things. Kipling belongs very definitely to the period<br>1885-1902. The Great War and its aftermath embittered him, but he shows<br>little sign of having learned anything from any event later than the Boer<br>War. He was the prophet of British Imperialism in its expansionist phase<br>(even more than his poems, his solitary novel, THE LIGHT THAT FAILED,<br>gives you the atmosphere of that time) and also the unofficial historian<br>of the British Army, the old mercenary army which began to change its<br>shape in 1914. All his confidence, his bouncing vulgar vitality, sprang<br>out of limitations which no Fascist or near-Fascist shares.<br><br>Kipling spent the later part of his life in sulking, and no doubt it was<br>political disappointment rather than literary vanity that account for<br>this. Somehow history had not gone according to plan. After the greatest<br>victory she had ever known, Britain was a lesser world power than before,<br>and Kipling was quite acute enough to see this. The virtue had gone out<br>of the classes he idealized, the young were hedonistic or disaffected,<br>the desire to paint the map red had evaporated. He could not understand<br>what was happening, because he had never had any grasp of the economic<br>forces underlying imperial expansion. It is notable that Kipling does not<br>seem to realize, any more than the average soldier or colonial<br>administrator, that an empire is primarily a money-making concern.<br>Imperialism as he sees it is a sort of forcible evangelizing. You turn a<br>Gatling gun on a mob of unarmed 'natives', and then you establish 'the<br>Law', which includes roads, railways and a court-house. He could not<br>foresee, therefore, that the same motives which brought the Empire into<br>existence would end by destroying it. It was the same motive, for<br>example, that caused the Malayan jungles to be cleared for rubber<br>estates, and which now causes those estates to be handed over intact to<br>the Japanese. The modern totalitarians know what they are doing, and the<br>nineteenth-century English did not know what they were doing. Both<br>attitudes have their advantages, but Kipling was never able to move<br>forward from one into the other. His outlook, allowing for the fact that<br>after all he was an artist, was that of the salaried bureaucrat who<br>despises the 'box-wallah' and often lives a lifetime without realizing<br>that the 'box-wallah' calls the tune.<br><br>But because he identifies himself with the official class, he does<br>possess one thing which 'enlightened' people seldom or never possess, and<br>that is a sense of responsibility. The middle-class Left hate him for<br>this quite as much as for his cruelty and vulgarity. All left-wing<br>parties in the highly industrialized countries are at bottom a sham,<br>because they make it their business to fight against something which they<br>do not really wish to destroy. They have internationalist aims, and at<br>the same time they struggle to keep up a standard of life with which<br>those aims are incompatible. We all live by robbing Asiatic coolies, and<br>those of us who are 'enlightened' all maintain that those coolies ought<br>to be set free; but our standard of living, and hence our<br>'enlightenment', demands that the robbery shall continue. A humanitarian<br>is always a hypocrite, and Kipling's understanding of this is perhaps the<br>central secret of his power to create telling phrases. It would be<br>difficult to hit off the one-eyed pacifism of the English in fewer words<br>than in the phrase, 'making mock of uniforms that guard you while you<br>sleep'. It is true that Kipling does not understand the economic aspect<br>of the relationship between the highbrow and the blimp. He does not see<br>that the map is painted red chiefly in order that the coolie may be<br>exploited. Instead of the coolie he sees the Indian Civil Servant; but<br>even on that plane his grasp of function, of who protects whom, is very<br>sound. He sees clearly that men can only be highly civilized while other<br>men, inevitably less civilized, are there to guard and feed them.<br><br>How far does Kipling really identify himself with the administrators,<br>soldiers and engineers whose praises he sings? Not so completely as is<br>sometimes assumed. He had travelled very widely while he was still a<br>young man, he had grown up with a brilliant mind in mainly philistine<br>surroundings, and some streak in him that may have been partly neurotic<br>led him to prefer the active man to the sensitive man. The<br>nineteenth-century Anglo-Indians, to name the least sympathetic of his<br>idols, were at any rate people who did things. It may be that all that<br>they did was evil, but they changed the face of the earth (it is<br>instructive to look at a map of Asia and compare the railway system of<br>India with that of the surrounding countries), whereas they could have<br>achieved nothing, could not have maintained themselves in power for a<br>single week, if the normal Anglo-Indian outlook had been that of, say,<br>E.M. Forster. Tawdry and shallow though it is, Kipling's is the only<br>literary picture that we possess of nineteenth-century Anglo-India, and<br>he could only make it because he was just coarse enough to be able to<br>exist and keep his mouth shut in clubs and regimental messes. But he did<br>not greatly resemble the people he admired. I know from several private<br>sources that many of the Anglo-Indians who were Kipling's contemporaries<br>did not like or approve of him. They said, no doubt truly, that he knew<br>nothing about India, and on the other hand, he was from their point of<br>view too much of a highbrow. While in India he tended to mix with 'the<br>wrong' people, and because of his dark complexion he was wrongly<br>suspected of having a streak of Asiatic blood. Much in his development is<br>traceable to his having been born in India and having left school early.<br>With a slightly different background he might have been a good novelist<br>or a superlative writer of music-hall songs. But how true is it that he<br>was a vulgar flagwaver, a sort of publicity agent for Cecil Rhodes? It is<br>true, but it is not true that he was a yes-man or a time-server. After<br>his early days, if then, he never courted public opinion. Mr. Eliot says<br>that what is held against him is that he expressed unpopular views in a<br>popular style. This narrows the issue by assuming that 'unpopular' means<br>unpopular with the intelligentsia, but it is a fact that Kipling's<br>'message' was one that the big public did not want, and, indeed, has<br>never accepted. The mass of the people, in the nineties as now, were<br>anti-militarist, bored by the Empire, and only unconsciously patriotic.<br>Kipling's official admirers are and were the 'service' middle class, the<br>people who read BLACKWOOD'S. In the stupid early years of this century,<br>the blimps, having at last discovered someone who could be called a poet<br>and who was on their side, set Kipling on a pedestal, and some of his<br>more sententious poems, such as 'If', were given almost biblical status.<br>But it is doubtful whether the blimps have ever read him with attention,<br>any more than they have read the Bible. Much of what he says they could<br>not possibly approve. Few people who have criticized England from the<br>inside have said bitterer things about her than this gutter patriot. As a<br>rule it is the British working class that he is attacking, but not<br>always. That phrase about 'the flannelled fools at the wicket and the<br>muddied oafs at the goal' sticks like an arrow to this day, and it is<br>aimed at the Eton and Harrow match as well as the Cup-Tie Final. Some of<br>the verses he wrote about the Boer War have a curiously modern ring, so<br>far as their subject-matter goes. 'Stellenbosch', which must have been<br>written about 1902, sums up what every intelligent infantry officer was<br>saying in 1918, or is saying now, for that matter.<br><br>Kipling's romantic ideas about England and the Empire might not have<br>mattered if he could have held them without having the class-prejudices<br>which at that time went with them. If one examines his best and most<br>representative work, his soldier poems, especially BARRACK-ROOM BALLADS,<br>one notices that what more than anything else spoils them is an<br>underlying air of patronage. Kipling idealizes the army officer,<br>especially the junior officer, and that to an idiotic extent, but the<br>private soldier, though lovable and romantic, has to be a comic. He is<br>always made to speak in a sort of stylized Cockney, not very broad but<br>with all the aitches and final "g's" carefully omitted. Very often the<br>result is as embarrassing as the humorous recitation at a church social.<br>And this accounts for the curious fact that one can often improve<br>Kipling's poems, make them less facetious and less blatant, by simply<br>going through them and transplanting them from Cockney into standard<br>speech. This is especially true of his refrains, which often have a truly<br>lyrical quality. Two examples will do (one is about a funeral and the<br>other about a wedding):<br><br>So it's knock out your pipes and follow me!<br>And it's finish up your swipes and follow me!<br>Oh, hark to the big drum calling,<br>Follow me--follow me home!<br><br>and again:<br><br>Cheer for the Sergeant's wedding--<br>Give them one cheer more!<br>Grey gun-horses in the lando,<br>And a rogue is married to a whore!<br><br>Here I have restored the aitches, etc. Kipling ought to have known<br>better. He ought to have seen that the two closing lines of the first of<br>these stanzas are very beautiful lines, and that ought to have overriden<br>his impulse to make fun of a working-man's accent. In the ancient ballads<br>the lord and the peasant speak the same language. This is impossible to<br>Kipling, who is looking down a distorting class-perspective, and by a<br>piece of poetic justice one of his best lines is spoiled--for 'follow me<br>'ome' is much uglier than 'follow me home'. But even where it makes no<br>difference musically the facetiousness of his stage Cockney dialect is<br>irritating. However, he is more often quoted aloud than read on the<br>printed page, and most people instinctively make the necessary<br>alterations when they quote him.<br><br>Can one imagine any private soldier, in the nineties or now, reading<br>BARRACK-ROOM BALLADS and feeling that here was a writer who spoke for<br>him? It is very hard to do so. Any soldier capable of reading a book of<br>verse would notice at once that Kipling is almost unconscious of the<br>class war that goes on in an army as much as elsewhere. It is not only<br>that he thinks the soldier comic, but that he thinks him patriotic,<br>feudal, a ready admirer of his officers and proud to be a soldier of the<br>Queen. Of course that is partly true, or battles could not be fought, but<br>'What have I done for thee, England, my England?' is essentially a<br>middle-class query. Almost any working man would follow it up immediately<br>with 'What has England done for me?' In so far as Kipling grasps this, he<br>simply sets it down to 'the intense selfishness of the lower classes'<br>(his own phrase). When he is writing not of British but of 'loyal'<br>Indians he carries the 'Salaam, sahib' motif to sometimes disgusting<br>lengths. Yet it remains true that he has far more interest in the common<br>soldier, far more anxiety that he shall get a fair deal, than most of the<br>'liberals' of his day or our own. He sees that the soldier is neglected,<br>meanly underpaid and hypocritically despised by the people whose incomes<br>he safeguards. 'I came to realize', he says in his posthumous memoirs,<br>'the bare horrors of the private's life, and the unnecessary torments he<br>endured'. He is accused of glorifying war, and perhaps he does so, but<br>not in the usual manner, by pretending that war is a sort of football<br>match. Like most people capable of writing battle poetry, Kipling had<br>never been in battle, but his vision of war is realistic. He knows that<br>bullets hurt, that under fire everyone is terrified, that the ordinary<br>soldier never knows what the war is about or what is happening except in<br>his own corner of the battlefield, and that British troops, like other<br>troops, frequently run away:<br><br><br>I 'eard the knives be'ind me, but I dursn't face my man,<br>Nor I don't know where I went to, 'cause I didn't stop to see,<br>Till I 'eard a beggar squealin' out for quarter as 'e ran,<br>An' I thought I knew the voice an'--it was me!<br><br><br>Modernize the style of this, and it might have come out of one of the<br>debunking war books of the nineteen-twenties. Or again:<br><br><br>An' now the hugly bullets come peckin' through the dust,<br>An' no one wants to face 'em, but every beggar must;<br>So, like a man in irons, which isn't glad to go,<br>They moves 'em off by companies uncommon stiff an' slow.<br><br><br>Compare this with:<br><br><br>Forward the Light Brigade!<br>Was there a man dismayed?<br>No! though the soldier knew<br>Someone had blundered.<br><br><br>If anything, Kipling overdoes the horrors, for the wars of his youth were<br>hardly wars at all by our standards. Perhaps that is due to the neurotic<br>strain in him, the hunger for cruelty. But at least he knows that men<br>ordered to attack impossible objectives ARE dismayed, and also that<br>fourpence a day is not a generous pension.<br><br>How complete or truthful a picture has Kipling left us of the<br>long-service, mercenary army of the late nineteenth century? One must say<br>of this, as of what Kipling wrote about nineteenth-century Anglo-India,<br>that it is not only the best but almost the only literary picture we<br>have. He has put on record an immense amount of stuff that one could<br>otherwise only gather from verbal tradition or from unreadable regimental<br>histories. Perhaps his picture of army life seems fuller and more<br>accurate than it is because any middle-class English person is likely to<br>know enough to fill up the gaps. At any rate, reading the essay on<br>Kipling that Mr. Edmund Wilson has just published or is just about to<br>publish [Note, below], I was struck by the number of things that are<br>boringly familiar to us and seem to be barely intelligible to an American.<br>But from the body of Kipling's early work there does seem to emerge a vivid<br>and not seriously misleading picture of the old pre-machine-gun army--<br>the sweltering barracks in Gibraltar or Lucknow, the red coats, the<br>pipeclayed belts and the pillbox hats, the beer, the fights, the<br>floggings, hangings and crucifixions, the bugle-calls, the smell of oats<br>and horsepiss, the bellowing sergeants with foot-long moustaches, the<br>bloody skirmishes, invariably mismanaged, the crowded troopships, the<br>cholera-stricken camps, the 'native' concubines, the ultimate death in<br>the workhouse. It is a crude, vulgar picture, in which a patriotic<br>music-hall turn seems to have got mixed up with one of Zola's gorier<br>passages, but from it future generations will be able to gather some idea<br>of what a long-term volunteer army was like. On about the same level they<br>will be able to learn something of British India in the days when<br>motor-cars and refrigerators were unheard of. It is an error to imagine<br>that we might have had better books on these subjects if, for example,<br>George Moore, or Gissing, or Thomas Hardy, had had Kipling's<br>opportunities. That is the kind of accident that cannot happen. It was<br>not possible that nineteenth-century England should produce a book like<br>WAR AND PEACE, or like Tolstoy's minor stories of army life, such as<br>Sebastopol or THE COSSACKS, not because the talent was necessarily<br>lacking but because no one with sufficient sensitiveness to write such<br>books would ever have made the appropriate contacts. Tolstoy lived in a<br>great military empire in which it seemed natural for almost any young man<br>of family to spend a few years in the army, whereas the British Empire<br>was and still is demilitarized to a degree which continental observers<br>find almost incredible. Civilized men do not readily move away from the<br>centres of civilization, and in most languages there is a great dearth of<br>what one might call colonial literature. It took a very improbable<br>combination of circumstances to produce Kipling's gaudy tableau, in which<br>Private Ortheris and Mrs. Hauksbee pose against a background of palm<br>trees to the sound of temple bells, and one necessary circumstance was<br>that Kipling himself was only half civilized.<br><br><br>[Note: Published in a volume of Collected Essays, THE WOUND AND THE<br>BOW. Author's footnote 1945]<br><br><br>Kipling is the only English writer of our time who has added phrases to<br>the language. The phrases and neologisms which we take over and use<br>without remembering their origin do not always come from writers we<br>admire. It is strange, for instance, to hear the Nazi broadcasters<br>referring to the Russian soldiers as 'robots', thus unconsciously<br>borrowing a word from a Czech democrat whom they would have killed if<br>they could have laid hands on him. Here are half a dozen phrases coined<br>by Kipling which one sees quoted in leaderettes in the gutter press or<br>overhears in saloon bars from people who have barely heard his name. It<br>will be seen that they all have a certain characteristic in common:<br><br>East is East, and West is West.<br>The white man's burden.<br>What do they know of England who only England know?<br>The female of the species is more deadly than the male.<br>Somewhere East of Suez.<br>Paying the Dane-geld.<br><br>There are various others, including some that have outlived their context<br>by many years. The phrase 'killing Kruger with your mouth', for instance,<br>was current till very recently. It is also possible that it was Kipling<br>who first let loose the use of the word 'Huns' for Germans; at any rate<br>he began using it as soon as the guns opened fire in 1914. But what the<br>phrases I have listed above have in common is that they are all of them<br>phrases which one utters semi-derisively (as it might be 'For I'm to be<br>Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May'), but which one is<br>bound to make use of sooner or later. Nothing could exceed the contempt<br>of the NEW STATESMAN, for instance, for Kipling, but how many times<br>during the Munich period did the NEW STATESMAN find itself quoting that<br>phrase about paying the Dane-geld[Note, below]? The fact is that Kipling,<br>apart from his snack-bar wisdom and his gift for packing much cheap<br>picturesqueness into a few words ('palm and pine'--'east of Suez'--'the<br>road to Mandalay'), is generally talking about things that are of urgent<br>interest. It does not matter, from this point of view, that thinking and<br>decent people generally find themselves on the other side of the fence<br>from him. 'White man's burden' instantly conjures up a real problem, even<br>if one feels that it ought to be altered to 'black man's burden'. One may<br>disagree to the middle of one's bones with the political attitude implied<br>in 'The Islanders', but one cannot say that it is a frivolous attitude.<br>Kipling deals in thoughts which are both vulgar and permanent. This<br>raises the question of his special status as a poet, or verse-writer.<br><br><br>[Note: On the first page of his recent book, ADAM AND EVE, Mr. Middleton<br>Murry quotes the well-known lines:<br><br>There are nine and sixty ways<br>Of constructing tribal lays,<br>And every single one of them is right.<br><br>He attributes these lines to Thackeray. This is probably what is known as<br>a 'Freudian error.' A civilized person would prefer not to quote Kipling<br>--i.e. would prefer not to feel that it was Kipling who had expressed his<br>thought for him. (Author's footnote 1945.)]<br><br><br>Mr. Eliot describes Kipling's metrical work as 'verse' and not 'poetry',<br>but adds that it is 'GREAT verse', and further qualifies this by saying<br>that a writer can only be described as a 'great verse-writer' if there is<br>some of his work 'of which we cannot say whether it is verse or poetry'.<br>Apparently Kipling was a versifier who occasionally wrote poems, in which<br>case it was a pity that Mr. Eliot did not specify these poems by name.<br>The trouble is that whenever an aesthetic judgement on Kipling's work<br>seems to be called for, Mr. Eliot is too much on the defensive to be able<br>to speak plainly. What he does not say, and what I think one ought to<br>start by saying in any discussion of Kipling, is that most of Kipling's<br>verse is so horribly vulgar that it gives one the same sensation as one<br>gets from watching a third-rate music-hall performer recite 'The Pigtail<br>of Wu Fang Fu' with the purple limelight on his face, AND yet there is<br>much of it that is capable of giving pleasure to people who know what<br>poetry means. At his worst, and also his most vital, in poems like 'Gunga<br>Din' or 'Danny Deever', Kipling is almost a shameful pleasure, like the<br>taste for cheap sweets that some people secretly carry into middle life.<br>But even with his best passages one has the same sense of being seduced<br>by something spurious, and yet unquestionably seduced. Unless one is<br>merely a snob and a liar it is impossible to say that no one who cares<br>for poetry could get any pleasure out of such lines as:<br><br><br>For the wind is in the palm trees, and the temple bells they say,<br>'Come you back, you British soldier, come you back to Mandalay!'<br><br><br>and yet those lines are not poetry in the same sense as 'Felix Randal' or<br>'When icicles hang by the wall' are poetry. One can, perhaps, place<br>Kipling more satisfactorily than by juggling with the words 'verse' and<br>'poetry', if one describes him simply as a good bad poet. He is as a poet<br>what Harriet Beecher Stowe was as a novelist. And the mere existence of<br>work of this kind, which is perceived by generation after generation to<br>be vulgar and yet goes on being read, tells one something about the age<br>we live in.<br><br><br>There is a great deal of good bad poetry in English, all of it, I should<br>say, subsequent to 1790. Examples of good bad poems--I am deliberately<br>choosing diverse ones--are 'The Bridge of Sighs', 'When all the world is<br>young, lad', 'The Charge of the Light Brigade', Bret Harte's 'Dickens in<br>Camp', 'The Burial of Sir John Moore', 'Jenny Kissed Me', 'Keith of<br>Ravelston', 'Casabianca'. All of these reek of sentimentality, and yet--<br>not these particular poems, perhaps, but poems of this kind, are capable<br>of giving true pleasure to people who can see clearly what is wrong with<br>them. One could fill a fair-sized anthology with good bad poems, if it<br>were not for the significant fact that good bad poetry is usually too<br>well known to be worth reprinting.<br><br>It is no use pretending that in an age like our own, 'good' poetry can<br>have any genuine popularity. It is, and must be, the cult of a very few<br>people, the least tolerated of the arts. Perhaps that statement needs a<br>certain amount of qualification. True poetry can sometimes be acceptable<br>to the mass of the people when it disguises itself as something else. One<br>can see an example of this in the folk-poetry that England still<br>possesses, certain nursery rhymes and mnemonic rhymes, for instance, and<br>the songs that soldiers make up, including the words that go to some of<br>the bugle-calls. But in general ours is a civilization in which the very<br>word 'poetry' evokes a hostile snigger or, at best, the sort of frozen<br>disgust that most people feel when they hear the word 'God'. If you are<br>good at playing the concertina you could probably go into the nearest<br>public bar and get yourself an appreciative audience within five minutes.<br>But what would be the attitude of that same audience if you suggested<br>reading them Shakespeare's sonnets, for instance? Good bad poetry,<br>however, can get across to the most unpromising audiences if the right<br>atmosphere has been worked up beforehand. Some months back Churchill<br>produced a great effect by quoting Clough's 'Endeavour' in one of his<br>broadcast speeches. I listened to this speech among people who could<br>certainly not be accused of caring for poetry, and I am convinced that<br>the lapse into verse impressed them and did not embarrass them. But not<br>even Churchill could have got away with it if he had quoted anything much<br>better than this.<br><br>In so far as a writer of verse can be popular, Kipling has been and<br>probably still is popular. In his own lifetime some of his poems<br>travelled far beyond the bounds of the reading public, beyond the world<br>of school prize-days, Boy Scout singsongs, limp-leather editions,<br>pokerwork and calendars, and out into the yet vaster world of the music<br>halls. Nevertheless, Mr. Eliot thinks it worth while to edit him, thus<br>confessing to a taste which others share but are not always honest enough<br>to mention. The fact that such a thing as good bad poetry can exist is a<br>sign of the emotional overlap between the intellectual and the ordinary<br>man. The intellectual is different from the ordinary man, but only in<br>certain sections of his personality, and even then not all the time. But<br>what is the peculiarity of a good bad poem? A good bad poem is a graceful<br>monument to the obvious. It records in memorable form--for verse is a<br>mnemonic device, among other things--some emotion which very nearly<br>every human being can share. The merit of a poem like 'When all the world<br>is young, lad' is that, however sentimental it may be, its sentiment is<br>'true' sentiment in the sense that you are bound to find yourself<br>thinking the thought it expresses sooner or later; and then, if you<br>happen to know the poem, it will come back into your mind and seem better<br>than it did before. Such poems are a kind of rhyming proverb, and it is a<br>fact that definitely popular poetry is usually gnomic or sententious. One<br>example from Kipling will do:<br><br>White hands cling to the bridle rein,<br>Slipping the spur from the booted heel;<br>Tenderest voices cry 'Turn again!'<br>Red lips tarnish the scabbarded steel:<br>Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne,<br>He travels the fastest who travels alone.<br><br>There is a vulgar thought vigorously expressed. It may not be true, but<br>at any rate it is a thought that everyone thinks. Sooner or later you<br>will have occasion to feel that he travels the fastest who travels alone,<br>and there the thought is, ready made and, as it were, waiting for you. So<br>the chances are that, having once heard this line, you will remember it.<br><br>One reason for Kipling's power as a good bad poet I have already<br>suggested--his sense of responsibility, which made it possible for him<br>to have a world-view, even though it happened to be a false one. Although<br>he had no direct connexion with any political party, Kipling was a<br>Conservative, a thing that does not exist nowadays. Those who now call<br>themselves Conservatives are either Liberals, Fascists or the accomplices<br>of Fascists. He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the<br>opposition. In a gifted writer this seems to us strange and even<br>disgusting, but it did have the advantage of giving Kipling a certain<br>grip on reality. The ruling power is always faced with the question, 'In<br>such and such circumstances, what would you DO?', whereas the opposition<br>is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions. Where<br>it is a permanent and pensioned opposition, as in England, the quality of<br>its thought deteriorates accordingly. Moreover, anyone who starts out<br>with a pessimistic, reactionary view of life tends to be justified by<br>events, for Utopia never arrives and 'the gods of the copybook headings',<br>as Kipling himself put it, always return. Kipling sold out to the British<br>governing class, not financially but emotionally. This warped his<br>political judgement, for the British ruling class were not what he<br>imagined, and it led him into abysses of folly and snobbery, but he<br>gained a corresponding advantage from having at least tried to imagine<br>what action and responsibility are like. It is a great thing in his<br>favour that he is not witty, not 'daring', has no wish to ÉPATER LES<br>BOURGEOIS. He dealt largely in platitudes, and since we live in a world<br>of platitudes, much of what he said sticks. Even his worst follies seem<br>less shallow and less irritating than the 'enlightened' utterances of the<br>same period, such as Wilde's epigrams or the collection of<br>cracker-mottoes at the end of MAN AND SUPERMAN.<br><br></font></p>
