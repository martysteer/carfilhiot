<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Some years ago a friend took me to the little Berkshire church of which<br>the celebrated Vicar of Bray was once the incumbent. (Actually it is a<br>few miles from Bray, but perhaps at that time the two livings were one.)<br>In the churchyard there stands a magnificent yew tree which, according to<br>a notice at its foot, was planted by no less a person than the Vicar of<br>Bray himself. And it struck me at the time as curious that such a man<br>should have left such a relic behind him.<br><br>The Vicar of Bray, though he was well equipped to be a leader-writer on<br>THE TIMES, could hardly be described as an admirable character. Yet,<br>after this lapse of time, all that is left of him is a comic song and a<br>beautiful tree, which has rested the eyes of generation after generation<br>and must surely have outweighed any bad effects which he produced by his<br>political quislingism.<br><br>Thibaw, the last King of Burma, was also far from being a good man. He<br>was a drunkard, he had five hundred wives--he seems to have kept them<br>chiefly for show, however--and when he came to the throne his first act<br>was to decapitate seventy or eighty of his brothers. Yet he did posterity<br>a good turn by planting the dusty streets of Mandalay with tamarind trees<br>which cast a pleasant shade until the Japanese incendiary bombs burned<br>them down in 1942.<br><br>The poet, James Shirley, seems to have generalised too freely when he<br>said that "Only the actions of the just Smell sweet and blossom in their<br>dust". Sometimes the actions of the unjust make quite a good showing<br>after the appropriate lapse of time. When I saw the Vicar of Bray's yew<br>tree it reminded me of something, and afterwards I got hold of a book of<br>selections from the writings of John Aubrey and reread a pastoral poem<br>which must have been written some time in the first half of the<br>seventeenth century, and which was inspired by a certain Mrs Overall.<br><br>Mrs Overall was the wife of a Dean and was extensively unfaithful to him.<br>According to Aubrey she "could scarcely denie any one", and she had "the<br>loveliest Eies that were ever seen, but wondrous wanton". The poem (the<br>"shepherd swaine" seems to have been somebody called Sir John Selby)<br>starts off:<br><br>Downe lay the Shepherd Swaine<br>So sober and demure<br>Wishing for his wench againe<br>So bonny and so pure<br>With his head on hillock lowe<br>And his arms akimboe<br>And all was for the losse of his<br>Hye nonny nonny noe. . . .<br>Sweet she was, as kind a love<br>As ever fetter'd Swaine;<br>Never such a daynty one<br>Shall man enjoy again.<br>Sett a thousand on a rowe<br>I forbid that any showe<br>Ever the like of her<br>Hye nonny nonny noe.<br><br>As the poem proceeds through another six verses, the refrain "Hye nonny<br>nonny noe" takes on an unmistakably obscene meaning, but it ends with the<br>exquisite stanza:<br><br>But gone she is the prettiest lasse<br>That ever trod on plaine.<br>What ever hath betide of her<br>Blame not the Shepherd Swaine.<br>For why? She was her owne Foe,<br>And gave herself the overthrowe<br>By being so franke of her<br>Hye nonny nonny noe.<br><br>Mrs Overall was no more an exemplary character than the Vicar of Bray,<br>though a more attractive one. Yet in the end all that remains of her is a<br>poem which still gives pleasure to many people, though for some reason it<br>never gets into the anthologies. The suffering which she presumably<br>caused, and the misery and futility in which her own life must have<br>ended, have been transformed into a sort of lingering fragrance like the<br>smell of tobacco-plants on a summer evening.<br><br>But to come back to trees. The planting of a tree, especially one of the<br>long-living hardwood trees, is a gift which you can make to posterity at<br>almost no cost and with almost no trouble, and if the tree takes root it<br>will far outlive the visible effect of any of your other actions, good or<br>evil. A year or two ago I wrote a few paragraphs in TRIBUNE about some<br>sixpenny rambler roses from Woolworth's which I had planted before the<br>war. This brought me an indignant letter from a reader who said that<br>roses are bourgeois, but I still think that my sixpence was better spent<br>than if it had gone on cigarettes or even on one of the excellent Fabian<br>Research Pamphlets.<br><br>Recently, I spent a day at the cottage where I used to live, and noted<br>with a pleased surprise--to be exact, it was a feeling of having done good<br>unconsciously--the progress of the things I had planted nearly ten years<br>ago. I think it is worth recording what some of them cost, just to show<br>what you can do with a few shillings if you invest them in something that<br>grows.<br><br>First of all there were the two ramblers from Woolworth's, and three<br>polyantha roses, all at sixpence each. Then there were two bush roses<br>which were part of a job lot from a nursery garden. This job lot<br>consisted of six fruit trees, three rose bushes and two gooseberry<br>bushes, all for ten shillings. One of the fruit trees and one of the rose<br>bushes died, but the rest are all flourishing. The sum total is five<br>fruit trees, seven roses and two gooseberry bushes, all for twelve and<br>sixpence. These plants have not entailed much work, and have had nothing<br>spent on them beyond the original amount. They never even received any<br>manure, except what I occasionally collected in a bucket when one of the<br>farm horses happened to have halted outside the gate.<br><br>Between them, in nine years, those seven rose bushes will have given what<br>would add up to a hundred or a hundred and fifty months of bloom. The<br>fruit trees, which were mere saplings when I put them in, are now just<br>about getting in their stride. Last week one them, a plum, was a mass of<br>blossom, and the apples looked as if they were going to do fairly well.<br>What had originally been the weakling of the family, a Cox's Orange<br>Pippin--it would hardly have been included in the job lot if it had been a<br>good plant--had grown into a sturdy tree with plenty of fruit spurs on it.<br>I maintain that it was a public-spirited action to plant that Cox, for<br>these trees do not fruit quickly and I did not expect to stay there long.<br>I never had an apple off it myself, but it looks as if someone else will<br>have quite a lot. By their fruits ye shall know them, and the Cox's<br>Orange Pippin is a good fruit to be known by. Yet I did not plant it with<br>the conscious intention of doing anybody a good turn. I just saw the job<br>lot going cheap and stuck the things into the ground without much<br>preparation.<br><br>A thing which I regret, and which I will try to remedy some time, is that<br>I have never in my life planted a walnut. Nobody does plant them<br>nowadays--when you see a walnut it is almost invariably an old tree. If<br>you plant a walnut you are planting it for your grandchildren, and who<br>cares a damn for his grandchildren? Nor does anybody plant a quince, a<br>mulberry or a medlar. But these are garden trees which you can only be<br>expected to plant if you have a patch of ground of your own. On the other<br>hand, in any hedge or in any piece of waste ground you happen to be<br>walking through, you can do something to remedy the appalling massacre of<br>trees, especially oaks, ashes, elms and beeches, which has happened<br>during the war years.<br><br>Even an apple tree is liable to live for about 100 years, so that the Cox<br>I planted in 1936 may still be bearing fruit well into the twenty-first<br>century. An oak or a beech may live for hundreds of years and be a<br>pleasure to thousands or tens of thousands of people before it is finally<br>sawn up into timber. I am not suggesting that one can discharge all one's<br>obligations towards society by means of a private re-afforestation<br>scheme. Still, it might not be a bad idea, every time you commit an<br>antisocial act, to make a note of it in your diary, and then, at the<br>appropriate season, push an acorn into the ground.<br><br>And, if even one in twenty of them came to maturity, you might do quite a<br>lot of harm in your lifetime, and still, like the Vicar of Bray, end up<br>as a public benefactor after all. <br><br></font></p>
