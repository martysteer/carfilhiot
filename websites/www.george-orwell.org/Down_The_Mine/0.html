<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Our civilization, pace Chesterton, is founded on coal, more completely<br>than one realizes until one stops to think about it. The machines that<br>keep us alive, and the machines that make machines, are all directly or<br>indirectly dependent upon coal. In the metabolism of the Western world<br>the coal-miner is second in importance only to the man who ploughs the<br>soil. He is a sort of caryatid upon whose shoulders nearly everything<br>that is not grimy is supported. For this reason the actual process by<br>which coal is extracted is well worth watching, if you get the chance and<br>are willing to take the trouble.<br><br>When you go down a coal-mine it is important to try and get to the coal<br>face when the 'fillers' are at work. This is not easy, because when the<br>mine is working visitors are a nuisance and are not encouraged, but if<br>you go at any other time, it is possible to come away with a totally<br>wrong impression. On a Sunday, for instance, a mine seems almost<br>peaceful. The time to go there is when the machines are roaring and the<br>air is black with coal dust, and when you can actually see what the<br>miners have to do. At those times the place is like hell, or at any rate<br>like my own mental picture of hell. Most of the things one imagines in<br>hell are if there--heat, noise, confusion, darkness, foul air, and,<br>above all, unbearably cramped space. Everything except the fire, for<br>there is no fire down there except the feeble beams of Davy lamps and<br>electric torches which scarcely penetrate the clouds of coal dust.<br><br>When you have finally got there--and getting there is a in itself: I<br>will explain that in a moment--you crawl through the last line of pit<br>props and see opposite you a shiny black wall three or four feet high.<br>This is the coal face. Overhead is the smooth ceiling made by the rock<br>from which the coal has been cut; underneath is the rock again, so that<br>the gallery you are in is only as high as the ledge of coal itself,<br>probably not much more than a yard. The first impression of all,<br>overmastering everything else for a while, is the frightful, deafening<br>din from the conveyor belt which carries the coal away. You cannot see<br>very far, because the fog of coal dust throws back the beam of your lamp,<br>but you can see on either side of you the line of half-naked kneeling<br>men, one to every four or five yards, driving their shovels under the<br>fallen coal and flinging it swiftly over their left shoulders. They are<br>feeding it on to the conveyor belt, a moving rubber, belt a couple of<br>feet wide which runs a yard or two behind them. Down this belt a<br>glittering river of coal races constantly. In a big mine it is carrying<br>away several tons of coal every minute. It bears it off to some place in<br>the main roads where it is shot into tubs holding half a tun, and thence<br>dragged to the cages and hoisted to the outer air.<br><br>It is impossible to watch the 'fillers' at work without feelling a pang<br>of envy for their toughness. It is a dreadful job that they do, an almost<br>superhuman job by the standard of an ordinary person. For they are not<br>only shifting monstrous quantities of coal, they are also doing, it in a<br>position that doubles or trebles the work. They have got to remain<br>kneeling all the while--they could hardly rise from their knees without<br>hitting the ceiling--and you can easily see by trying it what a<br>tremendous effort this means. Shovelling is comparatively easy when you<br>are standing up, because you can use your knee and thigh to drive the<br>shovel along; kneeling down, the whole of the strain is thrown upon your<br>arm and belly muscles. And the other conditions do not exactly make<br>things easier. There is the heat--it varies, but in some mines it is<br>suffocating--and the coal dust that stuffs up your throat and nostrils<br>and collects along your eyelids, and the unending rattle of the conveyor<br>belt, which in that confined space is rather like the rattle of a machine<br>gun. But the fillers look and work as though they were made of iron. They<br>really do look like iron hammered iron statues--under the smooth coat of<br>coal dust which clings to them from head to foot. It is only when you see<br>miners down the mine and naked that you realize what splendid men, they<br>are. Most of them are small (big men are at a disadvantage in that job)<br>but nearly all of them have the most noble bodies; wide shoulders<br>tapering to slender supple waists, and small pronounced buttocks and<br>sinewy thighs, with not an ounce of waste flesh anywhere. In the hotter<br>mines they wear only a pair of thin drawers, clogs and knee-pads; in the<br>hottest mines of all, only the clogs and knee-pads. You can hardly tell<br>by the look of them whether they are young or old. They may be any age up<br>to sixty or even sixty-five, but when they are black and naked they all<br>look alike. No one could do their work who had not a young man's body,<br>and a figure fit for a guardsman at that, just a few pounds of extra<br>flesh on the waist-line, and the constant bending would be impossible.<br>You can never forget that spectacle once you have seen it--the line of<br>bowed, kneeling figures, sooty black all over, driving their, huge<br>shovels under the coal with stupendous force and speed. They are on the<br>job for seven and a half hours, theoretically without a break, for there<br>is no time 'off'. Actually they, snatch a quarter of an hour or so at<br>some time during the shift to eat the food they have brought with them,<br>usually a hunk of bread and dripping and a bottle of cold tea. The first<br>time I was watching the 'fillers' at work I put my hand upon some<br>dreadful slimy thing among the coal dust. It was a chewed quid of<br>tobacco. Nearly all the miners chew tobacco, which is said to be good<br>against thirst.<br><br>Probably you have to go down several coal-mines before you can get much<br>grasp of the processes that are going on round you. This is chiefly<br>because the mere effort of getting from place to place; makes it<br>difficult to notice anything else, In some ways it is even disappointing,<br>or at least is unlike what you have, expected. You get into the cage,<br>which is a steel box about as wide as a telephone box and two or three<br>times as long. It holds ten men, but they pack it like pilchards in a<br>tin, and a tall man cannot stand upright in it. The steel door shuts upon<br>you, and somebody working the winding gear above drops you into the void.<br>You have the usual momentary qualm in your belly and a bursting sensation<br>in the cars, but not much sensation of movement till you get near the<br>bottom, when the cage slows down so abruptly that you could swear it is<br>going upwards again. In the middle of the run the cage probably touches<br>sixty miles an hour; in some of the deeper mines it touches even more.<br>When you crawl out at the bottom you are perhaps four hundred yards<br>underground. That is to say you have a tolerable-sized mountain on top of<br>you; hundreds of yards of solid rock, bones of extinct beasts, subsoil,<br>flints, roots of growing things, green grass and cows grazing on it--all<br>this suspended over your head and held back only by wooden props as thick<br>as the calf of your leg. But because of the speed at which the cage has<br>brought you down, and the complete blackness through which you have<br>travelled, you hardly feel yourself deeper down than you would at the<br>bottom of the Piccadilly tube.<br><br>What is surprising, on the other hand, is the immense horizontal<br>distances that have to be travelled underground. Before I had been down a<br>mine I had vaguely imagined the miner stepping out of the cage and<br>getting to work on a ledge of coal a few yards away. I had not realized<br>that before he even gets to work he may have had to creep along passages<br>as long as from London Bridge to Oxford Circus. In the beginning, of<br>course, a mine shaft is sunk somewhere near a seam of coal; But as that<br>seam is worked out and fresh seams are followed up, the workings get<br>further and further from the pit bottom. If it is a mile from the pit<br>bottom to the coal face, that is probably an average distance; three<br>miles is a fairly normal one; there are even said to be a few mines where<br>it is as much as five miles. But these distances bear no relation to<br>distances above ground. For in all that mile or three miles as it may be,<br>there is hardly anywhere outside the main road, and not many places even<br>there, where a man can stand upright.<br><br>You do not notice the effect of this till you have gone a few hundred<br>yards. You start off, stooping slightly, down the dim-lit gallery, eight<br>or ten feet wide and about five high, with the walls built up with slabs<br>of shale, like the stone walls in Derbyshire. Every yard or two there are<br>wooden props holding up the beams and girders; some of the girders have<br>buckled into fantastic curves under which you have to duck. Usually it is<br>bad going underfoot--thick dust or jagged chunks of shale, and in some<br>mines where there is water it is as mucky as a farm-yard. Also there is<br>the track for the coal tubs, like a miniature railway track with sleepers<br>a foot or two apart, which is tiresome to walk on. Everything is grey<br>with shale dust; there is a dusty fiery smell which seems to be the same<br>in all mines. You see mysterious machines of which you never learn the<br>purpose, and bundles of tools slung together on wires, and sometimes mice<br>darting away from the beam of the lamps. They are surprisingly common,<br>especially in mines where there are or have been horses. It would be<br>interesting to know how they got there in the first place; possibly by<br>falling down the shaft--for they say a mouse can fall any distance<br>uninjured, owing to its surface area being so large relative to its<br>weight. You press yourself against the wall to make way for lines of tubs<br>jolting slowly towards the shaft, drawn by an endless steel cable<br>operated from the surface. You creep through sacking curtains and thick<br>wooden doors which, when they are opened, let out fierce blasts of air.<br>These doors are an important part of the ventilation system. The<br>exhausted air is sucked out of one shaft by means of fans, and the fresh<br>air enters the other of its own accord. But if left to itself the air<br>will take the shortest way round, leaving the deeper workings<br>unventilated; so all the short cuts have to be partitioned off.<br><br>At the start to walk stooping is rather a joke, but it is a joke that<br>soon wears off. I am handicapped by being exceptionally tall, but when<br>the roof falls to four feet or less it is a tough job for anybody except<br>a dwarf or a child. You not only have to bend double, you have also got<br>to keep your head up all the while so as to see the beams and girders and<br>dodge them when they come. You have, thehefore, a constant crick in the<br>neck, but this is nothing to the pain in your knees and thighs. After<br>half a mile it becomes (I am not exaggerating) an unbearable agony. You<br>begin to wonder whether you will ever get to the end--still more, how on<br>earth you are going to get back. Your pace grows slower and slower. You<br>come to a stretch of a couple of hundred yards where it is all<br>exceptionally low and you have to work yourself along in a squatting<br>position. Then suddenly the roof opens out to a mysterious height--scene<br>of and old fall of rock, probably--and for twenty whole yards you can<br>stand upright. The relief is overwhelming. But after this there is<br>another low stretch of a hundred yards and then a succession of beams<br>which you have to crawl under. You go down on all fours; even this is a<br>relief after the squatting business. But when you come to the end of the<br>beams and try to get up again, you find that your knees have temporarily<br>struck work and refuse to lift you. You call a halt, ignominiously, and<br>say that you would like to rest for a minute or two. Your guide (a miner)<br>is sympathetic. He knows that your muscles are not the same as his. 'Only<br>another four hundred yards,' he says encouragingly; you feel that he<br>might as well say another four hundred miles. But finally you do somehow<br>creep as far as the coal face. You have gone a mile and taken the best<br>part of an hour; a miner would do it in not much more than twenty<br>minutes. Having got there, you have to sprawl in the coal dust and get<br>your strength back for several minutes before you can even watch the work<br>in progress with any kind of intelligence.<br><br>Coming back is worse than going, not only because you are already tired<br>out but because the journey back to the shaft is slightly uphill. You get<br>through the low places at the speed of a tortoise, and you have no shame<br>now about calling a halt when your knees give way. Even the lamp you are<br>carrying becomes a nuisance and probably when you stumble you drop it;<br>whereupon, if it is a Davy lamp, it goes out. Ducking the beams becomes<br>more and more of an effort, and sometimes you forget to duck. You try<br>walking head down as the miners do, and then you bang your backbone. Even<br>the miners bang their backbones fairly often. This is the reason why in<br>very hot mines, where it is necessary to go about half naked, most of the<br>miners have what they call 'buttons down the back'--that is, a permanent<br>scab on each vertebra. When the track is down hill the miners sometimes<br>fit their clogs, which are hollow under-neath, on to the trolley rails<br>and slide down. In mines where the 'travelling' is very bad all the<br>miners carry sticks about two and a half feet long, hollowed out below<br>the handle. In normal places you keep your hand on top of the stick and<br>in the low places you slide your hand down into the hollow. These sticks<br>are a great help, and the wooden crash-helmets--a comparatively recent<br>invention--are a godsend. They look like a French or Italian steel<br>helmet, but they are made of some kind of pith and very light, and so<br>strong, that you can take a violent blow on the head without feeling it.<br>When finally you get back to the surface you have been perhaps three<br>hours underground and travelled two miles, and you, are more exhausted<br>than you would be by a twenty-five-mile walk above ground. For a week<br>afterwards your thighs are so stiff that coming downstairs is quite a<br>difficult feat; you have to work your way down in a peculiar sidelong<br>manner, without bending the knees. Your miner friends notice the<br>stiffness of your walk and chaff you about it. ('How'd ta like to work<br>down pit, eh?' etc.) Yet even a miner who has been long away front work--<br>from illness, for instance--when he comes back to the pit, suffers badly<br>for the first few days.<br><br>It may seem that I am exaggerating, though no one who has been down an<br>old-fashioned pit (most of the pits in England are old-fashioned) and<br>actually gone as far as the coal face, is likely to say so. But what I<br>want to emphasize is this. Here is this frightful business of crawling to<br>and fro, which to any normal person is a hard day's work in itself; and<br>it is not part of the miner's work at all, it is merely an extra, like<br>the City man's daily ride in the Tube. The miner does that journey to and<br>fro, and sandwiched in between there are seven and a half hours of savage<br>work. I have never travelled much more than a mile to the coal face; but<br>often it is three miles, in which case I and most people other than<br>coal-miners would never get there at all. This is the kind of point that<br>one is always liable to miss. When you think of the coal-mine you think<br>of depth, heat, darkness, blackened figures hacking at walls of coal; you<br>don't think, necessarily, of those miles of creeping to and fro. There is<br>the question of time, also. A miner's working shift of seven and a half<br>hours does not sound very long, but one has got to add on to it at least<br>an hour a day for 'travelling', more often two hours and sometimes three.<br>Of course, the 'travelling' is not technically work and the miner is not<br>paid for it; but it is as like work as makes no difference. It is easy to<br>say that miners don't mind all this. Certainly, it is not the same for<br>them as it would be for you or me. They have done it since childhood,<br>they have the right muscles hardened, and they can move to and fro<br>underground with a startling and rather horrible agility. A miner puts<br>his head down and runs, with a long swinging stride, through places where<br>I can only stagger. At the workings you see them on all fours, skipping<br>round the pit props almost like dogs. But it is quite a mistake to think<br>that they enjoy it. I have talked about this to scores of miners and they<br>all admit that the 'travelling' is hard work; in any case when you hear<br>them discussing a pit among themselves the 'travelling' is always one of<br>the things they discuss. It is said that a shift always returns from work<br>faster than it goes; nevertheless the miners all say that it is the<br>coming away after a hard day's work, that is especially irksome. It is<br>part of their work and they are equal to it, but certainly it is an<br>effort. It is comparable, perhaps, to climbing a smallish mountain before<br>and after your day's work.<br><br>When you have been down in two or three pits you begin to get some grasp<br>of the processes that are going on underground. (I ought to say, by the<br>way, that I know nothing whatever about the technical side of mining: I<br>am merely describing what I have seen.) Coal lies in thin seams between<br>enormous layers of rock, so that essentially the process of getting it<br>out is like scooping the central layer from a Neapolitan ice. In the old<br>days the miners used to cut straight into the coal with pick and crowbar<br>--a very slow job because coal, when lying in its virgin state, is almost<br>as hard as rock. Nowadays the preliminary work is done by an<br>electrically-driven coal-cutter, which in principle is an immensely tough<br>and powerful band-saw, running horizontally instead of vertically, with<br>teeth a couple of inches long and half an inch or an inch thick. It can<br>move backwards or forwards on its own power, and the men operating it can<br>rotate it this way or that. Incidentally it makes one of the most awful<br>noises I have ever heard, and sends forth clouds of coal dust which make<br>it impossible to see more than two to three feet and almost impossible to<br>breathe. The machine travels along the coal face cutting into the base of<br>the coal and undermining it to the depth of five feet or five feet and a<br>half; after this it is comparatively easy to extract the coal to the<br>depth to which it has been undermined. Where it is 'difficult getting',<br>however, it has also to be loosened with explosives. A man with an<br>electric drill, like a rather small version of the drills used in<br>street-mending, bores holes at intervals in the coal, inserts blasting<br>powder, plugs it with clay, goes round the corner if there is one handy<br>(he is supposed to retire to twenty-five yards distance) and touches off<br>the charge with an electric current. This is not intended to bring the<br>coal out, only to loosen it. Occasionally, of course, the charge is too<br>powerful, and then it not only brings the coal out but brings the roof<br>down as well.<br><br>After the blasting has been done the 'fillers' can tumble the coal out,<br>break it up and shovel it on to the conveyor belt. It comes out first in<br>monstrous boulders which may weigh anything up to twenty tons. The<br>conveyor belt shoots it on to tubs, and the tubs are shoved into the main<br>road and hitched on to an endlessly revolving steel cable which drags<br>them to the cage. Then they are hoisted, and at the surface the coal is<br>sorted by being run over screens, and if necessary is washed as well. As<br>far as possible the 'dirt'--the shale, that is--is used for making the<br>roads below. All what cannot be used is sent to the surface and dumped;<br>hence the monstrous 'dirt-heaps', like hideous grey mountains, which are<br>the characteristic scenery of the coal areas. When the coal has been<br>extracted to the depth to which the machine has cut, the coal face has<br>advanced by five feet. Fresh props are put in to hold up the newly<br>exposed roof, and during the next shift the conveyor belt is taken to<br>pieces, moved five feet forward and re-assembled. As far as possible the<br>three operations of cutting, blasting and extraction are done in three<br>separate shifts, the cutting in the afternoon, the blasting at night<br>(there is a law, not always kept, that forbids its being done when other<br>men are working near by), and the 'filling' in the morning shift, which<br>lasts from six in the morning until half past one.<br><br>Even when you watch the process of coal-extraction you probably only<br>watch it for a short time, and it is not until you begin making a few<br>calculations that you realize what a stupendous task the 'fillers' are<br>performing. Normally each o man has to clear a space four or five yards<br>wide. The cutter has undermined the coal to the depth of five feet, so<br>that if the seam of coal is three or four feet high, each man has to cut<br>out, break up and load on to the belt something between seven and twelve<br>cubic yards of coal. This is to say, taking a cubic yard as weighing<br>twenty-seven hundred-weight, that each man is shifting coal at a speed<br>approaching two tons an hour. I have just enough experience of pick and<br>shovel work to be able to grasp what this means. When I am digging<br>trenches in my garden, if I shift two tons of earth during the afternoon,<br>I feel that I have earned my tea. But earth is tractable stuff compared<br>with coal, and I don't have to work kneeling down, a thousand feet<br>underground, in suffocating heat and swallowing coal dust with every<br>breath I take; nor do I have to walk a mile bent double before I begin.<br>The miner's job would be as much beyond my power as it would be to<br>perform on a flying trapeze or to win the Grand National. I am not a<br>manual labourer and please God I never shall be one, but there are some<br>kinds of manual work that I could do if I had to. At a pitch I could be a<br>tolerable road-sweeper or an inefficient gardener or even a tenth-rate<br>farm hand. But by no conceivable amount of effort or training could I<br>become a coal-miner, the work would kill me in a few weeks.<br><br>Watching coal-miners at work, you realize momentarily what different<br>universes people inhabit. Down there where coal is dug is a sort of world<br>apart which one can quite easily go through life without ever hearing<br>about. Probably majority of people would even prefer not to hear about<br>it. Yet it is the absolutely necessary counterpart of our world above.<br>Practically everything we do, from eating an ice to crossing the<br>Atlantic, and from baking a loaf to writing a novel, involves the use of<br>coal, directly or indirectly. For all the arts of peace coal is needed;<br>if war breaks out it is needed all the more. In time of revolution the<br>miner must go on working or the revolution must stop, for revolution as<br>much as reaction needs coal. Whatever may be happening on the surface,<br>the hacking and shovelling have got to continue without a pause, or at<br>any rate without pausing for more than a few weeks at the most. In order<br>that Hitler may march the goose-step, that the Pope may denounce<br>Bolshevism, that the cricket crowds may assemble at Lords, that the poets<br>may scratch one another's backs, coal has got to be forthcoming. But on<br>the whole we are not aware of it; we all know that we 'must have coal',<br>but we seldom or never remember what coal-getting involves. Here am I<br>sitting writing in front of my comfortable coal fire. It is April but I<br>still need a fire. Once a fortnight the coal cart drives up to the door<br>and men in leather jerkins carry the coal indoors in stout sacks smelling<br>of tar and shoot it clanking into the coal-hole under the stairs. It is<br>only very rarely, when I make a definite mental-effort, that I connect<br>this coal with that far-off labour in the mines. It is just 'coal'--<br>something that I have got to have; black stuff that arrives mysteriously<br>from nowhere in particular, like manna except that you have to pay for<br>it. You could quite easily drive a car right across the north of England<br>and never once remember that hundreds of feet below the road you are on<br>the miners are hacking at the coal. Yet in a sense it is the miners who<br>are driving your car forward. Their lamp-lit world down there is as<br>necessary to the daylight world above as the root is to the flower.<br><br>It is not long since conditions in the mines were worse than they are<br>now. There are still living a few very old women who in their youth have<br>worked underground, with the harness round their waists, and a chain that<br>passed between their legs, crawling on all fours and dragging tubs of<br>coal. They used to go on doing this even when they were pregnant. And<br>even now, if coal could not be produced without pregnant women dragging<br>it to and fro, I fancy we should let them do it rather than deprive<br>ourselves of coal. But-most of the time, of course, we should prefer to<br>forget that they were doing it. It is so with all types of manual work;<br>it keeps us alive, and we are oblivious of its existence. More than<br>anyone else, perhaps, the miner can stand as the type of the manual<br>worker, not only because his work is so exaggeratedly awful, but also<br>because it is so vitally necessary and yet so remote from our experience,<br>so invisible, as it were, that we are capable of forgetting it as we<br>forget the blood in our veins. In a way it is even humiliating to watch<br>coal-miners working. It raises in you a momentary doubt about your own<br>status as an 'intellectual' and a superior person generally. For it is<br>brought home to you, at least while you are watching, that it is only<br>because miners sweat their guts out that superior persons can remain<br>superior. You and I and the editor of the Times Lit. Supp., and the poets<br>and the Archbishop of Canterbury and Comrade X, author of Marxism for<br>Infants--all of us really owe the comparative decency of our lives to<br>poor drudges underground, blackened to the eyes, with their throats full<br>of coal dust, driving their shovels forward with arms and belly muscles<br>of steel.<br><br></font></p>
