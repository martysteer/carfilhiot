<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">About a year ago I and a number of others were engaged in broadcasting<br>literary programmes to India, and among other things we broadcast a good<br>deal of verse by contemporary and near-contemporary English writers--for<br>example, Eliot, Herbert Read, Auden, Spender, Dylan Thomas, Henry<br>Treece, Alex Comfort, Robert Bridges, Edmund Blunden, D.H. Lawrence.<br>Whenever it was possible we had poems broadcast by the people who wrote<br>them. Just why these particular programmes (a small and remote<br>out-flanking movement in the radio war) were instituted there is no need<br>to explain here, but I should add that the fact that we were<br>broadcasting to an Indian audience dictated our technique to some<br>extent. The essential point was that our literary broadcasts were aimed<br>at the Indian university students, a small and hostile audience,<br>unapproachable by anything that could be described as British<br>propaganda. It was known in advance that we could not hope for more than<br>a few thousand listeners at the most, and this gave us an excuse to be<br>more "highbrow" than is generally possible on the air.<br><br>If you are broadcasting poetry to people who know your language but<br>don't share your cultural background, a certain amount of comment and<br>explanation is unavoidable, and the formula we usually followed was to<br>broadcast what purported to be a monthly literary magazine. The<br>editorial staff were supposedly sitting in their office, discussing what<br>to put into the next number. Somebody suggested one poem, someone else<br>suggested another, there was a short discussion and then came the poem<br>itself, read in a different voice, preferably the author's own. This<br>poem naturally called up another, and so the programme continued,<br>usually with at least half a minute of discussion between any two items.<br>For a half-hour programme, six voices seemed to be the best number. A<br>programme of this sort was necessarily somewhat shapeless, but it could<br>be given a certain appearance of unity by making it revolve round a<br>single central theme. For example, one number of our imaginary magazine<br>was devoted to the subject of war. It included two poems by Edmund<br>Blunden, Auden's "September 1941 ", extracts from a long poem by G.S.<br>Fraser ("A Letter to Anne Ridler"), Byron's "Isles of Greece" and an<br>extract from T.E. Lawrence's REVOLT IN THE DESERT. These half-dozen<br>items, with the arguments that preceded and followed them, covered<br>reasonably well the possible attitudes towards war. The poems and the<br>prose extract took about twenty minutes to broadcast, the arguments<br>about eight minutes.<br><br>This formula may seem slightly ridiculous and also rather patronising,<br>but its advantage is that the element of mere instruction, the textbook<br>motif, which is quite unavoidable if one is going to broadcast serious<br>and sometimes "difficult" verse, becomes a lot less forbidding when it<br>appears as an informal discussion. The various speakers can ostensibly<br>say to one another what they are in reality saying to the audience.<br>Also, by such an approach you at least give a poem a context, which is<br>just what poetry lacks from the average man's point of view. But of<br>course there are other methods. One which we frequently used was to set<br>a poem in music. It is announced that in a few minutes' time such and<br>such a poem will be broadcast; then the music plays for perhaps a<br>minute, then fades out into the poem, which follows without any title or<br>announcement, then the music is faded again and plays up for another<br>minute or two--the whole thing taking perhaps five minutes. It is<br>necessary to choose appropriate music, but needless to say, the real<br>purpose of the music is to insulate the poem from the rest of the<br>programme. By this method you can have, say, a Shakespeare sonnet within<br>three minutes of a news bulletin without, at any rate to my ear, any<br>gross incongruity.<br><br>These programmes that I have been speaking of were of no great value in<br>themselves, but I have mentioned them because of the ideas they aroused<br>in myself and some others about the possibilities of the radio as a<br>means of popularising poetry. I was early struck by the fact that the<br>broadcasting of a poem by the person who wrote it does not merely<br>produce an effect upon the audience, if any, but also on the poet<br>himself. One must remember that extremely little in the way of<br>broadcasting poetry has been done in England, and that many people who<br>write verse have never even considered the idea of reading it aloud. By<br>being set down at a microphone, especially if this happens at all<br>regularly, the poet is brought into a new relationship with his work,<br>not otherwise attainable in our time and country. It is a commonplace<br>that in modern times--the last two hundred years, say--poetry has come to<br>have less and less connection either with music or with the spoken word.<br>It needs print in order to exist at all, and it is no more expected that<br>a poet, as such, will know how to sing or even to declaim than it is<br>expected that an architect will know how to plaster a ceiling. Lyrical<br>and rhetorical poetry have almost ceased to be written, and a hostility<br>towards poetry on the part of the common man has come to be taken for<br>granted in any country where everyone can read. And where such a breach<br>exists it is always inclined to widen, because the concept of poetry as<br>primarily something printed, and something intelligible only to a<br>minority, encourages obscurity and "cleverness". How many people do not<br>feel quasi-instinctively that there must be something wrong with any poem<br>whose meaning can be taken in at a single glance? It seems unlikely that<br>these tendencies will be checked unless it again becomes normal to read<br>verse aloud, and it is difficult to see how this can be brought about<br>except by using the radio as a medium. But the special advantage of the<br>radio, its power to select the right audience, and to do away with<br>stage-fright and embarrassment, ought here to be noticed.<br><br>In broadcasting your audience is conjectural, but it is an audience of<br>ONE. Millions may be listening, but each is listening alone, or as a<br>member of a small group, and each has (or ought to have) the feeling<br>that you are speaking to him individually. More than this, it is<br>reasonable to assume that your audience is sympathetic, or at least<br>interested, for anyone who is bored can promptly switch you off by<br>turning a knob. But though presumably sympathetic, the audience HAS NO<br>POWER OVER YOU. It is just here that a broadcast differs from a speech<br>or a lecture. On the platform, as anyone used to public speaking knows,<br>it is almost impossible not to take your tone from the audience. It is<br>always obvious within a few minutes what they will respond to and what<br>they will not, and in practice you are almost compelled to speak for the<br>benefit of what you estimate as the stupidest person present, and also<br>to ingratiate yourself by means of the ballyhoo known as "personality".<br>If you don't do so, the result is always an atmosphere of frigid<br>embarrassment. That grisly thing, a "poetry reading", is what it is<br>because there will always be some among the audience who are bored or<br>all but frankly hostile and who can't remove themselves by the simple<br>act of turning a knob. And it is at bottom the same difficulty--the fact<br>that a theatre audience is not a selected one--that makes it impossible<br>to get a decent performance of Shakespeare in England. On the air these<br>conditions do not exist. The poet FEELS that he is addressing people to<br>whom poetry means something, and it is a fact that poets who are used to<br>broadcasting can read into the microphone with a virtuosity they would<br>not equal if they had a visible audience in front of them. The element<br>of make-believe that enters here does not greatly matter. The point is<br>that in the only way now possible the poet has been brought into a<br>situation in which reading verse aloud seems a natural unembarrassing<br>thing, a normal exchange between man and man: also he has been led to<br>think of his work as SOUND rather than as a pattern on paper. By that<br>much the reconciliation between poetry and the common man is nearer. It<br>already exists at the poet's end of the aether-waves, whatever may be<br>happening at the other end.<br><br>However, what is happening at the other end cannot be disregarded. It<br>will be seen that I have been speaking as though the whole subject of<br>poetry were embarrassing, almost indecent, as though popularising poetry<br>were essentially a strategic manoeuvre, like getting a dose of medicine<br>down a child's throat or establishing tolerance for a persecuted sect.<br>But unfortunately that or something like it is the case. There can be no<br>doubt that in our civilisation poetry is by far the most discredited of<br>the arts, the only art, indeed, in which the average man refuses to<br>discern any value. Arnold Bennett was hardly exaggerating when he said<br>that in the English-speaking countries the word "poetry" would disperse<br>a crowd quicker than a fire-hose. And as I have pointed out, a breach of<br>this kind tends to widen simply because of its existence, the common man<br>becoming more and more anti-poetry, the poet more and more arrogant and<br>unintelligible, until the divorce between poetry and popular culture is<br>accepted as a sort of law of nature, although in fact it belongs only to<br>our own time and to a comparatively small area of the earth. We live in<br>an age in which the average human being in the highly civilised<br>countries is aesthetically inferior to the lowest savage. This state of<br>affairs is generally looked upon as being incurable by any CONSCIOUS<br>act, and on the other hand is expected to right itself of its own accord<br>as soon as society takes a comelier shape. With slight variations the<br>Marxist, the Anarchist and the religious believer will all tell you<br>this, and in broad terms it is undoubtedly true. The ugliness amid which<br>we live has spiritual and economic causes and is not to be explained by<br>the mere going-astray of tradition at some point or other. But it does<br>not follow that no improvement is possible within our present framework,<br>nor that an aesthetic improvement is not a necessary part of the general<br>redemption of society. It is worth stopping to wonder, therefore,<br>whether it would not be possible even now to rescue poetry from its<br>special position as the most hated of the arts and win for it at least<br>the same degree of toleration as exists for music. But one has to start<br>by asking, in what way and to what extent is poetry unpopular?<br><br>On the face of it, the unpopularity of poetry is as complete as it could<br>be. But on second thoughts, this has to be qualified in a rather<br>peculiar way. To begin with, there is still an appreciable amount of<br>folk poetry (nursery rhymes etc) which is universally known and quoted<br>and forms part of the background of everyone's mind. There is also a<br>handful of ancient songs and ballads which have never gone out of<br>favour. In addition there is the popularity, or at least the toleration,<br>of "good bad" poetry, generally of a patriotic or sentimental kind. This<br>might seem beside the point if it were not that "good bad" poetry has<br>all the characteristics which, ostensibly, make the average man dislike<br>true poetry. It is in verse, it rhymes, it deals in lofty sentiments and<br>unusual language--all this to a very marked degree, for it is almost<br>axiomatic that bad poetry is more "poetical" than good poetry. Yet if<br>not actively liked it is at least tolerated. For example, just before<br>writing this I have been listening to a couple of BBC comedians doing<br>their usual turn before the 9 o'clock news. In the last three minutes<br>one of the two comedians suddenly announces that he "wants to be serious<br>for a moment" and proceeds to recite a piece of patriotic balderdash<br>entitled "A Fine Old English Gentleman", in praise of His Majesty the<br>King. Now, what is the reaction of the audience to this sudden lapse<br>into the worst sort of rhyming heroics? It cannot be very violently<br>negative, or there would be a sufficient volume of indignant letters to<br>stop the BBC doing this kind of thing. One must conclude that though the<br>big public is hostile to POETRY, it is not strongly hostile to VERSE.<br>After all, if rhyme and metre were disliked for their own sakes, neither<br>songs nor dirty limericks could be popular. Poetry is disliked because<br>it is associated with untelligibility, intellectual pretentiousness and<br>a general feeling of Sunday-on-a-weekday. Its name creates in advance<br>the same sort of bad impression as the word "God", or a parson's<br>dog-collar. To a certain extent, popularising poetry is a question of<br>breaking down an acquired inhibition. It is a question of getting people<br>to listen instead of uttering a mechanical raspberry. If true poetry<br>could be introduced to the big public in such a way as to make it seem<br>NORMAL, as that piece of rubbish I have just listened to presumably<br>seemed normal, then part of the prejudice against it might be overcome.<br><br>It is difficult to believe that poetry can ever be popularised again<br>without some deliberate effort at the education of public taste,<br>involving strategy and perhaps even subterfuge. T.S. Eliot once<br>suggested that poetry, particularly dramatic poetry, might be brought<br>back into the consciousness of ordinary people through the medium of the<br>music hall; he might have added the pantomime, whose vast possibilities<br>do not seem ever to have been completely explored. "Sweeney Agonistes"<br>was perhaps written with some such idea in mind, and it would in fact be<br>conceivable as a music-hall turn, or at least as a scene in a revue. I<br>have suggested the radio as a more hopeful medium, and I have pointed<br>out its technical advantages, particularly from the point of view of the<br>poet. The reason why such a suggestion sounds hopeless at first hearing<br>is that few people are able to imagine the radio being used for the<br>dissemination of anything except tripe. People listen to the stuff that<br>does actually dribble from the loud-speakers of the world, and conclude<br>that it is for that and nothing else that the wireless exists. Indeed<br>the very word "wireless" calls up a picture either of roaring dictators<br>or of genteel throaty voices announcing that three of our aircraft have<br>failed to return. Poetry on the air sounds like the Muses in striped<br>trousers. Nevertheless one ought not to confuse the capabilities of an<br>instrument with the use it is actually put to. Broadcasting is what it<br>is, not because there is something inherently vulgar, silly and<br>dishonest about the whole apparatus of microphone and transmitter, but<br>because all the broadcasting that now happens all over the world is<br>under the control of governments or great monopoly companies which are<br>actively interested in maintaining the STATUS QUO and therefore in<br>preventing the common man from becoming too intelligent. Something of<br>the same kind has happened to the cinema, which, like the radio, made<br>its appearance during the monopoly stage of capitalism and is<br>fantastically expensive to operate. In all the arts the tendency is<br>similar. More and more the channels of production are under the control<br>of bureaucrats, whose aim is to destroy the artist or at least to<br>castrate him. This would be a bleak outlook if it were not that the<br>totalitarianisation which is now going on, and must undoubtedly continue<br>to go on, in every country of the world, is mitigated by another process<br>which it was not easy to foresee even as short a time as five years ago.<br><br>This is, that the huge bureaucratic machines of which we are all part<br>are beginning to work creakily because of their mere size and their<br>constant growth. The tendency of the modern state is to wipe out the<br>freedom of the intellect, and yet at the same time every state,<br>especially under the pressure of war, finds itself more and more in need<br>of an intelligentsia to do its publicity for it. The modern state needs,<br>for example, pamphlet-writers, poster artists, illustrators,<br>broadcasters, lecturers, film producers, actors, song composers, even<br>painters and sculptors, not to mention psychologists, sociologists,<br>bio-chemists, mathematicians and what not. The British Government<br>started the present war with the more or less openly declared intention<br>of keeping the literary intelligentsia out of it; yet after three years<br>of war almost every writer, however undesirable his political history or<br>opinions, has been sucked into the various Ministries or the BBC and<br>even those who enter the armed forces tend to find themselves after a<br>while in Public Relations or some other essentially literary job. The<br>Government has absorbed these people, unwillingly enough, because it<br>found itself unable to get on without them. The ideal, from the official<br>point of view, would have been to put all publicity into the hands of<br>"safe" people like A.P. Herbert or Ian Hay: but since not enough of<br>these were available, the existing intelligentsia had to be utilised,<br>and the tone and even to some extent the content of official propaganda<br>have been modified accordingly. No one acquainted with the Government<br>pamphlets, ABCA (The Army Bureau of Current Affairs.) lectures,<br>documentary films and broadcasts to occupied countries which have been<br>issued during the past two years imagines that our rulers would sponsor<br>this kind of thing if they could help it. Only, the bigger the machine<br>of government becomes, the more loose ends and forgotten corners there<br>are in it. This is perhaps a small consolation, but it is not a<br>despicable one. It means that in countries where there is already<br>a strong liberal tradition, bureaucratic tyranny can perhaps never<br>be complete. The striped-trousered ones will rule, but so long as<br>they are forced to maintain an intelligentsia, the intelligentsia<br>will have a certain amount of autonomy. If the Government needs,<br>for example, documentary films, it must employ people specially<br>interested in the technique of the film, and it must allow them the<br>necessary minimum of freedom; consequently, films that are all wrong<br>from the bureaucratic point of view will always have a tendency to<br>appear. So also with painting, photography, scriptwriting, reportage,<br>lecturing and all the other arts and half-arts of which a complex modern<br>state has need.<br><br>The application of this to the radio is obvious. At present the<br>loudspeaker is the enemy of the creative writer, but this may not<br>necessarily remain true when the volume and scope of broadcasting<br>increase. As things are, although the BBC does keep up a feeble show of<br>interest in contemporary literature, it is harder to capture five<br>minutes on the air in which to broadcast a poem than twelve hours in<br>which to disseminate lying propaganda, tinned music, stale jokes, faked<br>"discussions" or what-have-you. But that state of affairs may alter in<br>the way I have indicated, and when that time comes serious experiment in<br>the broadcasting of verse, with complete disregard for the various<br>hostile influences which prevent any such thing at present, would become<br>possible. I don't claim it as certain that such an experiment would have<br>very great results. The radio was bureaucratised so early in its career<br>that the relationship between broadcasting and literature has never been<br>thought out. It is not certain that the microphone is the instrument by<br>which poetry could be brought back to the common people and it is not<br>even certain that poetry would gain by being more of a spoken and less<br>of a written thing. But I do urge that these possibilities exist, and<br>that those who care for literature might turn their minds more often to<br>this much-despised medium, whose powers for good have perhaps been<br>obscured by the voices of Professor Joad and Doctor Goebbels.<br><br></font></p>
