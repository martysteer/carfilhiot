<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">A few weeks ago, five people who were selling papers outside Hyde Park<br>were arrested by the police for obstruction. When taken before the<br>magistartes, they were all found guilty, four of them being bound over<br>for six months and the other sentenced to forty shillings fine or a<br>month's imprisonments. He preferred to serve his term.<br><br>The papers these people were selling were PEACE NEWS, FORWARD and<br>FREEDOM, besides other kindred literature. PEACE NEWS is the organ of the<br>Peace Pledge Union, FREEDOM (till recently called WAR COMMENTARY) is that<br>of the Anarchists; as for FORWARD, its politics defy definition, but at<br>any rate it is violently Left. The magistrate, in passing sentence,<br>stated that he was not influenced by the nature of the literature that<br>was being sold; he was concerned merely with the fact of obstruction, and<br>that this offence had technically been committed.<br><br>This raises several important points. To begin with, how does the law<br>stand on the subject? As far as I can discover, selling newspapers in the<br>street is technically an obstruction, at any rate if you fail to move<br>when the police tell you to. So it would be legally possible for any<br>policeman who felt like it to arrest any newsboy for selling the EVENING<br>NEWS. Obviously this doesn't happen, so that the enforcement of the law<br>depends on the discretion of the police.<br><br>And what makes the police decide to arrest one man rather than another?<br>However it may be with the magistrate, I find it hard to believe that in<br>this case the police were not influenced by political considerations. It<br>is a bit too much of a coincidence that they should have picked on people<br>selling just those papers.<br><br>If they had also arrested someone selling TRUTH, or the TABLET, or the<br>SPECTATOR, or even the CHURCH TIMES, their impartiality would be easier<br>to believe in.<br><br>The British police are not like the continental GENDARMERIE or Gestapo,<br>but I do not think [sic] one maligns them in saying that, in the past,<br>they have been unfriendly to Left-wing activities. They have generally<br>shown a tendency to side with those whom they regarded as the defenders<br>of private property. Till quite recently "red" and "illegal" were almost<br>synonymous, and it was always the seller of, say the DAILY WORKER, never<br>the seller of say, the DAILY TELEGRAPH, who was moved on and generally<br>harassed. Apparently it can be the same, at any rate at moments, under a<br>Labour Government.<br><br>A thing I would like to know--it is a thing we hear very little about--<br>is what changes are made in the administrative personnel when there has<br>been a change of government.. Does a police officer who has a vague<br>notion that "Socialism" means something against the law carry on just the<br>same when the government itself is Socialist?<br><br>When a Labour government takes over, I wonder what happens to Scotland<br>Yard Special Branch? To Military Intelligence? We are not told, but such<br>symptoms as there are do not suggest that any very extensive shuffling is<br>going on.<br><br>However, the main point of this episode is that the sellers of newspapers<br>and pamphlets should be interfered with at all. Which particular minority<br>is singled out--whether Pacifists, Communists, Anarchists, Jehovah's<br>Witness of the Legion of Christian Reformers who recently declared Hitler<br>to be Jesus Christ--is a secondary matter. It is of symptomatic<br>importance that these people should have been arrested at that particular<br>spot. You are not allowed to sell literature inside Hyde Park, but for<br>many years past it has been usual for the paper-sellers to station<br>themselves outside the gates and distribute literature connected with the<br>open air meetings a hundred yards away. Every kind of publication has<br>been sold there without interference.<br><br>The degree of freedom of the press existing in this country is often<br>over-rated. Technically there is great freedom, but the fact that most of<br>the press is owned by a few people operates in much the same way as State<br>censorship. On the other hand, freedom of speech is real. On a platform,<br>or in certain recognised open air spaces like Hyde Park, you can say<br>almost anything, and, what is perhaps more significant, no one is<br>frightened to utter his true opinions in pubs, on the tops of busses, and<br>so forth.<br><br>The point is that the relative freedom which we enjoy depends of public<br>opinion. The law is no protection. Governments make laws, but whether<br>they are carried out, and how the police behave, depends on the general<br>temper in the country. If large numbers of people are interested in<br>freedom of speech, there will be freedom of speech, even if the law<br>forbids it; if public opinion is sluggish, inconvenient minorities will<br>be persecuted, even if laws exist to protect them. The decline in the<br>desire for individual liberty has not been so sharp as I would have<br>predicted six years ago, when the war was starting, but still there has<br>been a decline. The notion that certain opinions cannot safely be allowed<br>a hearing is growing. It is given currency by intellectuals who confuse<br>the issue by not distinguishing between democratic opposition and open<br>rebellion, and it is reflected in our growing indifference to tyranny and<br>injustice abroad. And even those who declare themselves to be in favour<br>of freedom of opinion generally drop their claim when it is their own<br>adversaries who are being prosecutued.<br><br>I am not suggesting that the arrest of five people for selling harmless<br>newspapers is a major calamity. When you see what is happening in the<br>world today, it hardly seems worth squeeling about such a tiny incident.<br>All the same, it is not a good syptom that such things should happen when<br>the war is well over, and I should feel happier if this and the long<br>series of similar episodes that have preceded it, were capable of raising<br>a genuine popular clamour, and not merely a mild flutter in sections of<br>the minority press.<br><br></font></p>
