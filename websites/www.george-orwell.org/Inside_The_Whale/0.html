<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">I<br><br>When Henry Miller's novel, TROPIC OF CANCER, appeared in 1935, it was<br>greeted with rather cautious praise, obviously conditioned in some cases<br>by a fear of seeming to enjoy pornography. Among the people who praised<br>it were T. S. Eliot, Herbert Read, Aldous Huxley, John dos Passes, Ezra<br>Pound--on the whole, not the writers who are in fashion at this moment.<br>And in fact the subject matter ofthebook, and to a certain extent its<br>mental atmosphere, belong to the twenties rather than to the thirties.<br><br>TROPIC OF CANCER is a novel in the first person, or autobiography in the<br>form of a novel, whichever way you like to look at it. Miller himself<br>insists that it is straight autobiography, but the tempo and method of<br>telling the story are those of a novel. It is a story of the American<br>Paris, but not along quite the usual lines, because the Americans who<br>figure in it happen to be people without money. During the boom years,<br>when dollars were plentiful and the exchange-value of the franc was low,<br>Paris was invaded by such a swarm of artists, writers, students,<br>dilettanti, sight-seers, debauchees, and plain idlers as the world has<br>probably never seen. In some quarters of the town the so-called artists<br>must actually have outnumbered the working population--indeed, it has<br>been reckoned thatm the late twenties ther were as many as 30,000<br>painters in Paris, most of them impostors. The populace had grown so<br>hardened to artists that gruff-voiced lesbians in corduroy breeches and<br>young men in Grecian or medieval costume could walk the streets without<br>attracting a glance, and along the Seine banks Notre Dame it was almost<br>impossible to pick one's way between the sketching-stools. It was the age<br>of dark horses and neglected genii; the phrase on everybody's lips was<br>'QUAND JE SERAI LANCÉ'. As it turned out, nobody was 'LANCÉ', the slump<br>descended like another Ice Age, the cosmopolitan mob of artists vanished,<br>and the huge Montparnasse cafés which only ten years ago were filled till<br>the small hours by hordes of shrieking poseurs have turned into darkened<br>tombs in which there arc not even any ghosts. It is this world--<br>described in, among other novels, Wyndham Lewis's TARR--that Miller is<br>writing about, but he is dealing only with the under side of it, the<br>lumpen-proletarian fringe which has been able to survive the slump<br>because it is composed partly of genuine artists and partly of genuine<br>scoundrels. The neglected genii, the paranoiacs who art always 'going to'<br>write the novel that will knock Proust into a cocked hat, are there, but<br>they are only genii in the rather rare moments when they are not scouting<br>about for the next meal. For the most part it is a story of bug-ridden<br>rooms in working-men's hotels, of fights, drinking bouts, cheap brothels,<br>Russian refugees, cadging, swindling, and temporary jobs. And the whole<br>atmosphere of the poor quarters of Paris as a foreigner sees them--the<br>cobbled alleys, the sour reek of refuse, the bistros with their greasy<br>zinc counters and worn brick floors, the green waters of the Seine, the<br>blue cloaks of the Republican Guard, the crumbling iron urinals, the<br>peculiar sweetish smell of the Metro stations, the cigarettes that come<br>to pieces, the pigeons in the Luxembourg Gardens--it is all there, or at<br>any rate the feeling of it is there.<br><br>On the face of it no material could be less promising. When TROPIC OF<br>CANCER was published the Italians were marching into Abyssinia and<br>Hitler's concentration camps were already bulging. The intellectual foci<br>of the world were Rome, Moscow, and Berlin. It did not seem to be a<br>moment at which a novel of outstanding value was likely to be written<br>about American dead-beats cadging drinks in the Latin Quarter. Of course<br>a novelist is not obliged to write directly about contemporary history,<br>but a novelist who simply disregards the major public events of the<br>moment is generally either a footler or a plain idiot. From a mere<br>account of the subject matter of TROPIC OF CANCER most people would<br>probably assume it to be no more thatt a bit of naughty-naughty left over<br>from the twenties. Actually, nearly everyone who read it saw at once that<br>it was nothing of the kind, but a very remarkable book. How or why<br>remarkable? That question is never easy to answer. It is better to begin<br>by describing the impression that TROPIC OF CANCER has left on my own<br>mind.<br><br>When I first opened TROPIC OF CANCER and saw that it was full of<br>unprintable words, my immediate reaction was a refusal to be impressed.<br>Most people's would be the same, I believe. Nevertheless, after a lapse<br>of time the atmosphere of the book, besides innumerable details, seemed<br>to linger in my memory in a peculiar way. A year later Miller's second<br>book, BLACK SPRING, was published. By this tim? TROPIC OF CANCER was much<br>more vividly present in my mind than it had been when I first read it. My<br>first feeling about BLACK SPRING was that it showed a falling-off, and it<br>is a fact that it has not the same unity as the other book. Yet after<br>another year there were many passages in BLACK SPRING that had also<br>rooted themselves in my memory. Evidently these books are of the sort to<br>leave a flavour behind them--books that 'create a world of their own',<br>as the saying goes. The books that do this are not necessarily good<br>books, they may be good bad books like RAFFLES or the SHERLOCK HOLMES<br>stories, or perverse and morbid books like WUTHERING HEIGHTS or THE HOUSE<br>WITH THE GREEN SHUTTERS. But now and again there appears a novel which<br>opens up a new world not by revealing what is strange, but by revealing<br>what is familiar. The truly remarkable thing about ULYSSES, for instance,<br>is the commonplaceness of its material. Of course there is much more in<br>ULYSSES than this, because Joyce is a kind of poet and also an<br>elephantine pedant, but his real achievement has been to get the familiar<br>on to paper. He dared--for it is a matter of DARING just as much as of<br>technique--to expose the imbecilities of the inner mind, and in doing so<br>he discovered an America which was under everybody's nose. Here is a<br>whole world of stuff which you supposed to be of its nature<br>incommunicable, and somebody has managed to communicate it. The effect is<br>to break down, at any rate momentarily, the solitude in which the human<br>being lives. When you read certain passages in ULYSSES you feel that<br>Joyce's mind and your mind are one, that he knows all about you though he<br>has never heard your name, that there some world outside time and space<br>in which you and he are together. And though he does not resemble Joyce<br>in other ways, there is a touch of this quality in Henry Miller. Not<br>everywhere, because his work is very uneven, and sometimes, especially in<br>BLACK SPRING, tends to slide away into more verbiage or into the squashy<br>universe of the surresalists. But read him for five pages, ten pages, and<br>you feel the peculiar relief that comes not so much from understanding as<br>from being UNDERSTOOD. 'He knows all about me,' you feel; 'he wrote this<br>specially for me'. It is as though you could hear a voice speaking to<br>you, a friendly Amierican voice, with no humbug in it, no moral purpose,<br>merely an implicit assumption that we are all alike. For the moment you<br>have got away from the lies and simplifications, the stylized,<br>marionette-like quality of ordinary fiction, even quite good fiction, and<br>are dealing with the recognizable experiences of human beings.<br><br>But what kind of experience? What kind of human beings? Miller is writing<br>about the man in the street, and it is incidentally rather a pity that it<br>should be a street full of brothers. That is the penalty of leaving your<br>native land. It means transferring your roots into shallower soil. Exile<br>is probably more damaging to a novelist than to a painter or even a poet,<br>because its effect is to take him out of contact with working life and<br>narrow down his range to the street, the cafe, the church, the brothel<br>and the studio. On the whole, in Miller's books you are reading about<br>people living the expatriate life, people drinking, talking, meditating,<br>and fornicating, not about people working, marrying, and bringing up<br>children; a pity, because he would have described the one set of<br>activities as well as the other. In BLACK SPRING there is a wonderful<br>flashback of New York, the swarming Irish-infested New York of the O.<br>Henry period, but the Paris scenes are the best, and, granted their utter<br>worthlessness as social types, the drunks and dead-beats of the cafes are<br>handled with a feeling for character and a mastery of technique that are<br>unapproached in any at all recent novel. All of them are not only<br>credible but completely familiar; you have the feeling that all their<br>adventures have happened to yourself. Not that they are anything very<br>startling in the way of adventures. Henry gets a job with a melancholy<br>Indian student, gets another job at a dreadful French school during a<br>cold snap when the lavatories are frozen solid, goes on drinking bouts in<br>Le Havre with his friend Collins, the sea captain, goes tse brothels<br>where there are wonderful Negresses, talks with his friend Van Norden,<br>the novelist, who has got the great novel of the world in his head but<br>can never bring himself to begin writing it. His friend Karl, on the<br>verge of starvation, is picked up by a wealthy widow who wishes to marry<br>him. There are interminable Hamlet-like conversations in which Karl tries<br>to decide which is worse, being hungry or sleeping with an old woman. In<br>great detail he describes his visits to the widow, how he went to the<br>hotel dressed in his best, how before going in he neglected to urinate,<br>so that the whole evening was one long crescendo of torment etc., etc.<br>And after all, none of it is true, the widow doesn't even exist--Karl<br>has simply invented her in order to make himself seem important. The<br>whole book is in this vein, more or less. Why is it that these monstrous<br>trivialities are so engrossing? Simply because the whole atmosphere is<br>deeply familiar, because you have all the while the feeling that these<br>things are happening to YOU. And you have this feeling because somebody<br>has chosen to drop the Geneva language of the ordinary novel and drag the<br>REAL-POLITIK of the inner mind into the open. In Miller's case it is not<br>so much a question of exploring the mechanisms of the mind as of owning<br>up to everyday facts and everyday emotions. For the truth is that many<br>ordinary people, perhaps an actual majority, do speak and behave in just<br>the way that is recorded here. The callous coarseness with which the<br>characters in TROPIC OF CANCER talk is very rare in fiction, but it is<br>extremely common in real life; again and again I have heard just such<br>conversations from people who were not even aware that they were talking<br>coarsely. It is worth noticing that TROPIC OF CANCER is not a young man's<br>book. Miller was in his forties when it was published, and though since<br>then he has produced three or four others, it is obvious that this first<br>book had been lived with for years. It is one of those books that are<br>slowly matured in poverty and obscurity, by people who know what they<br>have got to do and therefore are able to wait. The prose is astonishing,<br>and in parts of BLACK SPRING is even better. Unfortunately I cannot<br>quote; unprintable words occur almost everywhere. But get hold of TROPIC<br>OF CANCER, get hold of BLACK SPRING and read especially the first hundred<br>pages. They give you an idea of what can still be done, even at this late<br>date, with English prose. In them, English is treated as a spoken<br>language, but spoken WITHOUT FEAR, i.e. without fear of rhetoric or of<br>the unusual or poetical word. The adjective has come back, after its ten<br>years' exile. It is a flowing, swelling prose, a prose with rhythms in<br>it, something quite different from the flat cautious statements and<br>snack-bar dialects that are now in fashion.<br><br>When a book like TROPIC OF CANCER appears, it is only natural that the<br>first thing people notice should be its obscenity. Given our current<br>notions of literary decency, it is not at all easy to approach an<br>unprintable book with detachment. Either one is shocked and disgusted, or<br>one is morbidly thrilled, or one is determined above all else not to be<br>impressed. The last is probably the commonest reaction, with the result<br>that unprintable books often get less attention than they deserve. It is<br>rather the fashion to say that nothing is easier than to write an obscene<br>book, that people only do it in order to get themselves talked about and<br>make money, etc., etc. What makes it obvious that this is not the case is<br>that books which are obscene in the police-court sense are distinctly<br>uncommon. If there were easy money to be made out of dirty words, a lot<br>more people would be making it. But, because 'obscene' books do not<br>appear very frequently, there is a tendency to lump them together, as a<br>rule quite unjustifiably. TROPIC OF CANCER has been vaguely associated<br>with two other books, ULYSSES and VOYAGE AU BOUT DE LA NUIT, but in<br>neither case is there much resemblance. What Miller has in common with<br>Joyce is a willingness to mention the inane, squalid facts of everyday<br>life. Putting aside differences of technique, the funeral scene in<br>ULYSSES, for instance, would fit into TROPIC OF CANCER; the whole chapter<br>is a sort of confession, an exposé of the frightful inner callousness of<br>the human being. But there the resemblance ends. As a novel, TROPIC OF<br>CANCER is far inferior to ULYSSES. Joyce is an artist, in a sense in<br>which Miller is not and probably would not wish to be, and in any case he<br>is attempting much more. He is exploring different states of<br>consciousness, dream, reverie (the 'bronze-by-gold' chapter),<br>drunkenness, etc., and dovetailing them all into a huge complex pattern,<br>almost like a Victorian 'plot'. Miller is simply a hard-boiled person<br>talking about life, an ordinary American businessman with intellectual<br>courage and a gift for words. It is perhaps significant that he looks<br>exactly like everyone's idea of an American businessman. As for the<br>comparison with VOYAGE AU BOUT DE LA NUIT, it is even further from the<br>point. Both books, use unprintable words, both are in some sense<br>autobiographical, but that is all. VOYAGE AU BEUT DE LA NUIT is a<br>book-with-a-purpose, and its purpose is to protest against the horror and<br>meaninglessness of modern life--actually, indeed, of LIFE. It is a cry<br>of unbearable disgust, a voice from the cesspool. TROPIC OF CANCER is<br>almost exactly the opposite. The thing has become so unusual as to seem<br>almost anomalous, but it is the book of a man who is happy. So is BLACK<br>SPRING, though slightly less so, because tinged in places with nostalgia.<br>With years of lumpen-proletarian life behind him, hunger, vagabondage,<br>dirt, failure, nights in the open, battles with immigration officers,<br>endless struggles for a bit of cash, Miller finds that he is enjoying<br>himself. Exactly the aspects of life that feel Céline with horror are the<br>ones that appeal to him. So far from protesting, he is ACCEPTING. And the<br>very word 'acceptance' calls up his real affinity, another American, Walt<br>Whitman.<br><br>But there is something rather curious in being Whitman in the<br>nineteen-thirties. It is not certain that if Whitman himself were alive<br>at the moment he would write anything in the least degree resembling<br>LEAVES OF GRASS. For what he is saying, after all, is 'I accept', and<br>there is a radical difference between acceptance now and acceptance then.<br>Whitman was writing in a time of unexampled prosperity, but more than<br>that, he was writing in a country where freedom was something more than a<br>word. The democracy, equality, and comradeship that he is always talking<br>about arc not remote ideals, but something that existed in front of his<br>eyes. In mid-nineteenth-century America men felt themselves free and<br>equal, WERE free and equal, so far as that is possible outside-a society<br>of pure communism. There was povery and there were even class<br>distinctions, but except for the Negroes there was no permanently<br>submerged class. Everyone had inside him, like a kind of core, the,<br>iteaowledge that he could earn a decent living, and earn it without<br>bootlicking. When you read about Mark Twain's Mississippi raftsmen and<br>pilots, or Bret Harte's Western gold-miners, they seem more remote than<br>the cannibals of the Stone Age. The reason is simply that they are free<br>human beings. But it is the same even with the peaceful domesticated<br>America of the Eastern states, the America of the LITTLE WOMEN, HELEN'S<br>BABIES, and RIDING DOWN FROM BANGOR. Life has a buoyant, carefree quality<br>that you can feel as you read, like a physical sensation in your belly.<br>If is this that Whitman is celebrating, though actually he does it very<br>badly, because he is one of those writers who tell you what you ought to<br>feel instead of making you feel it. Luckilly for his beliefs, perhaps, he<br>died too early to see the deterioration in American life that came with<br>the rise of large-scale industry and the exploiting of cheap immigrant<br>labour.<br><br>Millers outlook is deeply akin to that of Whitman, and neaarly everyone<br>who has read him has remarked on this. TROPIC OF CANCER ends with an<br>especially Whitmanesque passage, in which, after the lecheries, the<br>swindles, the fights, the drinking bouts, and the imbecilities, he simply<br>sits down and watches the Seine flowing past, in a sort of mystical<br>acceptance of thihg-as-it-is. Only, what is he accepting? In the first<br>place, not America, but the ancient bone-heap of Europe, where every<br>grain of soil has passed through innumerable human bodies. Secondly, not<br>an epoch of expansion and liberty, but an epoch of fear, tyranny, and<br>regimentation. To say 'I accept' in an age like our own is to say that<br>you accept concentration camps, rubber truncheons. Hitler, Stalin, bombs,<br>aeroplanes, tinned food, machine guns, putsches, purges, slogans, Bedaux<br>belts, gas masks, submarines, spies, PROVOCATEURS, press censorship,<br>secret prisons, aspirins, Hollywood films, and political murders. Not<br>only those things, of course, but, those things among-others. And on the<br>whole this is Henry Miller's attitude. Not quite always, because at<br>moments he shows signs of a fairly ordinary kind of literary nostalgia.<br>There is a long passage in the earlier part of BLACK SPRING, in praise of<br>the Middle Ages, which as prose must be one of the most remarkable pieces<br>of writing in recent years, but which displays an attitude not very<br>different from that of Chesterton. In MAX AND THE WHITE PHAGOCYTES there<br>is an attack on modern American civilization (breakfast cereals,<br>cellophane, etc.) from the usual angle of the literary man who hates<br>industrialism. But in general the attitude is 'Let's swallow it whole'.<br>And hence the seeming preocupation with indecency and with the<br>dirty-handkerchief sidd of life. It is only seeming, for the truth is<br>that ordinary everyday life consists far more largely of horrors than<br>writers of fiction usually care to admit. Whitman himself 'accepted' a<br>great deal that his contemporaries found unmentionable. For he is not<br>only writing of the prairie, he also wanders through the city and notes<br>the shattered skull of the suicide, the 'grey sick faces of onanists',<br>etc, etc. But unquestionably our own age, at any rate in Western Europe,<br>is less healthy and less hopeful than the age in which Whitman was<br>writing. Unlike Whitman, we live in a SHRINKING world. The 'democratic<br>vistas' have ended in barbed wire. There is less feeling of creation and<br>growth, less and less emphasis on the cradle, endlessly rocking, more and<br>more emphasis on the teapot, endlessly stewing. To accept civilization as<br>it is practically means accepting decay. It has ceased to be a strenuous<br>attitude and become a passive attitude--even 'decadent', if that word<br>means anything.<br><br>But precisely because, in one sense, he is passive to experience. Miller<br>is able to get nearer to the ordinary man than is possible to more<br>purposive writers. For the ordinary man is also passive. Within a narrow<br>circle (home life, and perhaps the trade union or local politics) he<br>feels himself master of his fate, but against major events he is as<br>helpless as against the elements. So far from endeavouring to influence<br>the future, he simply lies down and lets things happen to him. During the<br>past ten years literature has involved itself more and more deeply in<br>politics, with the result that there is now less room in it for the<br>ordinary man than at any time during the past two centuries. One can see<br>the change in the prevailing literary attitude by comparing the books<br>written about the Spanish civil war with those written about the war of<br>1914-18. The immediately striking thing about the Spanish war books, at<br>any rate those written in English, is their shocking dullness and<br>badness. But what is more significant is that almost all of them,<br>right-wing or left-wing, are written from a political angle, by cocksure<br>partisans telling you what to think, whereas the books about the Great<br>War were written by common soldiers or junior officers who did not even<br>pretend to understand what the whole thing was about. Books like ALL<br>QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, LE FEU, A FAREWELL TO ARMS, DEATH OF A HERO,<br>GOOD-BYE TO ALL THAT, MEMOIRS OF AN INFANTRY OFFICER, and A SUBALTERN ON<br>THE SOMME were written not by propagandists but by VICTIMS. They are<br>saying in effect, 'What the hell is all this about? God knows. All we can<br>do is to endure.' And though he is not writing about war, nor, on the<br>whole, about unhappiness, this is nearer to Miller's attitude than the<br>omniscience which is now fashionable. The BOOSTER, a short-lived<br>periodical of which he was part-editor, used to describe itself in its<br>advertisements as 'non-political, non-educational, non-progressive,<br>non-co-operative, non-ethical, non-literary, non-consistent,<br>non-contemporary', and Miller's own work could be described in nearly the<br>same terms. It is a voice from the crowd, from the underling, from the<br>third-class carriage, from the ordinary, non-political, non-moral,<br>passive man.<br><br>I have been using the phrase 'ordinary man' rather loosely, and I have<br>taken it for granted that the 'ordinary man' exists, a thing now denied<br>by some people. I do not mean that the people Miller is writing about<br>constitute a majority, still less that he is writing about proletarians.<br>No English or American novelist has as yet seriously attempted that. And<br>again, the people in TROPIC OF CANCER fall short of being ordinary to the<br>extent that they are idle, disreputable, and more or less 'artistic'. As<br>I have said already, this a pity, but it is the necessary result of<br>expatriation. Miller's 'ordinary man' is neither the manual worker nor<br>the suburban householder, but the derelict, the DÉCLASSÉ, the adventurer,<br>the American intellectual without roots and without money. Still, the<br>experiences even of this type overlap fairly widely with those of more<br>normal people. Milter has been able to get the most out of his rather<br>limited material because he has had the courage to identify with it. The<br>ordinary man, the 'average sensual man', has been given the power of<br>speech, like Balaam's ass.<br><br>It will be seen that this is something out of date, or at any rate out of<br>fashion. The average sensual man is out of fashion. Preoccupation with<br>sex and truthfulness about the inner life are out of fashion. American<br>Paris is out of fashion. A book like TROPIC OF CANCER, published at such<br>a time, must be either a tedious preciosity or something unusual, and I<br>think a majority of the people who have read it would agree that it is<br>not the first. It is worth trying to discover just what, this escape from<br>the current literary fashion means. But to do that one has got to see it<br>against its background--that is, against the general development of<br>English literature in the twenty years since the Great War.<br><br><br>II<br><br><br>When one says that a writer is fashionable one practically always means<br>that he is admired by people under thirty. At the beginning of the period<br>I am speaking of, the years during and immediately after the war, the<br>writer who had the deepest hold upon the thinking young was almost<br>certainly Housman. Among people who were adolescent in the years 1910-25,<br>Housman had an influence which was enormous and is now not at all easy<br>to understand. In 1920, when I was about seventeen, I probably knew the<br>whole of the SHROPSHIRE LAD by heart. I wonder how much impression the<br>SHROPSHIRE LAD makes at this moment on a boy of the same age and more or<br>less the same cast of mind? No doubt he has heard of it and even glanced<br>into it; it might strike him as cheaply clever--probably that would be<br>about all. Yet these are the poems that I and my contemporaries used to<br>recite to ourselves, over and over, in a kind of ecstasy, just as earlier<br>generations had recited Meredith's 'Love in a Valley', Swinburne's<br>'Garden of Proserpine' etc., etc.<br><br><br>With rue my heart is laden<br>For golden friends I had,<br>For many a roselipt maiden<br>And many a lightfoot lad.<br><br>By brooks too broad for leaping<br>The lightfoot boys are laid;<br>The roselipt girls arc sleeping<br>In fields Where roses fade.<br><br><br>It just tinkles. But it did not seem to tinkle in 1920. Why does the<br>bubble always burst? To answer that question one has to take account of<br>the EXTERNAL conditions that make certain writers popular at certain<br>times. Housman's poems had not attracted much notice when they were first<br>published. What was there in them that appealed so deeply to a single<br>generation, the generation born round about 1900?<br><br>In the first place, Housman is a 'country' poet. His poems are full of<br>the charm of buried villages, the nostalgia of place-names, Clunton and<br>Clunbury, Knighton, Ludlow, 'on Wenlock Edge', 'in summer time on<br>Bredon', thatched roofs and the jingle of smithies, the wild jonquils in<br>the pastures, the 'blue, remembered hills'. War poems apart, English<br>verse of the 1910-25 period is mostly 'country'. The reason no doubt was<br>that the RENTIER-professional class was ceasing once and for all to have<br>any real relationship with the soil; but at any rate there prevailed<br>then, far more than now, a kind of snobbism of belonging to the country<br>and despising the town. England at that time was hardly more an<br>agricultural country than it is now, but before the light industries<br>began to spread themselves it was easier to think of it as one. Most<br>middle-class boys grew up within sight of a farm, and naturally it was<br>the picturesque side of farm life that appealed to them--the ploughing,<br>harvesting, stack-thrashing and so forth. Unless he has to do it himself<br>a boy is not likely to notice the horrible drudgery of hoeing turnip,<br>milking cows with chapped teats at four o'clock in the morning, etc.,<br>etc. Just before, just after, and for that matter, during the war was the<br>great age of the 'Nature poet', the heyday of Richard Jefferies and W. H.<br>Hudson. Rupert Brooke's 'Grantchester', the star poem of 1913, is nothing<br>but an enormous gush of 'country' sentiment, a sort of accumulated vomit<br>from a stomach stuffed with place-names. Considered as a poem<br>'Grantchester' is something wors than worthless, but as an illustration<br>of what the thinking middle-class young of that period FELT it is a<br>valuable document.<br><br>Housman, however, did not enthuse over the rambler roses in the<br>week-ending spirit of Brooke and the others. The 'country' motif is there<br>all the time, but mainly as a background. Most of the poems have a<br>quasi-human subject, a kind of idealized rustic, in reality Strephon or<br>Corydon brought up to date. This in itself had a deep appeal. Experience<br>shows that overcivilized people enjoy reading about rustics (key-phrase,<br>'close to the soil') because they imagine them to be more primitive and<br>passionate than themselves. Hence the 'dark earth' novel of Sheila<br>Kaye-Smith, etc. And at that time a middle-class boy, with his 'country'<br>bias, would identify with an agricultural worker as he would never have<br>done with a town worker. Most boys had in their minds a vision of an<br>idealized ploughman, gipsy, poacher, or gamekeeper, always pictured as a<br>wild, free, roving blade, living a life of rabbit-snaring, cockfighting,<br>horses, beer, and women. Masefield's 'Everlasting Mercy', another<br>valuable period-piece, immensely popular with boys round about the war<br>years, gives you this vision in a very crude form. But Housman's Maurices<br>and Terences could be taken seriously where Mascfield's Saul Kane could<br>not; on this side of him, Housman was Masefield with a dash of<br>Theocritus. Moreover all his themes are adolescent--murder, suicide,<br>unhappy love, early death. They deal with the simple, intelligible<br>disasters that give you the feeling of being up against the 'bedrock<br>facts'of life:<br><br>The sun burns on the half-mown hill,<br>By now the blood has dried;<br>And Maurice among the hay lies still<br>And my knife is in his side.<br><br>And again:<br><br>They hand us now in Shrewsbury jail<br>And whistles blow forlorn,<br>And trains all night groan on the rail<br>To men who die at morn.<br><br>It is all more or less in the same tune. Everything comes unstuck. 'Ned<br>lies long in the churchyard and Tom lies long in jail'. And notice also<br>the exquisite self-pity--the 'nobody loves me' feeling:<br><br>The diamond drops adorning<br>The low mound on the lea,<br>These arc the tears of morning,<br>That weeps, but not for thee.<br><br>Hard cheese, old chap! Such poems might have been written expressly for<br>adolescents. And the unvarying sexual pessimism (the girl always dies or<br>marries somebody else) seemed like wisdom to boys who were herded<br>together in public schools and were half-inclined to think of women as<br>something unattainable. Whether Housman ever had the same appeal for<br>girls I doubt. In his poems the woman's point of view is not considered,<br>she is merely the nymph, the siren, the treacherous half-human creature<br>who leads you a little distance and then gives you the slip.<br><br>But Housman would not have appealed so deeply to the people who were<br>young in 1920 if it had not been for another strain in him, and that was<br>his blasphemous, antinomian, 'cynical' strain. The fight that always<br>occurs between the generations was exceptionally bitter at the end of the<br>Great War; this was partly due to the war itself, and partly it was an<br>indirect result of the Russian Revolution, but an intellectual struggle<br>was in any case due at about that date. Owing probably to the ease and<br>security of life in England, which even the war hardly disturbed, many<br>people whose ideas were formed in the eighties or earlier had carried<br>them quite unmodified into the nineteen-twenties. Meanwhile, so far as<br>the younger generation was concerned, the official beliefs were<br>dissolving like sand-castles. The slump in religious belief, for<br>instance, was spectacular. For several years the old-young antagonism<br>took on a quality of real hatred. What was left of the war generation had<br>crept out of the massacre to find their elders still bellowing the<br>slogans of 1914, and a slightly younger generation of boys were writhing<br>under dirty-minded celibate schoolmasters. It was to these that Housman<br>appealed, with his implied sexual revolt and his personal grievance<br>against God. He was patriotic, it was true, but in a harmless<br>old-fashioned way, to the tune of red coats and 'God save the Queen'<br>rather than steel helmets and 'Hang the Kaiser'. And he was satisfyingly<br>anti-Christian--he stood for a kind of bitter, defiant paganism, the<br>conviction that life is short and the gods are against you, which exactly<br>fitted the prevailing mood of the young; and all in charming fragile<br>verse that was composed almost entirely of words of one syllable.<br><br>It will be seen that I have discussed Housman as though he were merely a<br>propagandist, an utterer of maxims and quotable 'bits'. Obviously he was<br>more than that. There is no need to under-rate him now because he was<br>over-rated a few years ago. Although one gets into trouble nowadays for<br>saying so, there are a number of his poems ('Into my heart an air that<br>kills', for instance, and 'Is my team ploughing?') that are not likely to<br>remain long out of favour. But at bottom it is always a writer's<br>tendency, his 'purpose', his 'message', that makes him liked or disliked.<br>The proof of this is the extreme difficulty of seeing any literary merit<br>in a book that seriously damages your deepest beliefs. And no book is<br>ever truly neutral. Some or other tendency is always discernible, in<br>verse as much as in prose, even if it does no more than determine the<br>form and the choice of imagery. But poets who attain wide popularity, Uke<br>Housman, are as a rule definitely gnomic writers.<br><br>After the war, after Housman and the Nature poets, there appears a group<br>of writers of completely different tendency--Joyce, Eliot, Pound,<br>Lawrence, Wyndham, Lewis, Aldous Huxley, Lytton Strachey. So far as the<br>middle and late twenties go, these are 'the movement', as surely as the<br>Auden-Spender group have been 'the movement' during the past few years.<br>It is true that not all of the gifted writers of the period can be fitted<br>into the pattern. E. M. Forster, for instance, though he wrote his best<br>book in 1923 or thereabouts, was essentially, pre-war, and Yeats does not<br>seem in either of his phases to belong to the twenties. Others who were<br>still living, Moore, Conrad, Bennett, Wells, Norman Douglas, had shot<br>their bolt before the war ever happened. On the other hand, a writer who<br>should be added to the group, though in the narrowly literary sense he<br>hardly 'belongs', is Somerset Maughami. Of course the dates do not fit<br>exactly; most of these writers had already published books before the<br>war, but they can be classified as post-war in the same sense that the<br>younger men now writing are post-slump. Equally, of course, you could<br>read through most of the literary papers of the time without grasping<br>that these people are 'the movement'. Even more then than at most times<br>the big shots of literary journalism were busy pretending that the<br>age-before-last had not come to an end. Squire ruled the LONDON MERCURY<br>Gibbs and Walpole were the gods of the lending libraries, there was a<br>cult of cheeriness and manliness, beer and cricket, briar pipes and<br>monogamy, and it was at all times possible to earn a few guineas by<br>writing an article denouncing 'high-brows'. But all the same it was the<br>despised highbrows who had captured the young. The wind was blowing from<br>Europe, and long before 1930 it had blowu the beer-and-cricket school<br>naked, except for their knight-hoods.<br><br>But the first thing one would notice about the group of writers I have<br>named above is that they do not look like a group. Moreover several of<br>them would strongly object to being coupled with several of the others.<br>Lawrence and Eliot were in reality antipathetic, Huxley worshipped<br>Lawrence but was repelled by Joyce, most of the others would have looked<br>down on Huxley, Strachey, and Maugham, and Lewis attacked everyone in<br>turn; indeed, his reputation as a writer rests largely on these attacks.<br>And yet there is a certain temperamental similarity, evident enough now,<br>though it would not have been so a dozen years ago. What it amounts to is<br>PESSIMISM OF OUTLOOK. But it is necessary to make clear what is meant by<br>pessimism.<br><br>If the keynote of the Georgian poets was 'beauty of Nature', the keynote<br>of the post-war writers would be 'tragic sense of life'. The spirit<br>behind Housman's poems for instance, is not tragic, merely querulous; it<br>is hedonism disappointed. The same is true of Hardy, though one ought to<br>make an exception of THE DYNASTS. But the Joyce-Eliot group come later in<br>time, puritanism is not their main adversary, they are able from the<br>start to 'see through' most of the things that their predecessors had<br>fought for. All of them are temperamentally hostile to the notion of<br>'progress'; it is felt that progress not only doesn't happen, but OUGHT<br>not to happen. Given this general similarity, there are, of course,<br>differences of approach between the writers I have named as well as<br>different degrees of talent. Eliot's pessimism is partly the Christian<br>pessimism, which implies a certain indifference to human misery, partly a<br>lament over the decadence of Western civilization ('We are the hollow<br>men, we are the stuffed men', etc., etc.), a sort of twilight-of-the-gods<br>feeling, which finally leads him, in Sweeney Agonistes for instance, to<br>achieve the difficult feat of making modern life out to be worse than it<br>is. With Strachey it is merely a polite eighteenth-century scepticism<br>mixed up with a taste for debunking. With Maugham it is a kind of stoical<br>resignation, the stiff upper lip of the pukka sahib somewhere east of<br>Suez, carrying on with his job without believing in it, like an Antonine<br>Emperor. Lawrence at first sight does not seem to be a pessimistic<br>writer, because, like Dickens, he is a 'change-of-heart' man and<br>constantly insisting that life here and now would be all right if only<br>you looked at it a little differently. But what he is demanding is a<br>movement away from our mechanized civilization, which is not going to<br>happen. Therefore his exasperation with the present turns once more into<br>idealization of the past, this time a safely mythical past, the Bronze<br>Age. When bawrence prefers the Etruscans (his Etruscans) to ourselves it<br>is difficult not to agree with him, and yet, after all, it is a species<br>of defeatism, because that is not the direction in which the world is<br>moving. The kind of life that he is always pointing to, a life centring<br>round the simple mysteries--sex, earth, fire, water, blood--is merely a<br>lost cause. All he has been able to produce, therefore, is a wish that<br>things would happen in a way in which they are manifestly not going to<br>happen. 'A wave of generosity or a wave of death', he says, but it is<br>obvious that there are no waves of generosity this side of the horizon.<br>So he flees to Mexico, and then dies at forty-five, a few years before<br>the wave of death gets going. It will be seen that once again I am<br>speaking of these people as though they were not artists, as though they<br>were merely propagandists putting a 'message' across. And once again it<br>is obvious that all of them are more than that. It would be absurd, for<br>instance, to look on ULYSSES as MERELY a show-up of the horror of modern<br>life, the 'dirty DAILY MAIL era', as Pound put it. Joyce actually is more<br>of a 'pure artist' than most writers. But ULYSSES could not have been<br>written by someone who was merely dabbling with word-patterns; it is the<br>product of a special vision of life, the vision of a Catholic who has<br>lost his faith. What Joyce is saying is 'Here is life without God. Just<br>look at it!' and his technical innovations, important though they are,<br>are primarily to serve this purpose.<br><br>But what is noticeable about all these writers is that what 'purpose'<br>they have is very much up in the air. There is no attention to the urgent<br>problems of the moment, above all no politics in the narrower sense. Our<br>eyes are directed to Rome, to Byzantium, to Montparnasse, to Mexico, to<br>the Etruscans, to the Subconscious, to the solar plexus--to everywhere<br>except the places where things are actually happening. When one looks<br>back at the twenties, nothing is queerer than the way in which every<br>important event in Europe escaped the notice of the English<br>intelligentsia. The Russian Revolution, for instance, all but vanishes<br>from the English consciousness between the death of Lenin and the Ukraine<br>famine--about ten years. Throughout those years Russia means Tolstoy,<br>Dostoievsky, and exiled counts driving taxi-cabs. Italy means<br>picture-galleries, ruins, churches, and museums--but not Black-shirts.<br>Germany means films, nudism, and psychoanalysis--but not Hitler, of whom<br>hardly anyone had heard till 1931. In 'cultured' circles<br>art-for-art's-saking extended practically to a worship of the<br>meaningless. Literature was supposed to consist solely in the<br>manipulation of words. To judge a book by its subject matter was the<br>unforgivable sin, and even to be aware of its subject matter was looked<br>on as a lapse of a taste. About 1928, in one of the three genuinely funny<br>jokes that PUNCH has produced since the Great War, an intolerable youth<br>is pictured informing his aunt that he intends to 'write'. 'And what are<br>you going to write about, dear?' asks the aunt. 'My dear aunt,' says the<br>youth crushingly, 'one doesn't write ABOUT anything, one just WRITES.'<br>The best writers of the twenties did not subscribe to this doctrine,<br>their 'purpose' is in most cases fairly overt, but it is usually<br>'purpose' along moral-religious-cultural lines. Also, when translatable<br>into political terms, it is in no case 'left'. In one way or another the<br>tendency of all the writers in this group is conservative. Lewis, for<br>instance, spent years in frenzied witch-smellings after 'Bolshevism',<br>which he was able to detect in very unlikely places. Recently he has<br>changed some of his views, perhaps influenced by Hitler's treatment of<br>artists, but it is safe to bet that he will not go very far leftward.<br>Pound seems to have plumped definitely for Fascism, at any rate the<br>Italian variety. Eliot has remained aloof, but if forced at the pistol's<br>point to choose between Fascism and some more democratic form of<br>socialism, would probably choose Fascism. Huxley starts off with the<br>usual despair-of-life, then, under the influence of Lawrence's 'dark<br>abdomen', tries something called Life-Worship, and finally arrives at<br>pacifism--atenable position, and at this moment an honourable one, but<br>probably in the long run involving rejection of socialism. It is also<br>noticeable that most of the writers in this group have a certain<br>tenderness for the Catholic Church, though not usually of a kind that an<br>orthodox Catholic would accept.<br><br>The mental connexion between pessimism and a reactionary outlook is no<br>doubt obvious enough. What is perhaps less obvious is just WHY the<br>leading writers of the twenties were predominantly pessimistic. Why<br>always the sense of decadence, the skulls and cactuses, the yearning<br>after lost faith and impossible civilizations? Was it not, after all,<br>BECAUSE these people were writing in an exceptionally comfortable epoch?<br>It is just in such times that 'cosmic despair' can flourish. People with<br>empty bellies never despair of the universe, nor even think about the<br>universe, for that matter. The whole period 1910-30 was a prosperous one,<br>and even the war years were physically tolerable if one happened to be a<br>non-combatant in one of the Allied countries. As for the twenties, they<br>were the golden age of the RENTIER-intellectual, a period of<br>irresponsibility such as the world had never before seen. The war was<br>over, the new totalitarian states had not arisen, moral and religious<br>tabus of all descriptions had vanished, and the cash was rolling in.<br>'Disillusionment' was all the fashion. Everyone with a safe £500 a year<br>turned highbrow and began training himself in TAEDIUM VITAE. It was an<br>age of eagles and of crumpets, facile despairs, backyard Hamlets, cheap<br>return tickets to the end of the night. In some of the minor<br>characteristic novels of the period, books like TOLD BY AN IDIOT, the<br>despair-of-life reaches a Turkish-bath atmosphere of self-pity. And even<br>the best writers of the time can be convicted of a too Olympian attitude,<br>a too great readiness to wash their hands of the immediate practical<br>problem. They see life very comprehensively, much more so than those who<br>come immediately before or after them, but they see it through the wrong<br>end of the telescope. Not that that invalidates their books, as books.<br>The first test of any work of art is survival, and it is a fact that a<br>great deal that was written in the period 1910-30 has survived and looks<br>like continuing to survive. One has only to think of ULYSSES, OF HUMAN<br>BONDAGE, most of Lawrence's early work, especially his short stories, and<br>virtually the whole of Eliot's poems up to about 1930, to wonder what is<br>now being written that will wear so well.<br><br>But quite Suddenly, in the years 1930-5, something happens. The literary<br>climate changes. A new group of writers, Auden and Spender and the rest<br>of them, has made its appearance, and although technically these writers<br>owe something to their predecessors, their 'tendency' is entirely<br>different. Suddenly we have got out of the twilight of the gods into a<br>sort of Boy Scout atmosphere of bare knees and community singing. The<br>typical literary man ceases to be a cultured expatriate with a leaning<br>towards the Church, and becomes an eager-minded schoolboy with a leaning<br>towards Communism. If the keynote of the writers of the twenties is<br>'tragic sense of life', the keynote of the new writers is 'serious<br>purpose'.<br><br>The differences between the two schools are discussed at some length in<br>Mr Louis MacNeice's book MODERN POETRY. This book is, of course, written<br>entirely from the angle of the younger group and takes the superiority of<br>their standards for granted. According to Mr MacNeice:<br><br><br>The poets of NEW SIGNATURES, [Note: Published in 1932.(Author's footnote)]<br>unlike Yeats and Eliot, are emotionally partisan. Yeats proposed to turn<br>his back on desire and hatred; Eliot sat back and watched other people's<br>emotions with ennui and an ironical self-pity. . . . The whole poetry, on<br>the other hand, of Auden, Spender, and Day Lewis implies that they have<br>desires and hatreds of their own and, further, that they think some things<br>ought to be desired and others hated.<br><br><br>And again:<br><br><br>The poets of NEW SIGNATURES have swung back. . . to the Greek preference<br>for information or statement. Then first requirement is to have something<br>to say, and after that you must say it as well as you can.<br><br><br>In other words, 'purpose' has come back, the younger writers have 'gone<br>into politics'. As I have pointed out already, Eliot & Co. are not really<br>so non-partisan as Mr MacNeice seems to suggest. Still, it is broadly<br>true that in the twenties the literary emphasis was more on technique and<br>less on subject matter than it is now.<br><br>The leading figures in this group are Auden, Spender, Day Lewis,<br>MacNeice, and there is a long string of writers of more or less the same<br>tendency, Isherwood, John Lehmann, Arthur Calder-Marshall, Edward Upward,<br>Alee Brown, Philip Henderson, and many others. As before, I am lumping<br>them together simply according to tendency. Obviously there are very<br>great variations in talent. But when one compares these writers with the<br>Joyce-Eliot generation, the immediately striking thing is how much easier<br>it is to form them into a group. Technically they are closer together,<br>politically they are almost indistinguishable, and their criticisms of<br>one another's work have always been (to put it mildly) good-natured. The<br>outstanding writers of the twenties were of very varied origins, few of<br>them had passed through the ordinary English educational mill<br>(incidentally, the best of them, barring Lawrence, were not Englishmen),<br>and most of them had had at some time to struggle against poverty,<br>neglect, and even downright persecution. On the other hand, nearly all<br>the younger writers fit easily into the public-school-university-Bloomsbury<br>pattern. The few who are of proletarian origin are of the kind that is<br>declassed early in life, first by means of scholarships and then by the<br>bleaching-tub of London 'culture'. It is significant that several of the<br>writers in this group have been not only boys but, subsequently, masters<br>at public schools. Some years ago I described Auden as 'a sort of<br>gutless Kipling'. As criticism this was quite unworthy, indeed it was<br>merely a spiteful remark, but it is a fact that in Auden's work,<br>especially his earlier work, an atmosphere of uplift--something rather<br>like Kipling's If or Newbolt's Play up, Play up, and Play the Game!--never<br>seems to be very far away. Take, for instance, a poem like 'You're<br>leaving now, and it's up to you boys'. It is pure scoutmaster, the exact<br>note of the ten-minutes' straight talk on the dangers of self-abuse.<br>No doubt there is an element of parody that he intends, but there is also<br>a deeper resemblance that he does not intend. And of course the rather<br>priggish note that is common to most of these writers is a symptom,<br>of release. By throwing 'pure art' overboard they have freed themselves<br>from the fear of being laughed at and vastly enlarged their scope.<br>The prophetic side of Marxism, for example, is new material for poetry<br>and has great possibilities.<br><br><br>We are nothing<br>We have fallen<br>Into the dark and shall be destroyed.<br>Think though, that in this darkness<br>We hold the secret hub of an idea<br>Whose living sunlit wheel revolves in future years outside.<br><br>(Spender, TRIAL OF A JUDGE)<br><br><br>But at the same time, by being Marxized literature has moved no nearer to<br>the masses. Even allowing for the time-lag, Auden and Spender are<br>somewhat farther from being popular writers than Joyce and Eliot, let<br>alone Lawrence. As before, there are many contemporary writers who are<br>outside the current, but there is not much doubt about what is the<br>current. For the middle and late thirties, Auden Spender & Co. ARE 'the<br>movement', just as Joyce, Eliot & Co. were for the twenties. And the<br>movement is in the direction of some rather ill-defined thing called<br>Communism. As early as 1934 or 1935 it was considered eccentric in<br>literary circles not to be more or less 'left', and in another year or<br>two there had grown up a left-wing orthodoxy that made a certain set of<br>opinions absolutely DE RIGUEUR on certain subjects, The idea had begun to<br>gain ground (VIDE Edward Upward and others) that a writer must either be<br>actively 'left' or write badly. Between 1935 and 1939 the Communist<br>Party had an almost irresistible fascination for any writer under<br>forty. It became as normal to hear that so-and-so had 'joined' as<br>it had been a few years earlier, when Roman Catholicism was fashionable,<br>to hear that So-and-so had 'been received'. For about three years, in<br>fact, the central stream of English literature was more or less directly<br>under Communist control. How was it possible for such a thing to happen?<br>And at the same time, what is meant by 'Communism'? It is better to<br>answer the second question first.<br><br>The Communist movement in Western Europe began, as a movement for the<br>violent overthrow of capitalism, and degenerated within a few years into<br>an instrument of Russian foreign policy. This was probably inevitable<br>when this revolutionary ferment that followed the Great War had died<br>down. So far as I know, the only comprehensive history of this subject in<br>English is Franz Borfcenau's book, THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL. What<br>Borkcnau's facts even more than his deductions make clear is that<br>Communism could never have developed along its present lines if any<br>revolutionary feeling had existed in the industrialized countries. In<br>England, for instance, it is obvious that no such feeling has existed for<br>years past. The pathetic membership figures of all extremist parties show<br>this clearly. It is, only natural, therefore, that the English Communist<br>movement should be controlled by people who are mentally sub-servient to<br>Russia and have no real aim except to manipulate British foreign policy<br>in the Russian interest. Of course such an aim cannot be openly admitted,<br>and it is this fact that gives the Communist Party its very peculiar<br>character. The more vocal kind of Communist is in effect a Russian<br>publicity agent posing as an international socialist. It is a pose that<br>is easily kept up at normal times, but becomes difficult in moments of<br>crisis, because of the fact that the U.S.S.R. is no more scrupulous in<br>its foreign policy than the rest of the Great Powers. Alliances, changes<br>of front etc., which only make sense as part of the game of power<br>politics have to be explained and justified in terms of international<br>socialism. Every time Stalin swaps partners, 'Marxism' has to be hammered<br>into a new shape. This entails sudden and violent changes of 'line',<br>purges, denunciations, systematic destruction of party literature, etc.,<br>etc. Every Communist is in fact liable at any moment to have to alter his<br>most fundamental convictions, or leave the party. The unquestionable<br>dogma of Monday may become the damnable heresy of Tuesday, and so on.<br>This has happened at least three times during the past ten years. It<br>follows that in any Western country a Communist Party is always unstable<br>and usually very small. Its long-term membership really consists of an<br>inner ring of intellectuals who have identified with the Russian<br>bureaucracy, and a slightly larger body of working-class people who feel<br>a loyalty towards Soviet Russia without necessarily understanding its<br>policies. Otherwise there is only a shifting membership, one lot coming<br>and another going with each change of 'line'.<br><br>In 1930 the English Communist Party was a tiny, barely legal organization<br>whose main activity was libelling the Labour Party. But by 1935 the face<br>of Europe had changed, and left-wing politics changed with it. Hitler had<br>risen to power and begun to rearm, the Russian five-year plans had<br>succeeded, Russia had reappeared as a great military power. As Hitler's<br>three targets of attack were, to all appearances, Great Britain, France,<br>and the U.S.S.R., the three countries were forced into a sort of uneasy<br>RAPPROCHEMENT. This meant that the English or French Communist was<br>obliged to become a good patriot and imperialist--that is, to defend the<br>very things he had been attacking for the past fifteen years. The<br>Comintern slogans suddenly faded from red to pink. 'World revolution' and<br>'Social-Fascism' gave way to 'Defence of democracy' and 'Stop Hitler'.<br>The years 1935-9 were the period of anti-Fascism and the Popular Front,<br>the heyday of the Left Book Club, when red Duchesses and 'broadminded'<br>deans toured the battlefields of the Spanish war and Winston Churchill<br>was the blue-eyed boy of the DAILY WORKER. Since then, of course, there<br>has been yet another change of 'line'. But what is important for my<br>purpose is that it was during the 'anti-Fascist' phase that the younger<br>English writers gravitated towards Communism.<br><br>The Fascism-democracy dogfight was no doubt an attraction in itself, but<br>in any case their conversion was due at about that date. It was obvious<br>that LAISSEZ-FAIRE capitalism was finished and that there had got to be<br>some kind of reconstruction; in the world of 1935 it was hardly possible<br>to remain politically indifferent. But why did these young men turn<br>towards anything so alien as Russian Communism? Why should WRITERS be<br>attracted by a form of socialism that makes mental honesty impossible?<br>The explanation really lies in something that had already made itself<br>felt before the slump and before Hitler: middle-class unemployment.<br><br>Unemployment is not merely a matter of not having a job. Most people can<br>get a job of sorts, even at the worst of times. The trouble was that by<br>about 1930 there was no activity, except perhaps scientific research, the<br>arts, and left-wing politics, that a thinking person could believe in.<br>The debunking of Western civilization had reached its Climax and<br>'disillusionment' was immensely widespread. Who now could take it for<br>granted to go through life in the ordinary middle-class way, as a<br>soldier, a clergyman, a stockbroker, an Indian Civil Servant, or<br>what-not? And how many of the values by which our grandfathers lived<br>could not be taken seriously? Patriotism, religion, the Empire, the<br>family, the sanctity of marriage, the Old School Tie, birth, breeding,<br>honour, discipline--anyone of ordinary education could turn the whole<br>lot of them inside out in three minutes. But what do you achieve, after<br>all, by getting rid of such primal things as patriotism and religion? You<br>have not necessarily got rid of the need for SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN.<br>There had been a sort of false dawn a few years earlier when numbers of<br>young intellectuals, including several quite gifted writers (Evelyn<br>Waugh, Christopher Hollis, and others), had fled into the Catholic<br>Church. It is significant that these people went almost invariably to the<br>Roman Church and not, for instance, to the C. of E., the Greek Church, or<br>the Protestants sects. They went, that is, to the Church with a<br>world-wide organization, the one with a rigid discipline, the one with<br>power and prestige behind it. Perhaps it is even worth noticing that the<br>only latter-day convert of really first-rate gifts, Eliot, has embraced<br>not Romanism but Anglo-Catholicism, the ecclesiastical equivalent of<br>Trotskyism. But I do not think one need look farther than this for the<br>reason why the young writers of the thirties flocked into or towards the<br>Communist Party. If was simply something to believe in. Here was a<br>Church, an army, an orthodoxy, a discipline. Here was a Fatherland and--<br>at any rate since 1935 or thereabouts--a Fuehrer. All the loyalties and<br>superstitions that the intellect had seemingly banished could come<br>rushing back under the thinnest of disguises. Patriotism, religion,<br>empire, military glory--all in one word, Russia. Father, king, leader,<br>hero, saviour--all in one word, Stalin. God--Stalin. The devil--<br>Hitler. Heaven--Moscow. Hell--Berlin. All the gaps were filled up. So,<br>after all, the 'Communism' of the Ebglish intellectual is something<br>explicable enough. It is the patriotism of the deracinated<br><br>But there is one other thing that undoubtedly contributed to the cult of<br>Russia among the English intelligentsia during these years, and that is<br>the softness and security of life in England itself. With all its<br>injustices, England is still the land of habeas corpus, and the<br>over-whelming majority of English people have no experience of violence<br>or illegality. If you have grown up in that sort of atmosphere it is not<br>at all easy to imagine what a despotic régime is like. Nearly all the<br>dominant writers of the thirties belonged to the soft-boiled emancipated<br>middle class and were too young to have effective memories of the Great<br>War. To people of that kind such things as purges, secret police, summary<br>executions, imprisonment without trial etc., etc., are too remote to be<br>terrifying. They can swallow totalitarianism BECAUSE they have no<br>experience of anything except liberalism. Look, for instance, at this<br>extract from Mr Auden's poem 'Spain' (incidentally this poem is one of<br>the few decent things that have been written about the Spanish war):<br><br><br>To-morrow for the young, the poets exploding like bombs,<br>The walks by the lake, the weeks of perfect communion;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow the bicycle races<br>Through the suburbs on summer evenings. But to-day the struggle.<br><br>To-day the deliberate increase in the chances of death,<br>The conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day the expending of powers<br>On the flat ephemeral pamphlet and the boring meeting.<br><br><br>The second stanza is intended as a sort of thumb-nail sketch of a day in<br>the life of a 'good party man'. In the-morning a couple of political<br>murders, a ten-minutes' interlude to stifle 'bourgeois' remorse, and then<br>a hurried luncheon and a busy afternoon and evening chalking walls and<br>distributing leaflets. All very edifying. But notice the phrase<br>'necessary murder'. It could only be written by a person to whom murder<br>is at most a WORD. Personally I would not speak so lightly of murder. It<br>so happens that I have seen the bodies of numbers of murdered men--I<br>don't mean killed in battle, I mean murdered. Therefore I have some<br>conception of what murder means--the terror, the hatred, the howling<br>relatives, the post-mortems, the blood, the smells. To me, murder is<br>something to be avoided. So it is to any ordinary person. The Hitlers and<br>Stalins find murder necessary, but they don't advertise their<br>callousness, and they don't speak of it as murder; it is 'liquidation',<br>'elimination', or some other soothing phrase. Mr Auden's brand of<br>amoralism is only possible, if you are the kind of person who is always<br>somewhere else when the trigger is pulled. So much of left-wing thought<br>is a kind of playing with fire by people who don't even know that fire is<br>hot. The warmongering to which the English intelligentsia gave themselves<br>up in the period 1935-9 was largely based on a sense of personal<br>immunity. The attitude was very different in France, where the military<br>service is hard to dodge and even literary men know the weight of a pack.<br><br>Towards the end of Mr Cyril Connolly's recent book, ENEMIES OF PROMISE,<br>there occurs an interesting and revealing passage. The first part of the<br>book, is, more or less, an evaluation of present-day literature. Mr<br>Connolly belongs exactly to the generation of the writers of 'the<br>movement', and with not many reservations their values are his values. It<br>is interesting to notice that among prose-writers her admires chiefly<br>those specialising in violence--the would-be tough American school,<br>Hemingway, etc. The latter part of the book, however, is autobiographical<br>and consists of an account, fascinatingly accurate, of life at a<br>preparatory school and Eton in the years 1910-20. Mr Connolly ends by<br>remarking:<br><br><br>Were I to deduce anything from my feelings on leaving Eton, it might be<br>called THE THEORY OF PERMANENT ADOLESCENCE. It is the theory that the<br>experiences undergone by boys at the great public schools are so intense<br>as to dominate their lives and to arrest their development.<br><br><br>When you read the second sentence in this passage, your natural impulse<br>is to look for the misprint. Presumably there is a 'not' left out, or<br>something. But no, not a bit of it! He means it! And what is more, he is<br>merely s<br><br></font></p>
