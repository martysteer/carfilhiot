<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">In many languages, it is said, there is no nonsense poetry, and there is<br>not a great deal of it even in English. The bulk of it is in nursery<br>rhymes and scraps of folk poetry, some of which may not have been<br>strictly nonsensical at the start, but have become so because their<br>original application has been forgotten. For example, the rhyme about<br>Margery Daw:<br><br><br>See-saw, Margery Daw,<br>Dobbin shall have a new master.<br>He shall have but a penny a day<br>Because he can't go any faster.<br><br><br>Or the other version that I learned in Oxfordshire as a little boy:<br><br><br>See-saw, Margery Daw,<br>Sold her bed and lay upon straw.<br>Wasn't she a silly slut<br>To sell her bed and lie upon dirt?<br><br><br>It may be that there was once a real person called Margery Daw, and<br>perhaps there was even a Dobbin who somehow came into the story. When<br>Shakespeare makes Edgar in KING LEAR quote "Pillicock sat on Pillicock<br>hill", and similar fragments, he is uttering nonsense, but no doubt these<br>fragments come from forgotten ballads in which they once had a meaning.<br>The typical scrap of folk poetry which one quotes almost unconsciously is<br>not exactly nonsense but a sort of musical comment on some recurring<br>event, such as "One a penny, two a penny, Hot-Cross buns", or "Polly, put<br>the kettle on, we'll all have tea". Some of these seemingly frivolous<br>rhymes actually express a deeply pessimistic view of life, the churchyard<br>wisdom of the peasant. For instance:<br><br><br>Solomon Grundy,<br>Born on Monday,<br>Christened on Tuesday,<br>Married on Wednesday,<br>Took ill on Thursday,<br>Worse on Friday,<br>Died on Saturday,<br>Buried on Sunday,<br>And that was the end of Solomon Grundy.<br><br>which is a gloomy story, but remarkably similar to yours or mine.<br><br>Until Surrealism made a deliberate raid on the unconscious, poetry that<br>aimed at being nonsense, apart from the meaningless refrains of songs,<br>does not seem to have been common. This gives a special position to<br>Edward Lear, whose nonsense rhymes have just been edited by Mr R.L.<br>Megroz, who was also responsible for the Penguin edition a year<br>or two before the war. Lear was one of the first writers to deal<br>in pure fantasy, with imaginary countries and made-up words, without<br>any satirical purpose. His poems are not all of them equally<br>nonsensical; some of them get their effect by a perversion<br>of logic, but they are all alike in that their underlying feeling is sad<br>and not bitter. They express a kind of amiable lunacy, a natural sympathy<br>with whatever is weak and absurd. Lear could fairly be called the<br>originator of the limerick, though verses in almost the same metrical<br>form are to be found in earlier writers, and what is sometimes considered<br>a weakness in his limericks--that is, the fact that the rhyme is the same<br>in the first and last lines--is part of their charm. The very slight<br>change increases the impression of ineffectuality, which might be spoiled<br>if there were some striking surprise. For example:<br><br><br>There was a young lady of Portugal<br>Whose ideas were excessively nautical;<br>She climbed up a tree<br>To examine the sea,<br>But declared she would never leave Portugal.<br><br><br>It is significant that almost no limericks since Lear's have been both<br>printable and funny enough to seem worth quoting. But he is really seen<br>at his best in certain longer poems, such as "The Owl and the Pussy-Cat"<br>or "The Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò":<br><br>On the Coast of Coromandel,<br>Where the early pumpkins blow,<br>In the middle of the woods<br>Lived the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.<br>Two old chairs, and half a candle<br>One old jug without a handle<br>These were all his worldly goods:<br>In the middle of the woods,<br>These were all the worldly goods<br>Of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò,<br>Of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.<br><br>Later there appears a lady with some white Dorking hens, and an<br>inconclusive love affair follows. Mr Megroz thinks, plausibly enough,<br>that this may refer to some incident in Lear's own life. He never<br>married, and it is easy to guess that there was something seriously wrong<br>in his sex life. A psychiatrist could no doubt find all kinds of<br>significance in his drawings and in the recurrence of certain made-up<br>words such as "runcible". His health was bad, and as he was the youngest<br>of twenty-one children in a poor family, he must have known anxiety and<br>hardship in very early life. It is clear that he was unhappy and by<br>nature solitary, in spite of having good friends.<br><br>Aldous Huxley, in praising Lear's fantasies as a sort of assertion of<br>freedom, has pointed out that the "They" of the limericks represent<br>common sense, legality and the duller virtues generally. "They" are the<br>realists, the practical men, the sober citizens in bowler hats who are<br>always anxious to stop you doing anything worth doing. For instance:<br><br>There was an Old Man of Whitehaven,<br>Who danced a quadrille with a raven;<br>But they said, "It's absurd<br>To encourage this bird!"<br>So they smashed that Old Man of Whitehaven.<br><br>To smash somebody just for dancing a quadrille with a raven is exactly<br>the kind of thing that "They" would do. Herbert Read has also praised<br>Lear, and is inclined to prefer his verse to that of Lewis Carroll, as<br>being purer fantasy. For myself, I must say that I find Lear funniest<br>when he is least arbitrary and when a touch of burlesque or perverted<br>logic makes its appearance. When he gives his fancy free play, as in his<br>imaginary names, or in things like "Three Receipts for Domestic Cookery",<br>he can be silly and tiresome. "The Pobble Who Has No Toes" is haunted by<br>the ghost of logic, and I think it is the element of sense in it that<br>makes it funny. The Pobble, it may be remembered, went fishing in the<br>Bristol Channel:<br><br>And all the Sailors and Admirals cried,<br>When they saw him nearing the further side--<br>"He has gone to fish, for his Aunt Jobiska's<br>Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!"<br><br>The thing that is funny here is the burlesque touch, the Admirals. What<br>is arbitrary--the word "runcible", and the cat's crimson whiskers--is<br>merely rather embarrassing. While the Pobble was in the water some<br>unidentified creatures came and ate his toes off, and when he got home<br>his aunt remarked:<br><br>"It's a fact the whole world knows,<br>That Pobbles are happier without their toes,"<br><br>which once again is funny because it has a meaning, and one might even<br>say a political significance. For the whole theory of authoritarian<br>governments is summed up in the statement that Pobbles were happier<br>without their toes. So also with the well-known limerick:<br><br>There was an Old Person of Basing,<br>Whose presence of mind was amazing;<br>He purchased a steed,<br>Which he rode at full speed,<br>And escaped from the people of Basing.<br><br>It is not quite arbitrary. The funniness is in the gentle implied<br>criticism of the people of Basing, who once again are "They", the<br>respectable ones, the right-thinking, art-hating majority.<br><br>The writer closest to Lear among his contemporaries was Lewis Carroll,<br>who, however, was less essentially fantastic--and, in my opinion, funnier.<br>Since then, as Mr Megroz points out in his Introduction, Lear's influence<br>has been considerable, but it is hard to believe that it has been<br>altogether good. The silly whimsiness of present-day children's books<br>could perhaps be partly traced back to him. At any rate, the idea of<br>deliberately setting out to write nonsense, though it came off in Lear's<br>case, is a doubtful one. Probably the best nonsense poetry is produced<br>gradually and accidentally, by communities rather than by individuals. As<br>a comic draughtsman, on the other hand, Lear's influence must have been<br>beneficial. James Thurber, for instance, must surely owe something to<br>Lear, directly or indirectly.<br><br></font></p>
