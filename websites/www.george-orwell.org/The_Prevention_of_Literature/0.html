<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">About a year ago I attended a meeting of the P.E.N. Club, the occasion<br>being the tercentenary of Milton's AEROPAGITICA--A pamphlet, it may be<br>remembered, in defense of freedom of the press. Milton's famous phrase<br>about the sin of "killing" a book was printed on the leaflets advertising<br>the meeting which had been circulated beforehand.<br><br>There were four speakers on the platform. One of them delivered a speech<br>which did deal with the freedom of the press, but only in relation to<br>India; another said, hesitantly, and in very general terms, that liberty<br>was a good thing; a third delivered an attack on the laws relating to<br>obscenity in literature. The fourth devoted most of his speech to a<br>defense of the Russian purges. Of the speeches from the body of the hall,<br>some reverted to the question of obscenity and the laws that deal with<br>it, others were simply eulogies of Soviet Russia. Moral liberty--the<br>liberty to discuss sex questions frankly in print--seemed to be<br>generally approved, but political liberty was not mentioned. Out of this<br>concourse of several hundred people, perhaps half of whom were directly<br>connected with the writing trade, there was not a single one who could<br>point out that freedom of the press, if it means anything at all, means<br>the freedom to criticize and oppose. Significantly, no speaker quoted<br>from the pamphlet which was ostensibly being commemorated. Nor was there<br>any mention of the various books which have been "killed" in England and<br>the United States during the war. In its net effect the meeting was a<br>demonstration in favor of censorship. [Note: It is fair to say that the<br>P.E.N. club celebrations, which lasted a week or more, did not always<br>stick at quite the same level. I happened to strike a bad day. But an<br>examination of the speeches (printed under the title FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION)<br>shows that almost nobody in our own day is able to speak out as roundly in<br>favour of intellectual liberty as Milton could do 300 years ago--and this<br>in spite of the fact Milton was writing in a period of civil war.<br>(Author's footnote)]<br><br>There was nothing particularly surprising in this. In our age, the idea<br>of intellectual liberty is under attack from two directions. On the one<br>side are its theoretical enemies, the apologists of totalitarianism, and<br>on the other its immediate, practical enemies, monopoly and bureaucracy.<br>Any writer or journalist who wants to retain his integrity finds himself<br>thwarted by the general drift of society rather than by active<br>persecution. The sort of things that are working against him are the<br>concentration of the press in the hands of a few rich men, the grip of<br>monopoly on radio and the films, the unwillingness of the public to spend<br>money on books, making it necessary for nearly every writer to earn part<br>of his living by hackwork, the encroachment of official bodies like the<br>M.O.I. [Ministry of Information] and the British Council, which help the<br>writer to keep alive but also waste his time and dictate his opinions, and<br>the continuous war atmosphere of the past ten years, whose distorting<br>effects no one has been able to escape. Everything in our age conspires to<br>turn the writer, and every other kind of artist as well, into a minor<br>official, working on themes handed down from above and never telling what<br>seems to him the whole of the truth. But in struggling against this fate<br>he gets no help from his own side; that is, there is no large body of<br>opinion which will assure him that he's in the right. In the past, at any<br>rate throughout the Protestant centuries, the idea of rebellion and the<br>idea of intellectual integrity were mixed up. A heretic--political, moral,<br>religious, or aesthetic--was one who refused to outrage his own<br>conscience. His outlook was summed up in the words of the Revivalist hymn:<br><br>Dare to be a Daniel<br>Dare to stand alone<br>Dare to have a purpose firm<br>Dare to make it known<br><br><br>To bring this hymn up to date one would have to add a "Don't" at the<br>beginning of each line. For it is the peculiarity of our age that the<br>rebels against the existing order, at any rate the most numerous and<br>characteristic of them, are also rebelling against the idea of individual<br>integrity. "Daring to stand alone" is ideologically criminal as well as<br>practically dangerous. The independence of the writer and the artist is<br>eaten away by vague economic forces, and at the same time it is<br>undermined by those who should be its defenders. It is with the second<br>process that I am concerned here.<br><br>Freedom of thought and of the press are usually attacked by arguments<br>which are not worth bothering about. Anyone who has experience of<br>lecturing and debating knows them off backwards. Here I am not trying to<br>deal with the familiar claim that freedom is an illusion, or with the<br>claim that there is more freedom in totalitarian countries than in<br>democratic ones, but with the much more tenable and dangerous proposition<br>that freedom is undesirable and that intellectual honesty is a form of<br>anti-social selfishness. Although other aspects of the question are<br>usually in the foreground, the controversy over freedom of speech and of<br>the press is at bottom a controversy of the desirability, or otherwise,<br>of telling lies. What is really at issue is the right to report<br>contemporary events truthfully, or as truthfully as is consistent with<br>the ignorance, bias and self-deception from which every observer<br>necessarily suffers. In saying this I may seem to be saying that<br>straightforward "reportage" is the only branch of literature that<br>matters: but I will try to show later that at every literary level, and<br>probably in every one of the arts, the same issue arises in more or less<br>subtilized forms. Meanwhile, it is necessary to strip away the<br>irrelevancies in which this controversy is usually wrapped up.<br><br>The enemies of intellectual liberty always try to present their case as a<br>plea for discipline versus individualism. The issue truth-versus-untruth<br>is as far as possible kept in the background. Although the point of<br>emphasis may vary, the writer who refuses to sell his opinions is always<br>branded as a mere egoist. He is accused, that is, of either wanting to<br>shut himself up in an ivory tower, or of making an exhibitionist display<br>of his own personality, or of resisting the inevitable current of history<br>in an attempt to cling to unjustified privilege. The Catholic and the<br>Communist are alike in assuming that an opponent cannot be both honest<br>and intelligent. Each of them tacitly claims that "the truth" has already<br>been revealed, and that the heretic, if he is not simply a fool, is<br>secretly aware of "the truth" and merely resists it out of selfish<br>motives. In Communist literature the attack on intellectual liberty is<br>usually masked by oratory about "petty-bourgeois individualism", "the<br>illusions of nineteenth-century liberalism", etc., and backed up by words<br>of abuse such as "romantic" and "sentimental", which, since they do not<br>have any agreed meaning, are difficult to answer. In this way the<br>controversy is maneuvered away from its real issue. One can accept, and<br>most enlightened people would accept, the Communist thesis that pure<br>freedom will only exist in a classless society, and that one is most<br>nearly free when one is working to bring such a society about. But<br>slipped in with this is the quite unfounded claim that the Communist<br>Party is itself aiming at the establishment of the classless society, and<br>that in the U.S.S.R. this aim is actually on the way to being realized.<br>If the first claim is allowed to entail the second, there is almost no<br>assault on common sense and common decency that cannot be justified. But<br>meanwhile, the real point has been dodged. Freedom of the intellect means<br>the freedom to report what one has seen, heard, and felt, and not to be<br>obliged to fabricate imaginary facts and feelings. The familiar tirades<br>against "escapism" and "individualism", "romanticism", and so forth, are<br>merely a forensic device, the aim of which is to make the perversion of<br>history seem respectable.<br><br>Fifteen years ago, when one defended the freedom of the intellect, one<br>had to defend it against Conservatives, against Catholics, and to some<br>extent--for they were not of great importance in England--against<br>Fascists. Today one has to defend it against Communists and<br>"fellow-travelers". One ought not to exaggerate the direct influence of<br>the small English Communist Party, but there can be no question about the<br>poisonous effect of the Russian MYTHOS on English intellectual life.<br>Because of it known facts are suppressed and distorted to such an extent<br>as to make it doubtful whether a true history of our times can ever be<br>written. Let me give just one instance out of the hundreds that could be<br>cited. When Germany collapsed, it was found that very large numbers of<br>Soviet Russians--mostly, no doubt, from non-political motives--had<br>changed sides and were fighting for the Germans. Also, a small but not<br>negligible portion of the Russian prisoners and displaced persons refused<br>to go back to the U.S.S.R., and some of them, at least, were repatriated<br>against their will. These facts, known to many journalists on the spot,<br>went almost unmentioned in the British press, while at the same time<br>Russophile publicists in England continued to justify the purges and<br>deportations of 1936-38 by claiming that the U.S.S.R. "had no quislings".<br>The fog of lies and misinformation that surrounds such subjects as the<br>Ukraine famine, the Spanish civil war, Russian policy in Poland, and so<br>forth, is not due entirely to conscious dishonesty, but any writer or<br>journalist who is fully sympathetic for the U.S.S.R.--sympathetic, that<br>is, in the way the Russians themselves would want him to be--does have<br>to acquiesce in deliberate falsification on important issues. I have<br>before me what must be a very rare pamphlet, written by Maxim Litvinoff<br>in 1918 and outlining the recent events in the Russian Revolution. It<br>makes no mention of Stalin, but gives high praise to Trotsky, and also to<br>Zinoviev, Kamenev, and others. What could be the attitude of even the<br>most intellectually scrupulous Communist towards such a pamphlet? At<br>best, the obscurantist attitude of saying that it is an undesirable<br>document and better suppressed. And if for some reason it were decided to<br>issue a garbled version of the pamphlet, denigrating Trotsky and<br>inserting references to Stalin, no Communist who remained faithful to his<br>party could protest. Forgeries almost as gross as this have been<br>committed in recent years. But the significant thing is not that they<br>happen, but that, even when they are known about, they provoke no<br>reaction from the left-wing intelligentsia as a whole. The argument that<br>to tell the truth would be "inopportune" or would "play into the hands<br>of" somebody or other is felt to be unanswerable, and few people are<br>bothered by the prospect of the lies which they condone getting out of<br>the newspapers and into the history books.<br><br>The organized lying practiced by totalitarian states is not, as is<br>sometimes claimed, a temporary expedient of the same nature as military<br>deception. It is something integral to totalitarianism, something that<br>would still continue even if concentration camps and secret police forces<br>had ceased to be necessary. Among intelligent Communists there is an<br>underground legend to the effect that although the Russian government is<br>obliged now to deal in lying propaganda, frame-up trials, and so forth,<br>it is secretly recording the true facts and will publish them at some<br>future time. We can, I believe, be quite certain that this is not the<br>case, because the mentality implied by such an action is that of a<br>liberal historian who believes that the past cannot be altered and that a<br>correct knowledge of history is valuable as a matter of course. From the<br>totalitarian point of view history is something to be created rather than<br>learned. A totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling<br>caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible.<br>But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary<br>to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was<br>not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened. Then<br>again, every major change in policy demands a corresponding change of<br>doctrine and a revelation of prominent historical figures. This kind of<br>thing happens everywhere, but is clearly likelier to lead to outright<br>falsification in societies where only one opinion is permissible at any<br>given moment. Totalitarianism demands, in fact, the continuous alteration<br>of the past, and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very<br>existence of objective truth. The friends of totalitarianism in this<br>country usually tend to argue that since absolute truth is not<br>attainable, a big lie is no worse than a little lie. It is pointed out<br>that all historical records are biased and inaccurate, or on the other<br>hand, that modern physics has proven that what seems to us the real world<br>is an illusion, so that to believe in the evidence of one's senses is<br>simply vulgar philistinism. A totalitarian society which succeeded in<br>perpetuating itself would probably set up a schizophrenic system of<br>thought, in which the laws of common sense held good in everyday life and<br>in certain exact sciences, but could be disregarded by the politician,<br>the historian, and the sociologist. Already there are countless people<br>who would think it scandalous to falsify a scientific textbook, but would<br>see nothing wrong in falsifying an historical fact. It is at the point<br>where literature and politics cross that totalitarianism exerts its<br>greatest pressure on the intellectual. The exact sciences are not, at<br>this date, menaced to anything like the same extent. This partly accounts<br>for the fact that in all countries it is easier for the scientists than<br>for the writers to line up behind their respective governments.<br><br>To keep the matter in perspective, let me repeat what I said at the<br>beginning of this essay: that in England the immediate enemies of<br>truthfulness, and hence of freedom of thought, are the press lords, the<br>film magnates, and the bureaucrats, but that on a long view the weakening<br>of the desire for liberty among the intellectuals themselves is the most<br>serious symptom of all. It may seem that all this time I have been<br>talking about the effects of censorship, not on literature as a whole,<br>but merely on one department of political journalism. Granted that Soviet<br>Russia constitutes a sort of forbidden area in the British press, granted<br>that issues like Poland, the Spanish civil war, the Russo-German pact,<br>and so forth, are debarred from serious discussion, and that if you<br>possess information that conflicts with the prevailing orthodoxy you are<br>expected to either distort it or keep quiet about it--granted all this,<br>why should literature in the wider sense be affected? Is every writer a<br>politician, and is every book necessarily a work of straightforward<br>"reportage"? Even under the tightest dictatorship, cannot the individual<br>writer remain free inside his own mind and distill or disguise his<br>unorthodox ideas in such a way that the authorities will be too stupid to<br>recognize them? And in any case, if the writer himself is in agreement<br>with the prevailing orthodoxy, why should it have a cramping effect on<br>him? Is not literature, or any of the arts, likeliest to flourish in<br>societies in which there are no major conflicts of opinion and no sharp<br>distinction between the artist and his audience? Does one have to assume<br>that every writer is a rebel, or even that a writer as such is an<br>exceptional person?<br><br>Whenever one attempts to defend intellectual liberty against the claims<br>of totalitarianism, one meets with these arguments in one form or<br>another. They are based on a complete misunderstanding of what literature<br>is, and how--one should perhaps say why--it comes into being. They<br>assume that a writer is either a mere entertainer or else a venal hack<br>who can switch from one line of propaganda to another as easily as an<br>organ grinder changing tunes. But after all, how is it that books ever<br>come to be written? Above a quite low level, literature is an attempt to<br>influence the viewpoint of one's contemporaries by recording experience.<br>And so far as freedom of expression is concerned, there is not much<br>difference between a mere journalist and the most "unpolitical"<br>imaginative writer. The journalist is unfree, and is conscious of<br>unfreedom, when he is forced to write lies or suppress what seems to him<br>important news; the imaginative writer is unfree when he has to falsify<br>his subjective feelings, which from his point of view are facts. He may<br>distort and caricature reality in order to make his meaning clearer, but<br>he cannot misrepresent the scenery of his own mind; he cannot say with<br>any conviction that he likes what he dislikes, or believes what he<br>disbelieves. If he is forced to do so, the only result is that his<br>creative faculties will dry up. Nor can he solve the problem by keeping<br>away from controversial topics. There is no such thing as a genuinely<br>non-political literature, and least of all in an age like our own, when<br>fears, hatreds, and loyalties of a directly political kind are near to<br>the surface of everyone's consciousness. Even a single taboo can have an<br>all-round crippling effect upon the mind, because there is always the<br>danger that any thought which is freely followed up may lead to the<br>forbidden thought. It follows that the atmosphere of totalitarianism is<br>deadly to any kind of prose writer, though a poet, at any rate a lyric<br>poet, might possibly find it breathable. And in any totalitarian society<br>that survives for more than a couple of generations, it is probable that<br>prose literature, of the kind that has existed during the past four<br>hundred years, must actually come to an end.<br><br>Literature has sometimes flourished under despotic regimes, but, as has<br>often been pointed out, the despotisms of the past were not totalitarian.<br>Their repressive apparatus was always inefficient, their ruling classes<br>were usually either corrupt or apathetic or half-liberal in outlook, and<br>the prevailing religious doctrines usually worked against perfectionism<br>and the notion of human infallibility. Even so it is broadly true that<br>prose literature has reached its highest levels in periods of democracy<br>and free speculation. What is new in totalitarianism is that its<br>doctrines are not only unchallengeable but also unstable. They have to be<br>accepted on pain of damnation, but on the other hand, they are always<br>liable to be altered on a moment's notice. Consider, for example, the<br>various attitudes, completely incompatible with one another, which an<br>English Communist or "fellow-traveler" has had to adopt toward the war<br>between Britain and Germany. For years before September, 1939, he was<br>expected to be in a continuous stew about "the horrors of Nazism" and to<br>twist everything he wrote into a denunciation of Hitler: after September,<br>1939, for twenty months, he had to believe that Germany was more sinned<br>against than sinning, and the word "Nazi", at least as far as print went,<br>had to drop right out of his vocabulary. Immediately after hearing the 8<br>o'clock news bulletin on the morning of June 22, 1941, he had to start<br>believing once again that Nazism was the most hideous evil the world had<br>ever seen. Now, it is easy for the politician to make such changes: for a<br>writer the case is somewhat different. If he is to switch his allegiance<br>at exactly the right moment, he must either tell lies about his<br>subjective feelings, or else suppress them altogether. In either case he<br>has destroyed his dynamo. Not only will ideas refuse to come to him, but<br>the very words he uses will seem to stiffen under his touch. Political<br>writing in our time consists almost entirely of prefabricated phrases<br>bolted together like the pieces of a child's Meccano set. It is the<br>unavoidable result of self-censorship. To write in plain, vigorous<br>language one has to think fearlessly, and if one thinks fearlessly one<br>cannot be politically orthodox. It might be otherwise in an "age of<br>faith", when the prevailing orthodoxy has long been established and is<br>not taken too seriously. In that case it would be possible, or might be<br>possible, for large areas of one's mind to remain unaffected by what one<br>officially believed. Even so, it is worth noticing that prose literature<br>almost disappeared during the only age of faith that Europe has ever<br>enjoyed. Throughout the whole of the Middle Ages there was almost no<br>imaginative prose literature and very little in the way of historical<br>writing; and the intellectual leaders of society expressed their most<br>serious thoughts in a dead language which barley altered during a<br>thousand years.<br><br>Totalitarianism, however, does not so much promise an age of faith as an<br>age of schizophrenia. A society becomes totalitarian when its structure<br>becomes flagrantly artificial: that is, when its ruling class has lost<br>its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud. Such a<br>society, no matter how long it persists, can never afford to become<br>either tolerant or intellectually stable. It can never permit either the<br>truthful recording of facts or the emotional sincerity that literary<br>creation demands. But to be corrupted by totalitarianism one does not<br>have to live in a totalitarian country. The mere prevalence of certain<br>ideas can spread a kind of poison that makes one subject after another<br>impossible for literary purposes. Wherever there is an enforced orthodoxy<br>--or even two orthodoxies, as often happens--good writing stops. This<br>was well illustrated by the Spanish civil war. To many English<br>intellectuals the war was a deeply moving experience, but not an<br>experience about which they could write sincerely. There were only two<br>things that you were allowed to say, and both of them were palpable lies:<br>as a result, the war produced acres of print but almost nothing worth<br>reading.<br><br>It is not certain whether the effects of totalitarianism upon verse need<br>be so deadly as its effects on prose. There is a whole series of<br>converging reasons why it is somewhat easier for a poet than a prose<br>writer to feel at home in an authoritarian society. To begin with,<br>bureaucrats and other "practical" men usually despise the poet too deeply<br>to be much interested in what he is saying. Secondly, what the poet is<br>saying--that is, what his poem "means" if translated into prose--is<br>relatively unimportant, even to himself. The thought contained in a poem<br>is always simple, and is no more the primary purpose of the poem than the<br>anecdote is the primary purpose of the picture. A poem is an arrangement<br>of sounds and associations, as a painting is an arrangement of<br>brushmarks. For short snatches, indeed, as in the refrain of a song,<br>poetry can even dispense with meaning altogether. It is therefore fairly<br>easy for a poet to keep away from dangerous subjects and avoid uttering<br>heresies; and even when he does utter them, they may escape notice. But<br>above all, good verse, unlike good prose, is not necessarily and<br>individual product. Certain kinds of poems, such as ballads, or, on the<br>other hand, very artificial verse forms, can be composed co-operatively<br>by groups of people. Whether the ancient English and Scottish ballads<br>were originally produced by individuals, or by the people at large, is<br>disputed; but at any rate they are non-individual in the sense that they<br>constantly change in passing from mouth to mouth. Even in print no two<br>versions of a ballad are ever quite the same. Many primitive peoples<br>compose verse communally. Someone begins to improvise, probably<br>accompanying himself on a musical instrument, somebody else chips in with<br>a line or a rhyme when the first singer breaks down, and so the process<br>continues until there exists a whole song or ballad which has no<br>identifiable author.<br><br>In prose, this kind of intimate collaboration is quite impossible.<br>Serious prose, in any case, has to be composed in solitude, whereas the<br>excitement of being part of a group is actually an aid to certain kinds<br>of versification. Verse--and perhaps good verse of its own kind, though<br>it would not be the highest kind--might survive under even the most<br>inquisitorial régime. Even in a society where liberty and individuality<br>had been extinguished, there would still be a need either for patriotic<br>songs and heroic ballads celebrating victories, or for elaborate<br>exercises in flattery; and these are the kinds of poems that can be<br>written to order, or composed communally, without necessarily lacking<br>artistic value. Prose is a different matter, since the prose writer<br>cannot narrow the range of his thoughts without killing his<br>inventiveness. But the history of totalitarian societies, or of groups of<br>people who have adopted the totalitarian outlook, suggests that loss of<br>liberty is inimical to all forms of literature. German literature almost<br>disappeared during the Hitler régime, and the case was not much better in<br>Italy. Russian literature, so far as one can judge by translations, has<br>deteriorated markedly since the early days of the revolution, though some<br>of the verse appears to be better than the prose. Few if any Russian<br>novels that it is possible to take seriously have been translated for<br>about fifteen years. In western Europe and America large sections of the<br>literary intelligentsia have either passed through the Communist Party or<br>have been warmly sympathetic to it, but this whole leftward movement has<br>produced extraordinarily few books worth reading. Orthodox Catholicism,<br>again, seems to have a crushing effect upon certain literary forms,<br>especially the novel. During a period of three hundred years, how many<br>people have been at once good novelists and good Catholics? The fact is<br>that certain themes cannot be celebrated in words, and tyranny is one of<br>them. No one ever wrote a good book in praise of the Inquisition. Poetry<br>might survive in a totalitarian age, and certain arts or half-arts, such<br>as architecture, might even find tyranny beneficial, but the prose writer<br>would have no choice between silence or death. Prose literature as we<br>know it is the product of rationalism, of the Protestant centuries, of<br>the autonomous individual. And the destruction of intellectual liberty<br>cripples the journalist, the sociological writer, the historian, the<br>novelist, the critic, and the poet, in that order. In the future it is<br>possible that a new kind of literature, not involving individual feeling<br>or truthful observation, may arise, but no such thing is at present<br>imaginable. It seems much likelier that if the liberal culture that we<br>have lived in since the Renaissance comes to an end, the literary art<br>will perish with it.<br><br>Of course, print will continue to be used, and it is interesting to<br>speculate what kinds of reading matter would survive in a rigidly<br>totalitarian society. Newspapers will presumably continue until<br>television technique reaches a higher level, but apart from newspapers it<br>is doubtful even now whether the great mass of people in the<br>industrialized countries feel the need for any kind of literature. They<br>are unwilling, at any rate, to spend anywhere near as much on reading<br>matter as they spend on several other recreations. Probably novels and<br>stories will be completely superseded by film and radio productions. Or<br>perhaps some kind of low grade sensational fiction will survive, produced<br>by a sort of conveyor-belt process that reduces human initiative to the<br>minimum.<br><br>It would probably not be beyond human ingenuity to write books by<br>machinery. But a sort of mechanizing process can already be seen at work<br>in the film and radio, in publicity and propaganda, and in the lower<br>reaches of journalism. The Disney films, for instance, are produced by<br>what is essentially a factory process, the work being done partly<br>mechanically and partly by teams of artists who have to subordinate their<br>individual style. Radio features are commonly written by tired hacks to<br>whom the subject and the manner of treatment are dictated beforehand:<br>even so, what they write is merely a kind of raw material to be chopped<br>into shape by producers and censors. So also with the innumerable books<br>and pamphlets commissioned by government departments. Even more<br>machine-like is the production of short stories, serials, and poems for<br>the very cheap magazines. Papers such as the WRITER abound with<br>advertisements of literary schools, all of them offering you ready-made<br>plots at a few shillings a time. Some, together with the plot, supply the<br>opening and closing sentences of each chapter. Others furnish you with a<br>sort of algebraical formula by the use of which you can construct plots<br>for yourself. Others have packs of cards marked with characters and<br>situations, which have only to be shuffled and dealt in order to produce<br>ingenious stories automatically. It is probably in some such way that the<br>literature of a totalitarian society would be produced, if literature<br>were still felt to be necessary. Imagination--even consciousness, so far<br>as possible--would be eliminated from the process of writing. Books<br>would be planned in their broad lines by bureaucrats, and would pass<br>through so many hands that when finished they would be no more an<br>individual product than a Ford car at the end of the assembly line. It<br>goes without saying that anything so produced would be rubbish; but<br>anything that was not rubbish would endanger the structure of the state.<br>As for the surviving literature of the past, it would have to be<br>suppressed or at least elaborately rewritten.<br><br>Meanwhile, totalitarianism has not fully triumphed anywhere. Our own<br>society is still, broadly speaking, liberal. To exercise your right of<br>free speech you have to fight against economic pressure and against<br>strong sections of public opinion, but not, as yet, against a secret<br>police force. You can say or print almost anything so long as you are<br>willing to do it in a hole-and-corner way. But what is sinister, as I<br>said at the beginning of this essay, is that the conscious enemies of<br>liberty are those to whom liberty ought to mean most. The big public do<br>not care about the matter one way or the other. They are not in favour of<br>persecuting the heretic, and they will not exert themselves to defend<br>him. They are at once too sane and too stupid to acquire the totalitarian<br>outlook. The direct, conscious attack on intellectual decency comes from<br>the intellectuals themselves.<br><br>It is possible that the Russophile intelligentsia, if they had not<br>succumbed to that particular myth, would have succumbed to another of<br>much the same kind. But at any rate the Russian myth is there, and the<br>corruption it causes stinks. When one sees highly educated men looking on<br>indifferently at oppression and persecution, one wonders which to despise<br>more, their cynicism or their shortsightedness. Many scientists, for<br>example, are the uncritical admirers of the U.S.S.R. They appear to think<br>that the destruction of liberty is of no importance so long as their own<br>line of work is for the moment unaffected. The U.S.S.R. is a large,<br>rapidly developing country which has an acute need of scientific workers<br>and, consequently, treats them generously. Provided that they steer clear<br>of dangerous subjects such as psychology, scientists are privileged<br>persons. Writers, on the other hand, are viciously persecuted. It is true<br>that literary prostitutes like Ilya Ehrenburg or Alexei Tolstoy are paid<br>huge sums of money, but the only thing which is of any value to the<br>writer as such--his freedom of expression--is taken away from him.<br>Some, at least, of the English scientists who speak so enthusiastically<br>of the opportunities to be enjoyed by scientists in Russia are capable of<br>understanding this. But their reflection appears to be: "Writers are<br>persecuted in Russia. So what? I am not a writer." They do not see that<br>any attack on intellectual liberty, and on the concept of objective<br>truth, threatens in the long run every department of thought.<br><br>For the moment the totalitarian state tolerates the scientist because it<br>needs him. Even in Nazi Germany, scientists, other than Jews, were<br>relatively well treated and the German scientific community, as a whole,<br>offered no resistance to Hitler. At this stage of history, even the most<br>autocratic ruler is forced to take account of physical reality, partly<br>because of the lingering-on of liberal habits of thought, partly because<br>of the need to prepare for war. So long as physical reality cannot<br>altogether be ignored, so long as two and two have to make four when you<br>are, for example, drawing the blueprint of an aeroplane, the scientist<br>has his function, and can even be allowed a measure of liberty. His<br>awakening will come later, when the totalitarian state is firmly<br>established. Meanwhile, if he wants to safeguard the integrity of<br>science, it is his job to develop some kind of solidarity with his<br>literary colleagues and not disregard it as a matter of indifference when<br>writers are silenced or driven to suicide, and newspapers systematically<br>falsified.<br><br>But however it may be with the physical sciences, or with music, painting<br>and architecture, it is--as I have tried to show--certain that<br>literature is doomed if liberty of thought perishes. Not only is it<br>doomed in any country which retains a totalitarian structure; but any<br>writer who adopts the totalitarian outlook, who finds excuses for<br>persecution and the falsification of reality, thereby destroys himself as<br>a writer. There is no way out of this. No tirades against "individualism"<br>and the "ivory tower", no pious platitudes to the effect that "true<br>individuality is only attained through identification with the<br>community", can get over the fact that a bought mind is a spoiled mind.<br>Unless spontaneity enters at some point or another, literary creation is<br>impossible, and language itself becomes something totally different from<br>what it is now, we may learn to separate literary creation from<br>intellectual honesty. At present we know only that the imagination, like<br>certain wild animals, will not breed in captivity. Any writer or<br>journalist who denies that fact--and nearly all the current praise of<br>the Soviet Union contains or implies such a denial--is, in effect,<br>demanding his own destruction.<br><br></font></p>
