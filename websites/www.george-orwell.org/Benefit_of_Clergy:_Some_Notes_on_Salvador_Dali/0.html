<h2>Essay</h2><br />                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something<br>disgraceful. A man who gives a good account of himself is probably lying,<br>since any life when viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats.<br>However, even the most flagrantly dishonest book (Frank Harris's<br>autobiographical writings are an example) can without intending it give a<br>true picture of its author. Dali's recently published LIFE comes under<br>this heading. Some of the incidents in it are flatly incredible, others<br>have been rearranged and romanticised, and not merely the humiliation but<br>the persistent ORDINARINESS of everyday life has been cut out. Dali is<br>even by his own diagnosis narcissistic, and his autobiography is simply a<br>strip-tease act conducted in pink limelight. But as a record of fantasy,<br>of the perversion of instinct that has been made possible by the machine<br>age, it has great value.<br><br>Here, then, are some of the episodes in Dali's life, from his earliest<br>years onward. Which of them are true and which are imaginary hardly<br>matters: the point is that this is the kind of thing that Dali would have<br>LIKED to do.<br><br>When he is six years old there is some excitement over the appearance of<br>Halley's comet:<br><br><br>Suddenly one of my father's office clerks appeared in the drawing-room<br>doorway and announced that the comet could be seen from the terrace. . .<br>While crossing the hall I caught sight of my little three-year-old sister<br>crawling unobtrusively through a doorway. I stopped, hesitated a second,<br>then gave her a terrible kick in the head as though it had been a ball,<br>and continued running, carried away with a 'delirious joy' induced by<br>this savage act. But my father, who was behind me, caught me and led me<br>down in to his office, where I remained as a punishment till dinner-time.<br><br><br>A year earlier than this Dali had 'suddenly, as most of my ideas occur,'<br>flung another little boy off a suspension bridge. Several other incidents<br>of the same kind are recorded, including (THIS WAS WHEN HE WAS<br>TWENTY-NINE YEARS OLD) knocking down and trampling on a girl 'until they<br>had to tear her, bleeding, out of my reach.'<br><br>When he is about five he gets hold of a wounded bat which he puts into a<br>tin pail. Next morning he finds that the bat is almost dead and is<br>covered with ants which are devouring it. He puts it in his mouth, ants<br>and all, and bites it almost in half.<br><br>When he is an adolescent a girl falls desperately in love with him. He<br>kisses and caresses her so as to excite her as much as possible, but<br>refuses to go further. He resolves to keep this up for five years (he<br>calls it his 'five-year plan'), enjoying her humiliation and the sense of<br>power it gives him. He frequently tells her that at the end of the five<br>years he will desert her, and when the time comes he does so.<br><br>Till well into adult life he keeps up the practice of masturbation, and<br>likes to do this, apparently, in front of a looking-glass. For ordinary<br>purposes he is impotent, it appears, till the age of thirty or so. When<br>he first meets his future wife, Gala, he is greatly tempted to push her<br>off a precipice. He is aware that there is something that she wants him<br>to do to her, and after their first kiss the confession is made:<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I threw back Gala's head, pulling it by the hair, and trembling with<br>complete hysteria, I commanded:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Now tell me what you want me to do with you! But tell me slowly, looking<br>me in the eye, with the crudest, the most ferociously erotic words that<br>can make both of us feel the greatest shame!'<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Gala, transforming the last glimmer of her expression of pleasure<br>into the hard light of her own tyranny, answered:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I want you to kill me!'<br><br><br>He is somewhat disappointed by this demand, since it is merely what he<br>wanted to do already. He contemplates throwing her off the bell-tower of<br>the Cathedral of Toledo, but refrains from doing so.<br><br>During the Spanish Civil War he astutely avoids taking sides, and makes a<br>trip to Italy. He feels himself more and more drawn towards the<br>aristocracy, frequents smart SALONS, finds himself wealthy patrons, and<br>is photographed with the plump Vicomte de Noailles, whom he describes as<br>his 'Maecenas.' When the European War approaches he has one preoccupation<br>only: how to find a place which has good cookery and from which he can<br>make a quick bolt if danger comes too near. He fixes on Bordeaux, and<br>duly flees to Spain during the Battle of France. He stays in Spain long<br>enough to pick up a few anti-red atrocity stories, then makes for<br>America. The story ends in a blaze of respectability. Dali, at<br>thirty-seven, has become a devoted husband, is cured of his aberrations,<br>or some of them, and is completely reconciled to the Catholic Church. He<br>is also, one gathers, making a good deal of money.<br><br>However, he has by no means ceased to take pride in the pictures of his<br>Surrealist period, with titles like 'The Great Masturbator', 'Sodomy of a<br>Skull with a Grand Piano', etc. There are reproductions of these all the<br>way through the book. Many of Dali's drawings are simply representational<br>and have a characteristic to be noted later. But from his Surrealist<br>paintings and photographs the two things that stand our are sexual<br>perversity and necrophilia. Sexual objects and symbols--some of them<br>well known, like our old friend the high-heeled slipper, others, like the<br>crutch and the cup of warm milk, patented by Dali himself--recur over<br>and over again, and there is a fairly well-marked excretory motif as<br>well. In his painting, Le Jeu Lugubre, he says, 'the drawers bespattered<br>with excrement were painted with such minute and realistic complacency<br>that the whole little Surrealist group was anguished by the question: Is<br>he coprophagic or not?' Dali adds firmly that he is NOT, and that he<br>regards this aberration as 'repulsive', but it seems to be only at that<br>point that his interest in excrement stops. Even when he recounts the<br>experience of watching a woman urinate standing up, he has to add the<br>detail that she misses her aim and dirties her shoes. It is not given to<br>any one person to have all the vices, and Dali also boasts that he is not<br>homosexual, but otherwise he seems to have as good an outfit of<br>perversions as anyone could wish for.<br><br>However, his most notable characteristic is his necrophilia. He himself<br>freely admits to this, and claims to have been cured of it. Dead faces,<br>skulls, corpses of animals occur fairly frequently in his pictures, and<br>the ants which devoured the dying bat make countless reappearances. One<br>photograph shows an exhumed corpse, far gone in decomposition. Another<br>shows the dead donkeys putrefying on top of grand pianos which formed<br>part of the Surrealist film, Le Chien Andalou. Dali still looks back on<br>these donkeys with great enthusiasm.<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 'made up' the putrefaction of the donkeys with great pots of sticky<br>glue which I poured over them. Also I emptied their eye-sockets and made<br>them larger by hacking them out with scissors. In the same way I<br>furiously cut their mouths open to make the rows of their teeth show to<br>better advantage, and I added several jaws to each mouth, so that it<br>would appear that although the donkeys were already rotting they were<br>vomiting up a little more their own death, above those other rows of<br>teeth formed by the keys of the black pianos.<br><br><br>And finally there is the picture--apparently some kind of faked<br>photograph--of 'Mannequin rotting in a taxicab.' Over the already<br>somewhat bloated face and breast of the apparently dead girl, huge snails<br>were crawling. In the caption below the picture Dali notes that these are<br>Burgundy snails--that is, the edible kind.<br><br>Of course, in this long book of 400 quarto pages there is more than I<br>have indicated, but I do not think that I have given an unfair account of<br>his moral atmosphere and mental scenery. It is a book that stinks. If it<br>were possible for a book to give a physical stink off its pages, this one<br>would--a thought that might please Dali, who before wooing his future<br>wife for the first time rubbed himself all over with an ointment made of<br>goat's dung boiled up in fish glue. But against this has to be set the<br>fact that Dali is a draughtsman of very exceptional gifts. He is also, to<br>judge by the minuteness and the sureness of his drawings, a very hard<br>worker. He is an exhibitionist and a careerist, but he is not a fraud. He<br>has fifty times more talent than most of the people who would denounce<br>his morals and jeer at his paintings. And these two sets of facts, taken<br>together, raise a question which for lack of any basis of agreement<br>seldom gets a real discussion.<br><br>The point is that you have here a direct, unmistakable assault on sanity<br>and decency; and even--since some of Dali's pictures would tend to<br>poison the imagination like a pornographic postcard--on life itself.<br>What Dali has done and what he has imagined is debatable, but in his<br>outlook, his character, the bedrock decency of a human being does not<br>exist. He is as anti-social as a flea. Clearly, such people are<br>undesirable, and a society in which they can flourish has something wrong<br>with it.<br><br>Now, if you showed this book, with its illustrations, to Lord Elton, to<br>Mr. Alfred Noyes, to THE TIMES leader writers who exult over the 'eclipse<br>of the highbrow'--in fact, to any 'sensible' art-hating English person--<br>it is easy to imagine what kind of response you would get. They would<br>flatly refuse to see any merit in Dali whatever. Such people are not only<br>unable to admit that what is morally degraded can be asthetically right,<br>but their real demand of every artist is that he shall pat them on the<br>back and tell them that thought is unnecessary. And they can be<br>especially dangerous at a time like the present, when the Ministry of<br>Information and the British Council put power into their hands. For their<br>impulse is not only to crush every new talent as it appears, but to<br>castrate the past as well. Witness the renewed highbrow-baiting that is<br>now going on in this country and America, with its outcry not only<br>against Joyce, Proust and Lawrence, but even against T. S. Eliot.<br><br>But if you talk to the kind of person who CAN see Dali's merits, the<br>response that you get is not as a rule very much better. If you say that<br>Dali, though a brilliant draughtsman, is a dirty little scoundrel, you<br>are looked upon as a savage. If you say that you don't like rotting<br>corpses, and that people who do like rotting corpses are mentally<br>diseased, it is assumed that you lack the aesthetic sense. Since<br>'Mannequin rotting in a taxicab' is a good composition. And between these<br>two fallacies there is no middle position, but we seldom hear much about<br>it. On the one side KULTURBOLSCHEVISMUS: on the other (though the phrase<br>itself is out of fashion) 'Art for Art's sake.' Obscenity is a very<br>difficult question to discuss honestly. People are too frightened either<br>of seeming to be shocked or of seeming not to be shocked, to be able to<br>define the relationship between art and morals.<br><br>It will be seen that what the defenders of Dali are claiming is a kind of<br>BENEFIT OF CLERGY. The artist is to be exempt from the moral laws that<br>are binding on ordinary people. Just pronounce the magic word 'Art', and<br>everything is O.K.: kicking little girls in the head is O.K.; even a film<br>like L'Age d'Or is O.K. [Note, below] It is also O.K. that Dali should<br>batten on France for years and then scuttle off like rat as soon as France<br>is in danger. So long as you can paint well enough to pass the test, all<br>shall be forgiven you.<br><br><br>[Note: Dali mentions L'Age d'Or and adds that its first public showing was<br>broken up by hooligans, but he does not say in detail what it was about.<br>According to Henry Miller's account of it, it showed among other things<br>some fairly detailed shots of a woman defecating. (Author's Footnote)]<br><br><br>One can see how false this is if one extends it to cover ordinary crime.<br>In an age like our own, when the artist is an altogether exceptional<br>person, he must be allowed a certain amount of irresponsibility, just as<br>a pregnant woman is. Still, no one would say that a pregnant woman should<br>be allowed to commit murder, nor would anyone make such a claim for the<br>artist, however gifted. If Shakespeare returned to the earth to-morrow,<br>and if it were found that his favourite recreation was raping little<br>girls in railway carriages, we should not tell him to go ahead with it on<br>the ground that he might write another KING LEAR. And, after all, the<br>worst crimes are not always the punishable ones. By encouraging<br>necrophilic reveries one probably does quite as much harm as by, say,<br>picking pockets at the races. One ought to be able to hold in one's head<br>simultaneously the two facts that Dali is a good draughtsman and a<br>disgusting human being. The one does not invalidate or, in a sense,<br>affect the other. The first thing that we demand of a wall is that it<br>shall stand up. If it stands up, it is a good wall, and the question of<br>what purpose it serves is separable from that. And yet even the best wall<br>in the world deserves to be pulled down if it surrounds a concentration<br>camp. In the same way it should be possible to say, 'This is a good book<br>or a good picture, and it ought to be burned by the public hangman.'<br>Unless one can say that, at least in imagination, one is shirking the<br>implications of the fact that an artist is also a citizen and a human<br>being.<br><br>Not, of course, that Dali's autobiography, or his pictures, ought to be<br>suppressed. Short of the dirty postcards that used to be sold in<br>Mediterranean seaport towns, it is doubtful policy to suppress anything,<br>and Dali's fantasies probably cast useful light on the decay of<br>capitalist civilisation. But what he clearly needs is diagnosis. The<br>question is not so much WHAT he is as WHY he is like that. It ought not<br>to be in doubt that his is a diseased intelligence, probably not much<br>altered by his alleged conversion, since genuine penitents, or people who<br>have returned to sanity, do not flaunt their past vices in that<br>complacent way. He is a symptom of the world's illness. The important<br>thing is not to denounce him as a cad who ought to be horsewhipped, or to<br>defend him as a genius who ought not to be questioned, but to find out<br>WHY he exhibits that particular set of aberrations.<br><br>The answer is probably discoverable in his pictures, and those I myself<br>am not competent to examine. But I can point to one clue which perhaps<br>takes one part of the distance. This is the old-fashioned, over-ornate<br>Edwardian style of drawing to which Dali tends to revert when he is not<br>being Surrealist. Some of Dali's drawings are reminiscent of Dürer, one<br>(p. 113) seems to show the influence of Beardsley, another (p. 269) seems<br>to borrow something from Blake. But the most persistent strain is the<br>Edwardian one. When I opened the book for the first time and looked at<br>its innumerable marginal illustrations, I was haunted by a resemblance<br>which I could not immediately pin down. I fetched up at the ornamental<br>candlestick at the beginning of Part I (p. 7). What did this remind me<br>of? Finally I tracked it down. It reminded me of a large vulgar,<br>expensively got-up edition of Anatole France (in translation) which must<br>have been published about 1914. That had ornamental chapter headings and<br>tailpieces after this style. Dali's candlestick displays at one end a<br>curly fish-like creature that looks curiously familiar (it seems to be<br>based on the conventional dolphin), and at the other is the burning<br>candle. This candle, which recurs in one picture after another, is a very<br>old friend. You will find it, with the same picturesque gouts of wax<br>arranged on its sides, in those phoney electric lights done up as<br>candlesticks which are popular in sham-Tudor country hotels. This candle,<br>and the design beneath it, convey at once an intense feeling of<br>sentimentality. As though to counteract this, Dali has spattered a<br>quill-ful of ink all over the page, but without avail. The same<br>impression keeps popping up on page after page. The sign at the bottom of<br>page 62, for instance, would nearly go into PETER PAN. The figure on page<br>224, in spite of having her cranium elongated in to an immense<br>sausage-like shape, is the witch of the fairy-tale books. The horse on<br>page 234 and the unicorn on page 218 might be illustrations to James<br>Branch Cabell. The rather pansified drawings of youths on pages 97, 100<br>and elsewhere convey the same impression. Picturesqueness keeps breaking<br>in. Take away the skulls, ants, lobsters, telephones and other<br>paraphernalia, and every now and again you are back in the world of<br>Barrie, Rackham, Dunsany and WHERE THE RAINBOW ENDS.<br><br>Curiously, enough, some of the naughty-naughty touches in Dali's<br>autobiography tie up with the same period. When I read the passage I<br>quoted at the beginning, about the kicking of the little sister's head, I<br>was aware of another phantom resemblance. What was it? Of course!<br>RUTHLESS RHYMES FOR HEARTLESS HOMES, by Harry Graham. Such rhymes were<br>very popular round about 1912, and one that ran:<br><br>Poor little Willy is crying so sore,<br>A sad little boy is he,<br>For he's broken his little sister's neck<br>And he'll have no jam for tea,<br><br>might almost have been founded on Dali's anecdote. Dali, of course, is<br>aware of his Edwardian leanings, and makes capital out of them, more or<br>less in a spirit of pastiche. He professes an especial affection for the<br>year 1900, and claims that every ornamental object of 1900 is full of<br>mystery, poetry, eroticism, madness, perversity, et. Pastiche, however,<br>usually implies a real affection for the thing parodied. It seems to be,<br>if not the rule, at any rate distinctly common for an intellectual bent<br>to be accompanied by a non-rational, even childish urge in the same<br>direction. A sculptor, for instance, is interested in planes and curves,<br>but he is also a person who enjoys the physical act of mucking about with<br>clay or stone. An engineer is a person who enjoys the feel of tools, the<br>noise of dynamos and smell of oil. A psychiatrist usually has a leaning<br>toward some sexual aberration himself. Darwin became a biologist partly<br>because he was a country gentleman and fond of animals. It may be<br>therefore, that Dali's seemingly perverse cult of Edwardian things (for<br>example, his 'discovery' of the 1900 subway entrances) is merely the<br>symptom of a much deeper, less conscious affection. The innumerable,<br>beautifully executed copies of textbook illustrations, solemnly labelled<br>LE ROSSIGNOL, UNE MONTRE and so on, which he scatters all over his<br>margins, may be meant partly as a joke. The little boy in knickerbockers<br>playing with a diabolo on page 103 is a perfect period piece. But perhaps<br>these things are also there because Dali can't help drawing that kind of<br>thing because it is to that period and that style of drawing that he<br>really belongs.<br><br>If so, his aberrations are partly explicable. Perhaps they are a way of<br>assuring himself that he is not commonplace. The two qualities that Dali<br>unquestionably possesses are a gift for drawing and an atrocious egoism.<br>'At seven', he says in the first paragraph of his book, 'I wanted to be<br>Napoleon. And my ambition has been growing steadily ever since.' This is<br>worded in a deliberately startling way, but no doubt it is substantially<br>true. Such feelings are common enough. 'I knew I was a genius', somebody<br>once said to me, 'long before I knew what I was going to be a genius<br>about.' And suppose that you have nothing in you except your egoism and a<br>dexterity that goes no higher than the elbow; suppose that your real gift<br>is for a detailed, academic, representational style of drawing, your real<br>MÉTIER to be an illustrator of scientific textbooks. How then do you<br>become Napoleon?<br><br>There is always one escape: INTO WICKEDNESS. Always do the thing that<br>will shock and wound people. At five, throw a little boy off a bridge,<br>strike an old doctor across the face with a whip and break his spectacles<br>--or, at any rate, dream about doing such things. Twenty years later,<br>gouge the eyes out of dead donkeys with a pair of scissors. Along those<br>lines you can always feel yourself original. And after all, it pays! It<br>is much less dangerous than crime. Making all allowance for the probable<br>suppressions in Dali's autobiography, it is clear that he had not had to<br>suffer for his eccentricities as he would have done in an earlier age. He<br>grew up into the corrupt world of the nineteen-twenties, when<br>sophistication was immensely widespread and every European capital<br>swarmed with aristocrats and RENTIERS who had given up sport and politics<br>and taken to patronising the arts. If you threw dead donkeys at people,<br>they threw money back. A phobia for grasshoppers--which a few decades<br>back would merely have provoked a snigger--was now an interesting<br>'complex' which could be profitably exploited. And when that particular<br>world collapsed before the German Army, America was waiting. You could<br>even top it all up with religious conversion, moving at one hop and<br>without a shadow of repentance from the fashionable SALONS of Paris to<br>Abraham's bosom.<br><br>That, perhaps is the essential outline of Dali's history. But why his<br>aberrations should be the particular ones they were, and why it should be<br>so easy to 'sell' such horrors as rotting corpses to a sophisticated<br>public--those are questions for the psychologist and the sociological<br>critic. Marxist criticism has a short way with such phenomena as<br>Surrealism. They are 'bourgeois decadence' (much play is made with the<br>phrases 'corpse poisons' and 'decaying RENTIER class'), and that is<br>that. But though this probably states a fact, it does not establish a<br>connection. One would still like to know WHY Dali's leaning was towards<br>necrophilia (and not, say, homosexuality), and WHY the RENTIERS and the<br>aristocrats would buy his pictures instead of hunting and making love<br>like their grandfathers. Mere moral disapproval does not get one any<br>further. But neither ought one to pretend, in the name of 'detachment',<br>that such pictures as 'Mannequin rotting in a taxicab' are morally<br>neutral. They are diseased and disgusting, and any investigation ought to<br>start out from that fact.<br><br></font></p>
