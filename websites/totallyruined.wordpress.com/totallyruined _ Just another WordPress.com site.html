Well, I spoke to C again this morning.&nbsp; He is coming back in his own boat. He’ll go to Corfu first and then island hop here, so it’ll be a week or so. </p>
<p>I went back over the blog and deleted most of the ridiculous stuff I had been posting, sometimes two or three times a day. The hysteria did me no credit, and the result was embarrassing. I’ve just left in the couple of entries I’m not too ashamed of.</p>

I heard from Carfilhiot. It was terrible reception, as usual. Apparently there was some kind of problem at the Albanian end, but it’s all sorted now and he’s coming home. On the phone I think I was angry with him. I was a bit drunk as usual. But when I pressed End, I just burst into tears and screamed and everything. It was the first time I’d broken down since he went. </p>
<p>You see, I’d begun to suspect that it was all a put-up job, and that he’d done a runner to get rid of me. And you know how that feeds on itself. </p>

Now I’m at my wits end, because I went to Albania. It’s very nice there really, and people were quite helpful, but they looked at me a bit funny, as a lone female. </p>
<p>I found the address and tried to get some sense out of them, but they just shrugged and looked stupid. I got nowhere at all. I came back the same day having achieved nothing. </p>
<p>I went back to the British consul in Corfu. He was very nice, but, as he pointed out, it was hardly his problem, as his embassy is in Athens. But he relayed a message to his counterpart in Albania. </p>
<p>I called Alexis. He hasn’t heard. I didn’t expect him to have, but I had to ask. </p>
<p>I don’t know what else to do. Carfilhiot’s mobile still doesn’t answer and I’m getting very distressed. I keep drinking too much. I just sit in the bar and order drink after drink until I can hardly walk back to the room. Frankly, I think I’m going a bit peculiar again because it’s very dangerous to be a drunk woman by herself in a hotel. </p>
<p>I’m going back to our own island and wait there. At least there’s Alexis who’s just as anxious. I suppose I could contact the Press, but Carfilhiot would be furious, I’m sure, because he wants NO PUBLICITY.</p>

				<p>I am kind of forced to start blogging again, because Carfilhiot has disappeared since his most recent blog entry on 3rd April.</p>
<p>As you will see <a href="http://carfilhiot.co.uk/">in his own blog</a>, he set off optimistically enough, but he just never turned up again. We were going to stay in touch by cell phone because Albania has GSM coverage, it should have been no problem, but his phone was switched off. Of course I left loads of messages.</p>
<p>I was in Corfu a week before I did anything, because Carfilhiot has warned me that absolutely everything takes absolutely ages.</p>
<p>I went and spoke to one of the guys he’d been in the meeting with. He knew nothing.&nbsp; He just looked gloomy and said he hadn’t heard. I pestered him until he gave me an address and telephone number in Saranda which rang, but mostly didn’t reply and when it did nobody spoke English.</p>
<p>I contacted C’s lawyer in Corfu that came to us when they were investigating Ginger. He evidently regards C as a highly suspicious character, which with C’s history, I guess you have to sympathize with. He was just totally unhelpful.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure how Carfilhiot would regard it if I involved the British Consul in Corfu. I mean, I expected to hear from C every hour because he knows my mobile number, so it seemed a bit alarmist. Even if he dropped his mobile overboard, they have telephones in Albania, don’t they? But maybe his phone’s bust and he only had my number on his SIM…</p>
<p>Anyway, what I decided I told the consul I was going to Albania looking for a friend, and if I don’t turn up again, will he send out a search party, please. He kind of grinned at that.</p>
<p>And now I’m telling my readers, if any, that I’m going tomorrow. Please set up a hue and cry if I fail to post, say, in a week.</p>

Well, here I am, in sunny Greece again. Soon as I could, I just took a flight to Athens and then went back to the island I was at last Easter. I guess more in hope than anything else. It took me several days to pluck up courage to go to Nikos’s Taverna, by which time – I had lost track – it was New Year’s Eve, and there he was – Carfilhiot, as I must call him here, with a young nerd called Alfredo who was well on the way to oblivion already. I got a fantastic welcome from everyone. C. in particular but also Alexis and Nikos who I never expected to remember me. </p>
<p>And the best thing – no-one asked why, when, whatever. I was just accepted. And I’m living with him now. Carfilhiot. It was a bit crowded when Alfredo was there, but he went three weeks ago. We’ve been talking about moving to a bigger place. </p>
<p>The funny thing is.. I’ve lost the need to blog. Blogging must have been some sort of sign I was miserable.</p>

Finished the rehab a couple of days ago. It was dire, but I don’t intend to go into that. At least I’m looking a bit better. They say I’m cured. I’m not so sure. I had a lot of time to think in the clinic and I realised that Amazon Harlequin is not for me. I kind of liked Damp Patch, but the only good thing about Amazon Harlequin was the money.&nbsp; Joe Goldman is still trying to put the band together, though Xaviera, who was in the clinic at the same time as me, seems like a broken reed now. She looks and talks like an unemployed lavatory cleaner. It’s pathetic, really. </p>
<p>I got my own lawyer, and we talked it over with Joe Goldman and his brief. Joe wasn’t exactly upset to see me resign. If the band never plays another note, Joe’ll die rich on the CD royalties. But he put up a show of resistance and there was a bit of haggling about the money, but at the end of the day I won’t have to work for a few years, though I’ll never get a cut of the royalties to which I was never really entitled. Fair enough. </p>
<p>The best news of all is that Martin has “copped a plea” as the expression goes, and I won’t even have to give evidence. So, I’m free at last. I think I’ll leave the country as soon as I can pull myself together.</p>

Well this is the first serious entry here for some time and my head is clear I think for the first time since July. Due to having been banged up in the nick for the last day and night. So it’s not all good. I looked in the mirror a few minutes ago and I look awful. I mean, skinny, and my face is all drawn and I look like an addict. </p>
<p>Of course, that’s exactly what I’ve been, even though I didn’t say so here before. </p>
<p>The thing is. Martin has turned this place into a drug supply warehouse.&nbsp; All the happy visitors were buyers. OK, Martin kept it exclusive, but it is a crime to supply class A drugs after all, and I can’t pretend I didn’t know what was going on. I just trusted Martin and the janitors to keep it discreet, which they did pretty well at. In return I got what I wanted. Thank God I was satisfied with just a little. I imagine it could have been worse. I saw such sights among the punters who turned up here. </p>
<p>In any case, it all came to an end when the cops rolled up and searched the place and arrested me and Martin and a couple of customers. You may already have seen it in the papers. It looked pretty bad for me, but Joe Goldman got me a good brief, and, in exchange for ratting out Martin, which didn’t hurt at all, I wasn’t charged.&nbsp; I also have to move out of the apartment, of course, and go into rehab. </p>
<p>Just so everyone knows, I feel pretty low.</p>

You may well ask. I seem to be high on something or other the whole time, but what the hell. No more news about the band yet. Chrysilla was here yesterday and she doesn’t know anything either which is a bit disappointing. As usual, the flat was full of Martin’s friends who I don’t know and it was hard to talk with them bothering Chrys. They stopped bothering me ages ago.</p>

Looks like Amazon Harlequin are going to get together again. Xaviera’s a lot better. My apartment has turned out to be a sort of club for everyone associated with the band.&nbsp; They’re dropping in at all times of day and night. There’s a guy, Martin, that’s set himself up as a sort of gatekeeper, and organises with the janitor downstairs who can come up and who can’t. At least it keeps the peoples’ paws off me when they get a bit OTT. I’ve got a bit of a reputation as frigid now, thank god. OK. There’s been a few complaints about the noise, but what the hell, we try to keep the CD player toned down at night.&nbsp; After all, these apartments are supposed to be sound-proof anyway. It’s a really happy atmosphere and everything. Can’t remember why I started this post. Bye bye.</p>

We’re supposed to be at some gig in Warwickshire or something tomorrow,&nbsp; but of course it won’t happen, will it. I know it’s ages since I posted. I’ll tell you why. </p>
<p>We started the tour more than 2 months ago. It seems like a year or two, and I only clearly remember the first concert. We sucked, in my opinion, but everyone was telling us how good we were and I think the others believed it. But they were wrong. We sucked, all right, and though the audience were yelling so loud, singing along the way they do, and attacking each other and everything, so they barely noticed, we even got a few boos on the night. And that was in Hicksville, Derbyshire. I confess that I was so nervous that I’d drunk most of a bottle of vodka over the course of the day, but it didn’t hit me till it was all over, so I don’t think it was my fault. Anyway, I think I drank less than the others. At the time, feeling high seemed great for the music. </p>
<p>By the end of the first week, the music press and the Sundays were slagging us off, not for our material, but the performance. The CD was and is still selling well, but of course I’m not on that.&nbsp; The techies made lots of changes to all the electronics. Some changes helped. Most didn’t. There was this fabulous stage and fantastic production and fireworks and&nbsp; bangs and lasers and everything, but the music was crap. </p>
<p>I didn’t really blame myself. Despite maintaining the pre-concert dose of alcohol, I thought I was doing a pretty good job, but Xaviera had it in for me and kept telling everyone I shouldn’t of been taken on. But really it was her vocals at fault. Out of tune at a rock concert is kind of excusable, but off the beat is a no-no. It looked like she’d lost her sense of rhythm. In fact, it turns out she was on crack and thought she could do better than the beat the rest of us were setting. Joe Goldman started insisting we did extra rehearsals and run-throughs, which was sheer torture because we were exhausted and pissed most of the time. And nobody tried. Then Joe banned the alcohol, which was worse, for a while, until Chrysilla got hold of some pills that were fantastic from one of the riggers – they can get anything, I find. The music actually started to sound a lot better, and we went on in a sort of&nbsp; spaced-out haze, until Xaviera collapsed on stage the other night – Leeds, as it turned out. We did two gigs without her – absolute rubbish – and then the tour was cancelled. </p>
<p>So here I am, back in my Docklands apartment. I can’t tell you what a relief it is. I think my life stopped during the tour. Hotels, minders (some of whom had dishonourable intentions), buses, planes, no control. Now I’m at a loose end. Got to go out.</p>

What a depressing little weed I looked in that last entry. </p>
<p>Anyway, the lonely bit didn’t last long because Dave turned up. My sweet sister gave him the address. I was so miserable I was almost pleased to see him, but I was worried about being alone with him so we went out to a restaurant. I bought. Oh, yes, bit of a rich bitch these days. Dave was very well behaved, for Dave, but he was a bit of a pain all the same, whining on about how I was avoiding him and dissing him in my blog. </p>
<p>I had no trouble scraping him off when we got back to the apartment. We have a 24-hour concierge service here, and I said goodbye right in front of the security guard. After he left, I said to the guard that I wouldn’t be in to Dave in future. He snapshotted Dave’s CCTV image, printed it, stuck it on a paper and stored it under the desk. Very efficient. Apparently, Dave arrived again this evening and the guard told him I was out. Are you reading this, Dave? I’m out, OK?</p>

We’ve been given a week off before the tour, and I needed the rest. I was getting really frazzled with the rehearsals so what the tour will be like I hate to think. I went home and was welcomed like a dose of flu. Only Mum spoke to me and that was only because she had plenty to criticise. So I’m back in my new apartment, surfing, listening to music and feeling well lonely really. For some reason, I feel I’ve let the guys in Damp Patch down, and I don’t feel good about contacting them. Sophie No-Mates, that’s me.</p>

Well, they seem to have sorted out the stage, lighting and sound. We did a dress rehearsal today in the warehouse. God knows what the locals on the industrial estate made of the deafening noise, and that was just the fireworks. To me, the band sounded awful, but Joe says that’s down to the warehouse which echoes very badly, and you need a full audience to provide a sort of sound baffle. I guess I already knew that, but I still think we sounded terrible. Not long till the first concert now. The first two are open air, then there’s the one in Liverpool which I’m not sure about. </p>
<p>Went to a party with Heloise last night. There were an awful lot of drugs there, but no-one offered me any, I’m relieved to say. I’ve had the odd puff at a Jamaican cigarette, but it never did anything for me. I’m not sure about Heloise.&nbsp; I had too much to drink, and danced until I nearly dropped, but she was out of it altogether and I took her back to my apartment in a taxi, fending off a dozen male chancers who wanted to come along, too. It was fun, though. It’s a change for me to get so much attention from the opposite sex!</p>

Great excitement today. The road gang were doing practice stage builds in the Rehearsal Studio today, which is just a big warehouse. What a mess. The first build took them four hours and still it was wrong. There’s meant to be all lasers and pyros and lighting and controllers and stuff strapped to this pile of scaffolding, and it’s got to go together like clockwork in about an hour. So they stripped it down and wheeled it all out into the trucks and did it again – two hours – big improvement, except that the wiring harness was all wrong because the lights didn’t work properly. We got no performance time today and when I left they were about to pull it all down and have a third try. There are some fit lads in the crew, I must say, but they’re cheeky buggers.</p>

I guess I was supposed to know that Pandora, who I am replacing, had overdosed and died, but I didn’t. It led to an embarrassing scene yesterday when I asked what must have seemed a bit of an insensitive question about her during a break. </p>
<p>She was Chrysilla’s special friend and she found Pandora’s body, so there were tears yesterday. Apparently some cranks have been connecting the suicide to the depressing Jonestown stuff on the Exotika CD, and there have even been rumours that fans have been offing themselves to the music, so the band don’t play these ones any more. Actually I thought they were quite good, but Exotika is only 3 tracks, each about 25 minutes, which is well unusual, and would be wrong for a live gig. </p>
<p>Now I’m into the music a bit, it’s less hectic. Nothing complicated in the chord sequences, lots of opportunities for clever bass runs if I’m quick. The rehearsals have been a bit boring for the other girls because they know most of the stuff I’m learning.&nbsp; I’ve got all four albums on my (new) iPod, and listen to them all the time, even the Jonestown ones.</p>

				<p>I just cannot believe the difference of working for a band like Amazon Harlequin compared with Damp Patch. I don’t live at home any more. Joe Goldman, the manager, moved me into a Docklands apartment they rented for the last bassist, who left suddenly. What’s fantastically (did I say hysterically) amusing is that the apartment is in one of the blocks where Peter and I did some plumbing maintenance just a few months ago!</p>
<p>When I borrowed Joe’s laptop the other day, he asked me what I really wanted, and I said a laptop of my own and a broadband connection – no sooner said, both arrived today.&nbsp; What is that? 3 days ago. Mind you, I’m working my butt off and I haven’t seen much of my lonely bed yet. The first tour date is less than 3 weeks away, and I’ve got to know all the favourites from four albums, plus all the new stuff&nbsp; Karina and Xaviera haven’t finished with yet, before then. Karina and Xaviera aren’t their real names, though they call each other Rina and Chav, I’m called Melita, Mel for short. One of the penalties is I’m going to have to wear some weird gear on stage and (laugh your socks off, Sister Suzanne) a blonde wig!</p>
<p>But, God, the money and the no expense spared. I cannot believe it. And the other girls are nice, and encouraging. Chav says I’m as good as Pandora, the girl I’m replacing, already. Then there’s all the technicians and Joe and the publicists and I haven’t met the haircare and make-up crew or the stage hands and roadies yet but there seems to be hundreds of them.</p>
<p>Oops, there goes the doorbell – [mode=posh] that’s my DRIVER come to take me to the REHEARSAL STUDIO in the MERCEDES.[/mode]</p>

				<p>This came as a huge surprise to me , and I guess it will to you, too. I’ll cut to the chase. I am now a member of Amazon Harlequin – don’t tell me you haven’t heard of them! <a href="http://www.amazonhq.co.uk/">Their Website</a></p>
<p>This is how it happened. Benedict came to me – it would be last Wednesday or Thursday – and asked if I’d be prepared to consider changing bands. I was really upset at first, I kind of flared up at him, after all the work I’ve done for Damp Patch. But when I came down he said he’d been approached by the manager of an important all-girl band with recording contracts who’d lost their bass player just a month before the beginning of a tour and needed an urgent replacement. The sweetener was a sum of money for Damp Patch that was so large he couldn’t just refuse out of hand. There was also a huge bag of gold for me if I took the job and stuck it out for the whole tour – three months. I would also get a share, obviously, of the tour proceeds, and if it worked out there would be a place in the all-girl band for me and if not I could come back to Damp Patch. So, he was asking me if I was up for it before he gave them an answer. I guessed about halfway through his spiel that it was Amazon Harlequin and I didn’t keep him waiting. </p>
<p>Anyway, it’s not at all the same thing as being with Damp Patch and when I get a minute I’ll go into more detail, but I’m in Leicester using Joe’s laptop on a dial-up and it’s so slow I’m going mad here and I’m too busy learning yet another play list to waste any time. It’s just I had to tell someone.&nbsp;</p>

Dave, if you’re reading this, and I suspect you are, please leave me alone, or I’ll call the police. </p>
<p>I got home after the disastrous Durham expedition to find Dave camped on Mum’s doorstep. He tried to talk to me but I just brushed past. I have no intention of speaking to you, Dave. </p>
<p>And so to Damp Patch. Two gigs this week, and we seem to actually have fans who turn up repeatedly to different performances. We are getting more adventurous, too.&nbsp; We are still using 60s songs but we’re putting more individual treatments on them.&nbsp; It really is working very well for us, and we’re getting so many gigs now that Benedict is actually having to manage the diary. Mostly London, happily, but we’re now at Reading and Glastonbury this year. Wow!</p>

				<p>Don’t ask how my trip to Newcastle and Durham went. Well, the gig was OK, and Jez dropped me off in Durham at some ridiculously late hour on Sat night – Sunday morning. I guess it was stupid of me to think that just booking a hotel for Saturday night entitled me to enter my room at 2 in the morning. Boy, did they give me a hard time, and I guess I wasn’t very sober or well-dressed either. Then I missed breakfast because I slept in. So I started with a bit of a thing against Durham. It’s pretty enough, but I learned nothing, and the trip was a total waste of time and expense. Did I expect the Archaeology Dept. to be open? I guess I did, but it wasn’t.</p>
<p>It took me most of the rest of yesterday to get back to civilization.&nbsp; I’m not sure I want that job. And to cap it all, I got an earful from Mum because Dave’s been pestering her to death.</p>

Well, that was a big mistake, standing Dave up. He came round this morning, whining and complaining.&nbsp; He hasn’t actually done anything, but he looks kind of dangerous.&nbsp; He’s different from how he was before.&nbsp; Then, he was a bit of a drunken lout, but quite intelligent. Now, he looks like there’s a screw loose in his brain or something. I don’t know how to handle the situation, so I’m crashing out on someone’s floor for a few days in the hope he loses interest. </p>
<p>Also, I’m in the doghouse about my blog again. Remember I did an entry about Cousin Will being picked up for drugs, and how the whole family pretended to think he was innocent?&nbsp; Well, he was convicted at his trial, he’s being banged up for 4 years, and his lawyer just happened to mention that my blog didn’t exactly help his case. Right. The judge reads my blog, does he?&nbsp; I don’t think so. But the family do, so I’m in disgrace.</p>

Transport’s a lot easier now that I keep my practice amp at home and the performance kit with the band. All I have to do is turn up with the guitar. But this week we’ve got a gig in Newcastle, so I thought I’d stop off in Durham and have a look at the Uni where I’m supposed to be going for my interview, which is soon. </p>
<p>I don’t believe it, but Dave turned up at home yesterday, just rang the bell and asked me out. I said no, but he hung around in a creepy sort of way, even after I closed the door on him. When I went out half an hour later, he ran up and moaned on about how much he missed me and how sorry he was and everything, I was nearly screaming because I couldn’t get rid of him. I finally agreed to meet him at the Long Acre pub tomorrow, but only to keep him quiet. I won’t actually go, because we’ve got a band practice. </p>
<p>Then I fell asleep on the Tube again.&nbsp; I must look like some kind of alcoholic dosser.</p>

It’s getting harder and harder work.&nbsp; We seem to be getting gigs now faster than we can do them.&nbsp; I spend all my spare time – that’s about 20 hours a day – practicing with earphones on. We’re learning new material all the time. Benedict was saying he thinks I’m the reason the band turned the corner.&nbsp; If so, I’m delighted, but it puts even more pressure on me. </p>
<p>I find myself dozing off in all sorts of places – on a tube today, I finished up at Totteridge and Whetstone, wherever that is. I didn’t stop to find out, just nipped over the bridge and came back to civilisation. Last week I spent a couple of hours slumped over a coffee in Leadenhall Market. And I haven’t seen anything on tv since God knows when.&nbsp; I sit down in front of the box and that’s it till Mum wakes me up to go to bed. But I’ve always got the energy for playing.</p>

Two gigs and a practice session since the last entry. My new kit is a big success – it really improves my play. The only danger is that I’m tending to be a bit loud these days. </p>
<p>Best piece of gossip, though. Jon defied his new wife and did both gigs and the practice. On the second gig, he arrived with a spectacular scratch right down his cheek. “Had an argument with his mother’s cat”, apparently. Then Mrs Jon arrived at the practice this afternoon and attacked him. Everybody laughed, except me. Jon eventually had to pack up and go home. All very embarrassing. I think that marriage is headed for the rocks. </p>
<p>Peter has taken on another “apprentice”, so I guess that’s me written out of the script. Never mind. The experience will come in useful. What man could resist a woman who can change a ballcock?</p>

A very quick entry just to say I haven’t given up the blog, although entries are reduced to a trickle. I’m still persona non grata at the Peter front, and I haven’t dared go up to college in case I meet Dave. But here is why I’m blogging today.&nbsp; In this morning’s post came an interview from Durham Uni for a job starting next September – 4 months for heaven’s sake! But at least it’s a proper archaeology job and it’s absolute miles from here, which would be nice for me in the current circumstances, except for the band of course. </p>
<p>Another gig tomorrow, and we’re toiling a bit on this one because Jon’s new wife is already cutting up rough about the amount of time he’s spending with the band and tomorrow’s her birthday and he’s GOT TO TAKE HER OUT! Women! No sense of proportion. I can see why we get such a bad name.</p>

				<p>I’m being sucked in to Damp Patch, and I’m very glad of it.&nbsp; They and my Mum seem to be the only people who don’t mind about the blog and the blog is pretty important to me.&nbsp; But the strange thing is that Damp Patch now assume I’m in the band on a permanent basis and I’m not complaining because it gives me an outlet. </p>
<p>With Jon back in the band, we were short of an amp for the bass, so, with Jon and Jez holding my hand, I went and blew nearly 200 quid on a second-hand 100 watt bass amplifier with 4 10 inch speakers, but I’m keeping my old 25W amp for practice at home. And a mere 60 pounds on eBay for a Squier Bass Guitar of my very own. With this, I should be able to blast everyone else off the stage, should I care to!&nbsp; Anyway, it’s only money, and they’ll resell for not much less if I give it all up. </p>
<p>Jez remembered that I used to sing Chaka Khan’s “Ain’t Nobody” , and Benedict thought it’d be a good one to give him a rest in the middle of a set, so off we went at this last rehearsal. And of course it’s got a great bass line. Andy played the keyboard part much better than we used to at school, and it really went very well. I was totally done in by the time we’d done it five times, mostly because Hambone couldn’t get the beat right – it’s sort of a hiccupy beat and the song doesn’t work with a straight thump, thump. </p>
<p>All this retro rock sounds like it’s for Mum and Dad, but I think we do it in a distinctive way that’s not trying to copy the original – we’re just using tried and tested songs and playing them our way. I think some bands these days who are quite good really fall down because they are crap at song writing or they’ve got some anarchy message they’re trying to plug through the lyrics. The gig in Sheffield was full of that kind of stuff. </p>
<p>So, anyway, a string of gigs lined up over the next few weeks at London places (including one at Underworld in Camden – v. upmarket), I’m really getting into this.</p>

Well, most of the fuss has died down. Peter is never going to forgive me, and I’m sorry, actually, Peter, because you were very kind to me giving me a job and training me up and everything. Similarly Dave, who did wangle me that trip to Greece for which thank you, Dave. </p>
<p>Mum seems to have rationalised it, and everyone else is just making jokes about it. I’ve had dozens of emails from folk I hardly know, asking me to diss them in my blog! </p>
<p>I’ve spent the week in the Public Library, combing the newspapers and writing application letters for every single job with the word “Archaeology” in it, wherever located. It’s mostly University jobs, recycling what I’ve learned and Museums, which is a little more interesting. I’d really like to do site work, like I did in Greece, but it’s very badly paid. Plumbing has spoiled me for low paid jobs. </p>
<p>Speaking of low paid jobs, I went to another Damp Patch rehearsal. Jon, the bass player I replaced, is still on his honeymoon, but they’re talking now about letting Jon go back to second lead guitar and making me a permanent bass player. The drummer, Hambone (don’t ask), moaned that it would reduce the money they each got for a gig, but Jez pointed out that “80% of piss-all is still piss-all”. Everyone but me has a permanent job. The money for the gigs doesn’t even cover running the van.</p>

I found out today who told everyone about my blog. It was Nikki. I wondered why my own little sister could have dropped me in it like that, but of course she and I had this terrible row when I got back from Greece because she’d nicked all my CDs from my room while I was away and I haven’t even got most of them back even yet. </p>
<p>It was Suzanne who told me Nikki had been boasting a couple of months ago that she had found my ‘diary’ and it was full of ‘stuff’. </p>
<p>When I challenged Nikki about it, she admitted contacting everyone mentioned in the blog, and giving them the URL. She even went to the length of persuading Joe Mason to get a notice put up at University, which I have since ripped up, but too late. Thank you, Joe, and, by the way, Nikki is too young and immature for you. </p>
<p>Well, Nikki, if you’re reading this, and I bet you are, here’s a little ‘stuff’ for all your friends. </p>
<p>Nikki, at the age of 17, still goes to bed with a disgusting furry bag, which used to be a teddy bear, and sucks it all night. All attempts to take it from her, for laundry purposes, for example, result in a peevish tantrum accompanied by tears. </p>
<p>That should totally improve your street cred, Nikki, what do you think? </p>
<p>And if I don’t get my CDs back real soon, further, juicier, revelations about your private life will follow, so stay tuned, folks.</p>
<p>Well, I’m glad I got that one off my chest.</p>

Is there anyone I know that I haven’t upset with my blog? Don’t worry, just send me an email, and I’ll make sure to insult you too. </p>
<p>I am NOT going to take my blog down. I an NOT going to edit it to please everyone. I am NOT going to attempt to hide anyone’s identity in future. </p>
<p>And I AM thoroughly pissed off with someone. That someone knows me, my family and my Uni friends, so there’s not many suspects. I’ll find out who you are, and give you a hard time. </p>
<p>In short, Whoever It Was printed off my blog and made sure my family and friends got copies of it. Peter is particularly angry because his bit on the side has been choked off. He’s told me not to bother coming in to work. </p>
<p>Even people I’ve been quite nice about. Mum went ballistic. Suzanne says she feels “used”. Used? How? </p>
<p>Dave…&nbsp; Well, I can see how Dave’d be upset. I haven’t exactly pulled my punches about him. He is speechless with rage, and I’ve stopped going in to the Arch. Dept. for fear of reprisals. Well, that’s too bad. I know you’re reading this, Dave, so just get over it.</p>

				<p>I even got paid for the gig. It wasn’t as much as the money I lost by missing several nightshifts as a plumber, as my mother immediately pointed out. I didn’t really expect any praise for my fifteen minutes of fame, but what with my brother G. dissing Damp Patch as “totally f-ing lame”, Mum wittering about loss of earnings and the dangers of a showbiz life, and Suzanne insisting I need a major makeover before I dare to step on a stage again – Miaow – I’m thoroughly switched off on the family front.</p>

				<p>Well, that was fantastically exciting! It’s all over, and I think I got away with it! I just practiced non-stop for a week. I drove P mad snatching every spare moment to practice. Three band rehearsals and a ropy CD of all the stuff DP intended to perform that I took home and just played along with until I knew Jon’s riffs by heart, and even improved on them in places, so by the last session before we headed North, I was fine. Also because everything they do is classic material, I was even up to speed on the words of choruses very quickly.</p>
<p>The other complication was what to wear. Benedict wanted me in something floaty and cocktail-party, but it’s not my style. In the end I got this real power business woman suit out of Oxfam for twenty quid – black classic-looking jacket and shortish skirt – that I wore with a white blouse, high heels and everything. It seemed to go down very well, even with Benedict.</p>
<p>As the junior support band, we were up first. I really enjoyed it, I got a fantastic buzz from the live audience. We did the set at a terrific pace, faster than the rehearsals – somehow the pressure of the occasion required it. We got a great cheer and applause at the end, and we stayed to see all the other bands. Fantastic night! I’m too tired to go on right now. But all the guys were really nice about my playing and Jez said they might call on me again!</p>

				<p>Jez from Damp Patch actually called me last night! He talked around the houses for a while and then asked whether I still played bass guitar. Of course, I haven’t even got one, so I said, “What’s all this about, anyway?”</p>
<p>Then he came out with it that they’ve got a gig at The Leadmill in Sheffield and the bass player, Jon, can’t make it because he’s getting married which Benedict apparently forgot when the offer (a substitution for another band) came through even though Damp Patch was supposed to be at Jon’s wedding. But a gig at The Leadmill is not to be missed anyway, so did I think I could play in…</p>
<p>I don’t kid myself I was his first choice, but, dammit, it’s really exciting to be asked. I said yes, but I’d need a bass guitar and some rehearsals, which was obvious and here I go. Of course I haven’t completely forgotten how to play, because it’s only a few years and I still play my acoustic guitar sometimes.</p>

				<p>Back from Greece and such a lot has happened. Well, the dig was a lot more interesting than I expected. The photographs and plans didn’t do it justice really. Anyway all that’s for a separate report I’m writing in my spare time, haha what spare time?</p>
<p>While we were in Greece, one day, D started drinking at lunchtime and carried on till we were all in this taverna in the evening and he was totally out of control and aggressive with it. I forget what the argument was about, but it was so loud that this Brit from another table, an older guy, asked us to keep it down. Anyway D started to give this guy a hard time, then Phil started and D smacked him.&nbsp; Phil kind of swiped back at him and the next thing it’s a brawl with this Brit helping to try and restrain D and I caught an elbow in the chest where it hurts and I was so furious I just picked up a bottle and hit D with it. He turned at the wrong moment and it caught him across the nose and broke it, the nose not the bottle, and he just keeled over on the floor.</p>
<p>By this time the Old Bill were on their way, and I don’t know why but when the Brit went back to his table,&nbsp; I just went across and sat with him. I was shaking a bit at what I’d done to D. He was very nice. He told me his name was Carfilhiot.&nbsp; I later found out it wasn’t his real name but that’s what I call him. I sought him out the next evening in the taverna. He invited me home with him because he lives on the island and I felt safer with him than staying at the hotel with Dave and the others so I went. He has a motor bike.</p>
<p>At first I had the impression he was middle-aged, but he’s not that old. We got on so well, I can’t tell you, and I was quite attracted to him but he was a perfect gentleman that way and we never even kissed although I spent most of the rest of the week sleeping at his house to stay out of D’s way.</p>
<p>He looks a bit like Richard Dreyfuss looked when he was in Jaws – not very athletic but very quick talking, clever and excitable. And kind of gullible in an innocent way, trusting. I loved him to bits. I told him all my life story and he told me his, which was a lot more exciting I promise you.</p>
<p>It was a bit disappointing when he just took me back to the others on the last day and just said goodbye without offering to phone or write. Still, holiday romances, what did I expect? Something a bit more like a romance I suppose!</p>
<p>Never mind, I enjoyed the whole fortnight a lot, so why am I complaining?</p>

				<p>The Damp Patch gig was very good. Jez had given me two tickets, but, being Sophie No-Mates, I couldn’t find anyone I wanted to go with. I finally gave the other ticket to V, but we went separately, and I never saw her on the night. Damp Patch weren’t top of the bill, just one of the supporting bands. And they’re quite conservative, if that’s the word to use. The featured band was Dollis Hill Loop whatever that’s supposed to mean, and I don’t suppose they want the crowd all moshed out before they get to their spot. What Damp Patch did was dig up old numbers by 70s and 80s bands and give them a modern sound. So they did Roxy Music’s Jealous Guy – and Robert Palmer’s Simply Irresistible –&nbsp; Benedict, the lead singer, doesn’t play anything now (he used to do rhythm guitar). Everyone dresses in a business suit on stage, so it fits well in that kind of song, and he did Eurythmics’ You Have Placed A Chill In My Heart which is unusual having a man singing it and Hanging on the Telephone which was a Blondie track. They must have done about six numbers in a half hour and the crowd liked them all. I think it’s a bit of a problem doing old standards like that because people are comparing you to the original, but I have to say their treatment was fresh enough so you didn’t really notice. It gave me a tingle to see Benedict and Jez all grown up. They had a keyboard player I didn’t recognise, a drummer who liked the tom toms a lot, and a pretty good bass guitarist.</p>
<p>I didn’t really take to Dollis Hill Loop. They don’t seem to know what they want, but all their songs are their own as far as I can see, so maybe you have to get into them. Afterwards, I went backstage to see Jez (he gave me a pass when he gave me the tickets). It was all very jolly and alcoholic and the whole evening was well worth missing a plumbing shift for.&nbsp; Jez introduced me as a hot bassist, which I never was, and nearly everyone was very nice to me, even Benedict, who turned out to have a BOYFRIEND. Shock! Horror! I’d never suspected at school, but you don’t, do you? At first, I got some icy glares from Jez’s current girl, but she calmed down after a while when she saw I wasn’t a rival.</p>
<p>Anyway, I go to Greece on Saturday, so I don’t suppose you’ll hear from me until I get back in a fortnight (16 April).</p>

				<p>Had an unexpected encounter this afternoon. Jez (no point in hiding his name ‘cos he’s famous) tapped me on the shoulder in Boots where I was hunting for a shower cap (not for the shower but for protecting my hair during wet and dirty plumbing jobs). Jez is lead guitarist in Damp Patch, an up and coming band. When I knew him for years back we were playing together in a schoolkids’ band called Deaf Shepherd. At the time I fancied myself as a lead guitarist but I never really had the talent compared with Jez. So I finished up playing a pretty lively (borrowed) bass guitar for Deaf Shepherd. I was always being told to stop trying to play the melody and just do the rhythm. We rehearsed for about six months, then had one or two gigs, and the band fell apart.</p>
<p>It wasn’t till last year that I heard Jez and the singer, Benedict, had formed Damp Patch, and seemed to be doing all right as a warm-up band for more important names, but I never heard them play. I wondered where the songs were coming from, because the keyboard guy from Deaf Shepherd had always written the songs. He was part of the reason we broke up because he was never happy with the rest of us and fancied he could do better. I haven’t heard of him since.</p>
<p>Anyway, Jez was quite complimentary about my bass as he remembered it. I said I felt a bit embarrassed I’d never heard Damp Patch play, and he gave me a couple of tickets for a concert next Tuesday. Result!</p>

				<p>A very busy weekend, but nothing much of interest. P. seems to have spent so much time watching rugby on tv lately that he can’t keep his eyes open at work.&nbsp; On Sunday, he started to switch on&nbsp; a radiator that he hadn’t tightened up yet. It was a good job I was there because I stopped him before he got dirty water all over the floor. That’s something I wonder about. Why is radiator water so filthy, even when it’s only just been filled? I’m not talking about the Fernox stuff – it happens even before the Fernox goes in – it must be that they don’t wash out radiators when they are first made.</p>

				<p>I reminded P last night that I was going on this Greek trip for most of next month. He was OK about it, but I was quite pleased to see that he looked a little concerned. I don’t know if it’s because he’s losing his tame loo clearance operative, or he’s going to find it harder to hoodwink his other half, but in either event, he seemed disappointed.</p>

				<p>A rather disastrous date with D last night. It started just the same way as usual, but in the pub he started to drink pretty hard. When it came time for me to go to work, he tried to persuade me to stay, then when I left by myself, he ran after me and grabbed me. I was very alarmed, and I sort of froze. He saw my face and he tried to laugh it off and even called me a taxi.</p>
<p>I’m only having anything to do with him in case he screws up the Greek trip for me. When it’s over, he’s history.. or archaeology.&nbsp; ie dead and buried!</p>

				<p>I’m really slow. I just sussed that P is now using me as his alibi when he spends time with his other girlfriend. I wondered why he often gave me his mobile phone when he left me to get on with some repair I could handle. More than once, I’ve had to tell M, when she rang up, that he was on another job. He was on the job, all right. Of course, wherever he leaves me, I’ve got to hang around until he comes back with the van, so it’s sometimes a bit awkward hanging around waiting for him, though he’s always come back exactly when he said he would.</p>
<p>How did I find out about this? Not by doing a Sherlock Holmes. Turns out that this business is all in the family. R told me P’s extracurricular interest is J, his own brother H’s wife. And H is on the cross-channel ferries, so he’s away two weeks in three.</p>
<p>Well, it’s nothing to do with me, but I’m seeing friendly old P in a new light. And I hate that he’s got me involved without the option.</p>

				<p>Another date with D. I’m beginning to dread them. He seems OK, really, and I’m keeping him sweet because I don’t want any hassle about the Greek trip but I certainly don’t fancy him and it’s a question of looking kind of available without actually being. We meet at the Uni, look at whatever’s new about the trip, then eat, still Dutch, then a drink (or a few in his case), then he takes me home. He’s had a couple of goes at getting me back to his flat, but it’s in Finchley and he shares, so it’s not really practical, thank God. Especially because I usually tell him I’m working on the overnight shift, even if I’m not. I’ve asked him in for a cuppa, but he always refuses. I’ve got a feeling that he carries on drinking after he delivers me.</p>

				<p>P lets me do quite a few jobs by myself these days. I’ve become really expert with the loo plunger. P says I’m better than he is at it, but I think it’s because he doesn’t really like these blocked loo jobs. Frankly, if it wasn’t for the money I’d run a mile, but it pays really well.</p>
<p>We spent nearly the whole weekend in a new block of apartments behind the Commercial Road, just tightening up all the loose radiator connections and leaky pipes before they put the carpets in. Whoever did the original plumbing contract wanted shooting, according to P. In truth, considering there were about 200 apartments in the block, we didn’t find many actual faults, but as P says, there shouldn’t have been any. A leak from a 20p junction can ruin a grand’s worth of carpet.</p>
<p>Terrific views from the top floors of the block, across the river, toy boats, toy streets full of toy traffic, old churches standing in little patches of green among all the concrete and tarmac. I think it was the first time I’d ever been that high with the opportunity to spend time looking out the window. P showed me where our house is, but there was too much concrete between to see the actual building, though I could see the top of the old factory in the next street.</p>
<p>Less than a month to go to the trip. That’s what I’m looking forward to now.</p>

				<p>We’ve been studying a huge catalogue of very poor photos of the site we’ll be excavating in April. Also another catalogue of black and white photos of some of the earlier finds – pots and metal tools and jewellery etc. It’s almost impossible to make out what most of them are. But what’s clear is that they are from all sorts of periods. It looks as though this site is a total mish mash of settlements all on top of each other. Well that’s not uncommon, but there’s usually a more obvious reason for a site to stay popular for centuries, like being a deep-water port, on a trade route, at a sacred site or something. But this place is miles from the sea, off the beaten track and there’s no sign yet of a temple or statuary – just the foundations of houses and a street, and some huge blocks of stone as if there was a plan to build something.</p>

				<p>I used to be brainwashed into thinking that family was the only important thing in life, and I have to say that many of my relatives think so, or appear to think so. And that seems to&nbsp; be why, despite all evidence to the contrary, everyone is up in arms about cousin W’s arrest on drugs. To me, it was just SO obvious he was on drugs and in the trade. Why can’t anyone else see it? I mean, he has the brand new BMW, he has the real Rolex watch (who has a real Rolex these days?), the gold rings and chains and the suits and the silk shirts and the roll of 50 pound notes. Also, he’s been totally spaced out for the past year – you can’t tell what colour his eyes are because the pupils are totally huge. And why isn’t he supposed to be guilty, according to the Campbell’s? Because he was stopped and searched when he ran into the back of a patrol car and broke its rear light and they found a vast amount of C under his passenger seat. Apparently, you’re not guilty if they search you for the wrong reasons. How dumb is that? The current story is that the police planted the drugs on him. Right. Only why would the police bother to cart two huge packs of cocaine around on patrol in the hope of tricking some druggy into ramming them when a fraction of that amount would prove he was supplying? Now, I used to quite like W, until he got too obviously weird on his merchandise. But now I’m being pressurised to stand up for him. It’s ridiculous. And I got into such a fight last night about my “disloyalty” to the sacred family. I can’t wait to get out of this madhouse we call home. Not much chance of that, though, seeing as how I’m still not paying rent, because I’m saving up for Greece.</p>

				<p>Went out with D again last night. When I get home, Mum said “You’re late.” </p>
<p>I said, “But I’m later than this every night.” </p>
<p>“It’s different when you’re working. I hope you’re still a virgin.” </p>
<p>Where did that come from? I wondered. Then realised it was all about P’s spot of bother with M. I just glared at her. A catholic priest once told me that a lot of nuns were in the convent because they’d tried sex and didn’t like it much. On this basis I’d qualify for a nunnery. I have no difficulty telling Mum I’m a virgin. I’m not, but I might as well be. D has other ideas, though.</p>

We had a nice briefing today on the ruins we’ll be looking at in Greece. </p>
<p>As far as I can gather, there is no building projecting more than about three inches from the ground, the whole area has been thoroughly turned over years ago for its pots and jewellery, and the turning over has confused the site.The finds were dated at between 100BC and 1000BC, which makes them really uninteresting. </p>
<p>There are no Mycenaean or Minoan or Hellenic connections, so what we have here is a settlement of common folk, no kings, no palaces, no exotic religions involving blood sacrifices. All the nice pottery and jewellery has already been carted off to a museum. Still, beggars can’t be choosers, and I’m a beggar these days.</p>

				<p>Back to normal, then, with the disfunctional plumbing of East London. Quite a relief to be encountering the same old problems. I’ve learned so much in the last month!</p>
<p>P, though, was looking pretty shifty last night. I finally wormed out of him that he is having an affair with some woman whose central heating he fitted last year, and M’s suspicions are well-founded. The smug bugger actually said he was pleased I’d been suspected and cleared by M, because it would lift the pressure off him. Turd.</p>

				<p>M called – P’s girlfriend – full of apology. The story? P had had a fling with some girl before Christmas and M thought it had all started up again. Apparently, P convinced her that he could never fancy me. Well, there’s a compliment, isn’t it? Anyway, it’s OK if I work with P. Well, thanks very much, Mandy.

				<p>If I thought my troubles were over for the week I was wrong. It was three o’clock in the morning and P and I are sitting in the all-night caff with all the taxi drivers and the early-shift underground workers when in walks P’s girlfriend, M, a nice girl I knew at school for heaven’s sake, and starts laying into us as if we were having an affair or something. I didn’t know where to look. Anyway, P took her outside, all the men in the place leering at me like I’m some kind of whore while he’s talking to her in full view of the window and she’s weeping like you wouldn’t believe. I didn’t know where to put myself. Then P walks off with her soaking his shoulder and I’m left there with a cup of sugary coffee and a sticky bun for twenty minutes till I left and walked right home. I haven’t heard from P since so I don’t even know if I’m working tonight and his mobile’s off. I am thoroughly sick.</p>

				<p>So D and I went out again last night. It was a repeat of last time at first. But when we went to the pub, there was one of his friends there – I&nbsp; forget his name. Well, I don’t know how it started, maybe the friend was too nice to me, but suddenly they were both on their feet glaring at each other. It really looked a bit dangerous for a minute. But then D’s friend backed off a little and it was all over. D came over all apologetic to me. But the friend went all pale and walked out. It was all very worrying, and I saw D in a new light altogether. I took a cab home. </p>
<p>Then this morning D calls me all butter wouldn’t melt, and goes “Let’s see a movie.” I made an excuse.</p>

				<p>Peter actually let me do a job all by myself last night. It wasn’t much really. Just one of those sink trap blockages, but we’d just arrived at the customer when he got a call to a burst pipe nearby so he left me there with a pipe wrench and some spanners and I fixed it and I caught up with him later. </p>
<p>He was nice enough to say that he gets through a lot more work with me helping than he used to on his own. And he has raised my pay! I’m saving as much as I can for this Greek trip.</p>

				<p>Well, D finally got his date last night. It was OK really, he didn’t force himself on me or anything but I can’t say I’m smitten or impressed in any way. I made sure I dressed tidily but not too alluring. We went to Carlotta’s and had spaghetti bolognese. I insisted on going Dutch, but he bought the wine, which was one of those tourist-trap Italian bottles with straw wrapped round it that taste like dishwater. I mostly drank water so he had most of it himself. Then we hit the Fancy Tart – a pub named after some admiral or other. We had a few drinks. We talked archaeology a bit which wasn’t too bad. It seems this dig in Greece is at any rate quite new and undocumented.Then he walked me home. By this time I’d made sure he knew I lived with my family, so there was no nonsense there. I quite enjoyed the evening because I haven’t been getting out much but I didn’t think he did.</p>
<p>So I was quite surprised when he txtd me this morning to say he’d enjoyed our date and we must do it again. Maybe he was just being polite, but he doesn’t seem that kind of person.</p>

				<p>No definite news about the trip to Greece yet, but D said today he was sure it’d be OK. Then he invited me out this Saturday. I’m working the midnight to eight shift with P, so I told him I had a night shift starting midnight. I didn’t tell him what my other job is. I’m not sure that’d be wise! It’s not a very feminine occupation, nor a particularly scholarly one. He gave me a strange look and didn’t suggest another alternative, so I hope I haven’t shot myself in the foot on this one. What if he finds someone else to wangle on the trip? But then I don’t really fancy this assignment being dependent on dating D.</p>
<p>I suddenly realised that I was going to use initials instead of names here, but I’ve mentioned Peter and Dave by name, and my own name’s real. So much for discretion. I’ll revert to P and D now, and revise the other entries some other time.</p>

				<p>One of these Docklands jobs in a stylish new apartment was worth a laugh. We were called in by this guy who had discovered that when he flushed his loo several times in succession, on the second flush the flushing water was warm, on the third it was hot, and on subsequent occasions it arrived steaming. I didn’t get it at first, any more than the punter, who had been in the brand-new flat for months without noticing, so it seemed to him that it had only just started to happen. Of course, Peter got it right away. The cistern was connected to the hot water system instead of the cold. It came in cold the first time because it had had time to cool before the next flush. If it had been in our house, it would have been boiling the whole time. The loo doesn’t feature much idle time at the Campbells.</p>
<p>Another problem at one of the new apartments in the same block was the mysterious stream of scalding water that shot from the overflow pipe of the central heating. This geyser could erupt at almost any time of day, and the pipe was directed into a little courtyard behind the flats. Everyone was terrified to cross the yard in case it was time for Old Faithful. Even the local cats avoided the place. It almost  stumped Peter, because everything seemed connected up OK. It turned out that the inlet and outlet pipes on the boiler had been reversed, and it was a miracle that it worked at all, which it seemed to mostly.</p>

				<p>Got a whisper of a job on an ancient site in the Greek islands this morning. Dave, one of my classmates from final year is going on it, and he says he’ll try to wangle a place on it for me. I’d never really noticed Dave before. He’s a big red-haired guy who I didn’t think I liked very much, but if he can get a job for me he’ll be my hero. Seems it’s been planned for ages but there have been a few drop-outs because it’s at an awkward time and it’s not a very interesting site. But, hey, any real archaeological work will do me, especially when it’s in the sunshine. Please let it work out! Some of the students in my class have had zero difficulty getting jobs. I wonder if it’s racial or sexual discrimination despite I got a better degree than most of them. No point in worrying about that, though, because I’ll never know. Dave seems to think that a beard is part of an archaologist’s uniform, so he’s growing one, he says. I don’t think I’ll bother. </p>

				<p>I’m beginning to recognise the various customer types that Peter services. There are the terribly poor ones who can hardly afford Peter’s rather expensive rates. They tend to be in the council flats and only call Peter when it becomes obvious that the  council are not going to turn up and make the repair for them. And when the situation is almost out of hand. Then there are the estate management  people, including, sometimes, the council themselves, who are looking after a building. They are usually spending someone else’s money, so they don’t care and they’ll call out Peter for a trivial job and pay the full callout fee and exorbitant hourly rate without a blink. Finally there are the well-off people in these Docklands developments, with fancy interior decor and what Peter calls ‘slick’ plumbing.</p>

				<p>It was a quieter night from the plumbing point of view and Peter and I spent a couple of hours sitting in his kitchen waiting for another call. When we’d talked about plumbing for a while,  he asked me about archaeology, that’s the second time he’s done that – and he’s the first member of my family to listen to the answer.  I think he was really interested. Then we got another call and it was madness again for an hour or two.</p>

				<p>Well. My first night shift over, and a few tales to tell already. I’d sort of expected to be sitting around half the night, waiting for a phone call, but it wasn’t like that at all. We must have answered a dozen calls. I’d always imagined that plumbing was all about fixing burst pipes, but there was only one of those.</p>
<p>In a filthy kitchen showing all the signs of a recent “domestic”, a sink had been pushed a good six inches out of place, and a mist of water sprayed out from the twisted joint under the tap. Peter found the supply valve and turned the water off. We wrestled the sink back into place and Peter fixed the connection.</p>
<p>There were two blocked toilets, utterly ghastly. What a stink, I tell you. Peter says they always leave it too long before calling him. He has a strange flexible plunger sort of thing that he rams down the loo. It worked both times last night, but Peter says it doesn’t always. He didn’t mention what he does if the plunger doesn’t work, but I hate to think.</p>
<p>In most cases it was a blocked sink and involved taking out the trap and clearing it. One of these was truly  silly – someone had poured jelly down the sink and it had set solid.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Peter is my cousin, I don’t really know him very well. He was very nice, explaining everything he was doing, and letting me pull the spanner from time to time. In between jobs, we talked a lot, and he seemed very interested in my archaeology, saying I should stick to my guns and not be bullied into some dead-end profession.</p>

				<p>I’ve been offered a job and it really is ideal because it allows me to have most of my day free for archaeological pursuits – at least those items that can be pursued in the college library. I remember my cousin Peter watching me on New Year’s Eve, when the whole family were on about me earning a living, and he was the only one who wasn’t on my case. He phoned up this morning and suggested that I take a job as his assistant. He would pay me a percentage of what he earns and I would just help him and learn the trade at the same time. He mainly works at night – he has a franchise as a 24 hour emergency plumber. This doesn’t mean that the job is 24 hours, you choose a shift, and you only get called during that time period. He takes the midnight to 8am shifts because he has his brother’s shop to look after. You can see there’s a tradition of hard work in our family and why it there is such pressure on everyone to get a job!</p>
<p>So, anyway, I start tomorrow, Monday.  A plumber!</p>

				<p>I suppose that I’d better fill in some background about me and my family. My great-grandmother came from Jamaica. She married an Irishman recently arrived from a famine-stricken Galway. At the time, they were both representatives of the underclass, but together they forged a dynasty of industrious workers. I am an exception, and Mum loses no opportunity to remind me.</p>
<p>The Campbell clan varies quite a bit in appearance. Some of my cousins are very dark, Peter in particular. I am almost white, but the mirror reminds me of my Carribean origin. Those lips. But at least my hair is reasonably long and straight and I don’t spend half my life in the hairdresser, steaming out kinks, plaiting them into cornrows and threading in beads and extensions. No wonder hairdressing is a growth industry in the East End of London, my sister and several other female relations being pillars of the profession.</p>
<p>I don’t really like the way I look. It’s been quite comfortable at University wearing jeans and baggy sweaters and I am confident that a professional archaeologist can spend most of their life wearing just that uniform.</p>
<p>Suzanne keeps trying to get me into make-up and posh frocks, and perch me on shoes of unlikely height, and I have to admit that she looks really good in all the war paint and finery, but I haven’t got the patience for all the effort.</p>
<p>So I’m not exactly under siege from boyfriends, and I think most of my relatives of my generation think I’m retarded – half of them are married or at least in a “meaningful” relationship by my age. 22 in case you’re wondering. I’ll post a photo up here next time I’m all dressed up for a party. Till then, you’ll have to use your overactive imaginations.</p>

				<p>Saying I’ve got a degree in Archaeology is a bit simplistic. There is so much in it.  I think that’s what excites me most. For my degree I did Archaeological Method, Bioarchaeology, Archaeological computing, Landscape Archaeology, Ancient History, Greek and Latin. It was such hard work, and at the end I had hardly started on anything real, just a few visits to British digs and holiday jobs doing pick and shovel stuff.</p>
<p>I graduated without a job to go to. Then before my month looking for Viking relics I skimmed through all the literature on Viking stuff in the department’s library and on the internet and visited the Brit Mus, and other museums, and still I knew nothing by the time I was scratching a trench in Sainsbury’s Car Park.</p>
<p>That’s what makes me so mad. The worry that I might have spent four years of my life learning a trade I’ll never use. And people telling me to take a job, any job, while I “find my feet”. If I do that, I’ll find my feet all right – nailed to the ground. In a way, if I could afford it, I could get any amount of work standing up to my knees in mud somewhere in Britain for no pay. I did plenty of these during the vacations. But I need an actual job, or if I’m going to fund it myself I want it to be really worth while.</p>

Pity none of them is the slightest connected with archaeology! Up to Christmas, I spent most days at the university library and haunting the department, hoping to hear of any opportunities to get my hands dirty on an actual dig. I can’t wait for the Dept to open again, and meanwhile I’m becoming very unpopular around here, and the remarks, particularly J’s, are quite hurtful.</font></p>

				<p><font size="+1">I know it’s one day late for setting ground rules but I had to think of them first</font></p><font size="+1">
<ul>
<li>The whole world can read this, if they’re interested, so I’ll just use initials to protect the innocent. I used J’s real name yesterday but I went back and edited it.
</li><li>I’m not going to drivel on every day. I’ll only drivel on if I have some drivel to say, which won’t be every day. I don’t suppose.
</li><li>I’ll come back and edit this list with any new ground rules I think up.
</li></ul>
<p>So, what is my situation? I’ve been unemployed since graduation, except for a hideous month in summer scratching around on a dig in East Anglia under the world’s rudest Professor, who treated us all like crap and paid less than the minimum wage for sixteen hours in drizzle. It was in a car park which was about to become a Sainsbury’s and the Prof. had persuaded Sains to let him check for Viking artifacts first. They gave him six months, five of which he frittered away trying to get a grant for it. Silly twit. Needless to say, we found nothing.</p>
<p>It’s not quite true that I’ve been out of work the whole time. I did a couple of weeks as a clerk in a garage, which cousin B organised. The money was OK but I had to leave because they were getting me involved in the business, and I’m worried I’ll get diverted from my vocation. </p>
</font><p><font size="+1">I am SERIOUSLY DEDICATED to Archaeology. I know jobs are few and far between, and badly paid, but as long as the company is good and I can afford to live on what I get paid, then I’ll be OK. I do prefer warmer weather than East Anglia, though. The Mediterranean would be nice.<br>

				<p><font size="+1">Well, this is the first entry in my blog.&nbsp;All my&nbsp;friends are blogging these days. It seems to be a good way to keep a diary. I’ve always kept a diary until this year. You can see that it’s taken me 3 days to get this year working.</font></p><font size="+1">
<p>I have to say that one of these days was lost to family stuff. I have such a lot of family you wouldn’t believe it.

From their point of view, and my mother’s, really, I ought to get married, settle down, buy a house, have children, join the happy extended family thing.</p>
