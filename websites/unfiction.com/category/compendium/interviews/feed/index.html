			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="alt"><small>With recent developments surrounding 333 mysterious parcels being delivered to people around the world, and more specifically with the speculative meaning in the contents thereof, many questions were raised about the direction this game was taking. Perplex City is an ambitious project, first announced in February of 2004. In pre-game teaser episodes, it has run the standard alternate reality gaming gauntlet, from email puzzles and blogs to mysterious videos and live one-time events. These episodes have built a steady following among the ARG community over the past year. When a recent puzzle solution led to a sign-up page to receive a posted package, which turned out to contain a set of puzzle cards along with assorted Perplex City swag, chaos ensued as players tried to determine how they fit with the game so far.</p>
<p>Of course, the most obvious route to enlightenment was through Adrian Hon, currently known as "Executive Producer and Director of Play, Mind Candy Design" and the joint lead PuppetMaster behind this alternate reality game. It is unknown whether Mr. Hon was required to relinquish his duties as "Acting Ambassador Plenipotentiary to Perplex City" in order to take up his new post but we're hoping that, at the very least, the pay is better. Anyway, the point is he probably knows a thing or two about stuff and we figured he could set us straight.</small></div>
<p><span id="more-195"></span></p>
<p><strong>Is the "reward" a real, monetary prize or a fictional one?</strong></p>
<p>It is 100% real.</p>
<p><strong>How do you believe the prize will affect the collaborative nature of the game? Do you anticipate a conflict between competition and collaboration?</strong></p>
<p>The prize is merely an incentive to ensure that the Receda Cube is retrieved as quickly as possible, and to help spread the news of the missing cube. I'm sure there will be people who will not collaborate because they want all of the reward for themselves but I suspect that many will see the benefits in collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect people to break into teams?</strong></p>
<p>It'll probably happen, but I don't think it'll be on a large scale.</p>
<p><strong>Would teams be supported by the game (such as the leaderboard, distribution of the "reward") or will players be required to register some sort of unshareable individual accounts?</strong></p>
<p>There are currently no plans for teams to be represented on the leaderboard. Please bear in mind that the leaderboard and points have nothing whatsoever to do with collecting the cube or the reward. As was stated in a recent <a href="http://www.perplexcitysentinel.com/archives/2005/05/receda_cube_rec.html" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.perplexcitysentinel.com/archives/2005/05/receda_cube_rec.html?referer=');">Sentinel article</a>, the points on puzzle cards are only there to mark individual achievement at solving puzzles.</p>
<p>It's simple enough &#8211; the person who returns the cube to us will receive £100,000. That person can do whatever they want with the money. They may not even have a single point to their name!</p>
<p><strong>Is the leaderboard just about gaining individual reputation through points for puzzle solves, or will there be some other sorts of prizes to go along with high rankings?</strong></p>
<p>The main purpose of the leaderboard is about displaying individual achievement. We have not decided anything beyond that.</p>
<p><strong>Do you anticipate leaderboard rankings to be a bone of contention between players or to discourage collaboration on the card puzzles?</strong></p>
<p>Not really, no.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think "campers" who lurk the open forums for puzzle solves and then use them privately to increase their own leaderboard rankings without contributing back to the forum will affect how the forum community plays, for good or ill?</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, I don't think that many forum community players will care about the leaderboard that much. I believe the real interest will be in the search for the cube. The people who just lurk to get puzzle solves are like those who buy a puzzle book and immediately check the back for the answers. What's the point in that? Where's the fun? Puzzle games aren't just about points or ranking, they're about the experience.</p>
<p><strong>How do the cards combine with the web elements?</strong></p>
<p>The cards offer a window into Perplex City and feature many of its people, places and websites, as has already been seen with the Group 333 cards. The cards are a great way for us to get the public in general interested in Perplex City and its missing cube. After all, we expect most people to buy the puzzle cards because they are fun in and of themselves, but we are basing them around Perplex City itself to gain their interest.</p>
<p><strong>Can the game be played independently of purchasing cards?</strong></p>
<p>You will always be able to access Perplex City websites and resources without buying a single card.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any restrictions on how the card information is shared between players?</strong></p>
<p>No, not that we would be able to anyway. However, the puzzle cards are copyrighted so for legal reasons we cannot allow <em>total</em> sharing of card scans.</p>
<p><strong>You've stated in a reply to the Wiki maintainers that you will allow low to medium resolution scans, text transcriptions, and high-resolution zoomed or magnified areas of cards to be publicly posted. I am unclear what the difference is between posting all of this information, which is presumably all that would be required to "play" a card, and simply posting a high-res image of a card. Are you concerned about possible forgeries? Is there some mechanism in place to prevent unscrupulous people from selling forged versions of the cards?</strong></p>
<p>We are concerned about forgeries, partly because they would detract from the quality of the cards and the experience, and partly because we have to fund our efforts in some way.</p>
<p><strong>If a player decides not to purchase any card packs, do they still have a chance of winning the grand prize?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. It will probably be more difficult though, since a strong familiarity with Perplex City will be required to figure out exactly who took the cube, why, and where it is now.</p>
<p><strong>So the cards are an important but not required supplement to the goal of finding the Cube?</strong></p>
<p>They will undoubtedly be a very important supplement, yes.</p>
<p><strong>On the reverse, is it possible to find the cube solely by using the cards?</strong></p>
<p>People will probably require more information about Perplex City than is on the cards to work out what we have not &#8211; where the cube is hidden.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="alt"><em><small>The Cloudmakers group was formed to solve the mystery surrounding the death of fictional character Evan Chan, which eventually turned out to be a game called "The Beast" by it's creators, and designed to promote the upcoming Steven Spielberg movie, A.I. The Cloudmakers group was formed on the Yahoo! Groups service on April 11, 2001.</p>
<p>On April 12, 2001, an individual appeared in the IRC chat room used by some of the Cloudmakers for real-time interaction. Known as "celia," this individual was first believed to be in-game due her strange conversational style and constant quoting from works and along themes that were also utilized within The Beast.</small></em></div>
<p><span id="more-21"></span></p>
<p><small>Eventually, the players realized that celia was not in fact in-game. Some reviled her as a troll and a hoaxer, while others would still find some meaning or connection to the game in her words. Celia never stepped forward to admit who she really was and eventually stopped appearing, except at rare and seemingly random intervals.</p>
<p>Late at night on April 11, 2003, she appeared in channel again.  It appeared that, for celia, the date was already April 12, and this visit marked the second anniversary of celia's initial appearance. At first, celia talked to the mostly sleeping channel, and then messaged me privately. We engaged in a chat that provided an interesting insight into celia's fifth column approach to the original Alternate Reality Game.</p>
<p>The following has been edited from the original format for readability. A copy of the original log is available <a href="/files/celia-raw.txt">here</a>.</small></p>
<p><strong>SB: What anniversary are you celebrating? The Cloudmakers' birthday was April 11th.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CELIA:</strong> Mine, of course. The devil is in the details. So is God. Of course, when is a red herring not?</p>
<p><strong>SB: Are you really the original celia?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CELIA:</strong> I am.</p>
<p><strong>SB: What was up with that? The puppetmasters said it wasn't one of them; why bother?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CELIA:</strong> Mmmm, whispered thoughts for a dark Easter season.</p>
<p><strong>SB: Is there any way you could prove you're the original? It might make for an interesting anniversary interview. Actually, you talk in so many circles, it would probably be interesting regardless.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CELIA:</strong> I remember my first IRC chat was two years ago today, in #evanchan. I always link through Aint It Cool News. My first curve ball was feeding quotes about the 'fawn' in Alice in Wonderland as well as references to the Beatles' 'I am the Walrus.' But I believe people may have begun copycatting me.</p>
<p>I made up celia from 'Alice' &#8212; because the Alice robot site was a big reference in the game's premise.</p>
<p><strong>SB: There were a lot of Alice in Wonderland references in the game, so that threw people again later. People started to think you were real after all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CELIA:</strong> That's why i threw in the fawn.</p>

<div class="alt"><small>Much of the focus lately in the world of Unfiction has been on the decided lack of campaigns that have enjoyed success on the order of the Beast. Certainly amongst the Cloudmakers, the main collective of players that followed the Beast, it's a bit harder to recognize success if it doesn't live up to the scale of that original experience.</p>
<p>However, there were two Alternate Reality Games recently that each culminated in a special event catering to the players. Both events featured bonus schwag being handed out to the attendees. Both events were part of a marketing campaign. And both campaigns were very successful, according to their developers.</small></div>
<p><span id="more-23"></span><br />
I'm talking about <a href="/category/compendium/features/uncap/">Uncap The Ride</a>, a promotion sponsored by BMW in conjunction with their <a href="http://www.bmwfilms.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.bmwfilms.com/?referer=');">BMW Films</a> short films series, and <a href="http://www.experienceit.info/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.experienceit.info/?referer=');">Experience It!</a>, an "experience" developed for the <a href="http://www.boiseartmuseum.org/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.boiseartmuseum.org/?referer=');">Boise Art Museum</a>. The big difference in the two campaigns was their intended scale; but an important similarity is the level of success each had in achieving the project's goal.</p>
<p>BMW Films held its event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on the night of January 11, 2003. But it wasn't as easy as just heading to a location and partying down; players had to contact the "man in the black warmup suit with white stripes" in front of the Stardust casino and ask him for a fork. His response would set them off on a mini-scavenger hunt for clues until they were eventually directed to the main event at the Stratosphere, where the bar was upstairs and a brand new 2003 BMW Z4 was downstairs, waiting to be given away to the lucky winner. According to the puppetmasters, over 20,000 people played the online portion of the game, which began with clues embedded in the first 2001 series of films, but only 250 actually followed through to the end and won a chance to enter the drawing for the car. It was estimated about 200 people showed up for the January 11th event.</p>
<p>The Boise Art Museum event was held, interestingly enough, at the Boise Art Museum and launched a new exhibit by contemporary "video artist" <a href="http://www.djdesign.com/artists/ghavi.html" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.djdesign.com/artists/ghavi.html?referer=');">Gary Hill</a>. Where Uncap The Ride was aimed at a nationwide audience, Experience It! was aimed at attracting an audience from just the Boise, Idaho, area. The Boise Art Museum was reportedly quite pleased with their turnout of close to a hundred people, many of whom were new to the museum.</p>
<p>The Experience It! campaign was launched with a limited scope in mind &#8211; since it led up to a local event, it wasn't really designed to be played worldwide &#8211; yet it still attracted a healthy number of participants, not to mention the attention of a few hardcore ARG communities. The local event attendees weren't told what they were in for until they actually made it to the gallery opening, but a dozens of them still turned out at midnight to see what was up. The campaign was also developed on a short timeline and a small budget.</p>
<p>BMW clearly had a very large budget which made for a quite polished production value, but the Boise Art Museum managed to enjoy much the same success with much less effort. There may be a lesson there to aspiring puppetmasters who wish to make a go of their art as a legitimate business. Though a small-scale campaign may suffer when relying on subscription or ad placement revenue for its business model, the small-scale campaign as the ad itself can be quite effective.</p>
<p>We spoke at length with Jeff Bodell, the man who put the Experience It! campaign together.</p>

<div class="alt"><small>Dave Szulborski took a smidgen of time out from his hectic day and replied to some questions about his wildly popular new ARG <a href="http://www.chasingthewish.net/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.chasingthewish.net/?referer=');">Chasing The Wish</a>. We appreciate this intimate look into the Alternate Reality of his world.</small></div>
<p> <span id="more-22"></span></p>
<p><strong>Chasing the Wish is an impressive campaign so far. Were you blown away from the flood of traffic upon launch, or was it within expected parameters?</strong></p>
<p>The expectations for CTW have changed and grown during the period of development and then through the first month of the game. Based on my previous efforts and what I was initially trying to accomplish with CTW, I originally would have been happy with 200 or so registered players. As the game started to receive substantial "pre-game buzz" and the pre-registration numbers went above 500, I adjusted my expectations and goals. Even so, by the time the game went live, the numbers were reaching the upper limits of what I had ever dreamed of. And finally, the exposure on <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/16/2253241&#038;mode=thread&#038;tid=127&#038;tid=95" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/16/2253241_038_mode=thread_038_tid=127_038_tid=95&amp;referer=');">Slashdot</a> and <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/24344" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.metafilter.com/mefi/24344?referer=');">MetaFilter</a> put everything through the roof and literally doubled the registration database in a day. I (and my various hosting companies) had to do a lot of scrambling to handle the increased traffic. Unfortunately, there are a couple more interviews and articles coming soon in other major media and internet outlets that may just double the size of everything again.</p>
<p><strong>The interactivity is intense, although primarily limited to emails currently. What can players expect to see in the near future?</strong></p>
<p>My plan always was to "ramp up" both the interactivity and the immersiveness as the game progressed, the desired effect being to make the player feel like they are constantly being more and more drawn into this imaginary world. So there will be a natural progression in the game, starting with basically e-mail only interaction, adding phone calls and IMs and eventually moving on to some live, real world, face-to-face interaction. Of course, with thousands of players internationally, it will be impossible to give everyone a chance to interact on all these levels but we're doing our best to distribute the interaction as evenly as possible. The increased levels of interaction are also intended to enhance the immersive nature of the game; everything should seem even more real as players start taking phone calls from live people and receiving actual items and artifacts from the game.</p>
<p><strong>How are things around the CTW 'office'&#8230;any Puppetmasters ready to check into <a href="http://www.klepsydra.net/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.klepsydra.net/?referer=');">Klepsydra</a>?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who has ever tried to do a game like this knows how demanding and time intensive they are; unfortunately, people who don't have that experience have no conception of how much work and dedication is involved. Consequently, there have been a good number of Behind The Scenes volunteers who haven't been able to participate or continue participating as they originally thought they might. I actually anticipated losing some of the volunteer crew as the game went on due to the projected length of CTW but didn't think it would happen so fast.</p>
<p>Luckily, in most cases, as people have dropped out, there have been more than enough volunteers to take on the specific tasks and roles required, necessitating only minor adjustments and additional work on my part. The bad thing is, when you are already literally devoting every waking moment to something, even minor adjustments can seem stressful and devastating. So, in answer to your question, I'm probably the only one ready for a stay at Klepsydra so far. I have them preparing a room for me now.</p>
<p><strong>You say the game is scheduled to last six months. Have the players been keeping pace with what you intended from the beginning?</strong></p>
<p>We're actually about a week behind my original intended timeline, but it's not really a big deal as the game is designed to be very flexible and responsive to the players' actions. These things are so very hard to predict and schedule accurately that you have to leave a lot of room for improvisation or risk having your well-constructed storyline fall apart. Some puzzles or tasks that I think will be solved or accomplished right away stump players and others that I think are tough, they solve right away. So it's dangerous to plan story related events around definite days or times, if they require the players to solve something first. CTW is actually designed, once we get past the introductory material, as separate story arcs or chapters that, for the most part, can be unfolded in any sequence or even simultaneously. Once we reach a certain part in the storyline, I will be able to extend or condense the timeline however I need to.</p>
<p><strong>How does the team feel about automated archivers or site spiders? Are there tools that players are using that aren't "fair game?"</strong></p>
<p>We're not really worried about the archive or web spider programs and what they can potentially turn up or find. In any work of fiction, no matter how carefully crafted, there will always be ways to prove it isn't real or consistent with the "real world." Fictional material, whether novels, movies or ARG games assumes that the reader or viewer or player is willing to "suspend their disbelief" for the duration of the experience. A player who spends their time looking for and obsessing over the "cracks in the facade" is going to find stuff; it's unavoidable, so why waste your time worrying about it? As far as other tools, for the most part, things have been okay. We've obviously had to stay away from puzzles that were entirely Flash-based due to the Flash de-compilers available (even though I don't believe anyone's broken the encryption scheme written into the scripting of the Flash based <a href="http://www.synthasia.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.synthasia.com/?referer=');">Synthasia</a> password portal yet!) but we're constantly finding new technologies and methods to keep things interesting (can anyone say "self-destructing e-mail?") Just wait, there's a lot more fun stuff to come.</p>
<p><strong>Who's the big fan of math coding on staff? Will we have to bone up on our linear algebra skills next?</strong></p>
<p>The math encryption you've seen so far is just part of our attempts to give the players some new and different puzzle types. There are so many different types of encryption and secret message encoding out there that it's a shame that so many games depend on the same techniques and methods. This particular mathematical-based method happens to fit in very well with the concept behind the people or group using it too, so it just seemed like a perfect fit. Upcoming puzzles are going to require everyone to learn some new skill sets, we believe.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.argn.com/archives/chasingthefish/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.argn.com/archives/chasingthefish/?referer=');">Chasing the Fish</a> &#8211; brilliant. Player-run or PM creation?</strong></p>
<p>No comment except to confirm that yes, it is brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>Are you impressed with the amount of press, mainstream or otherwise, that the game has been getting?</strong></p>
<p>Impressed and overwhelmed, actually. I mean, how many people can say that something they've created has been mentioned in both the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/06/technology/circuits/06game.html" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.nytimes.com/2003/03/06/technology/circuits/06game.html?referer=');">New York Times</a> and on the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2000/dot_life/2735905.stm" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2000/dot_life/2735905.stm?referer=');">BBC</a> in the space of a week? And, as I mentioned before, there is more on the way. I have already completed two interviews about Chasing The Wish for major media and internet outlets with a few more scheduled in the near future. I've also been contacted by a new up and coming international wireless network that is interested in licensing CTW or new game content for the debut of the network sometime next year. More on that as it unfolds.</p>
<p><strong>To the best of your knowledge, are there any players going through on their own, without being part of a larger community? If able, can you express the split between players playing in communities and players playing individually?</strong></p>
<p>I haven't broken out the actual numbers yet but my estimate from handling several of the e-mail accounts and viewing server traffic statistics etc, is that there is probably about a 40/60 split between players who interact regularly on the various ARG community sites and those who are playing entirely on their own and may never post on a Forum type site. More than half of the e-mails that we answer are from people that I never see on any ARG sites. Another interesting and challenging division in the player base has been between experienced ARG players and absolute newcomers to the genre. It's been a very difficult task to balance the experienced players' cries of "too easy and not enough content" with the "I'm overwhelmed" comments of the newcomers.</p>
<p>I'm not convinced we've found the right balance yet but I'm constantly monitoring and interacting with select groups of players to try and "fine tune" the story and the release of new material.</p>
<p><strong>There are over 2,100 posts in the <a href="http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/index.php?f=203" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/forums.unfiction.com/forums/index.php?f=203&amp;referer=');">CTW area</a> of <a href="http://www.unforums.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.unforums.com/?referer=');">unforums.com</a>. Are you impressed with the ability of the players to track things and keep material organized? In that vein, any advice you want to give the masses about what to keep note, particularly?</strong></p>
<p>Overall I've been very impressed with the organization and ingenuity the collective player base has shown so far. They have found a lot (but definitely not all) of the hints, clues, and intended mythological and literary references we've built into the game. The need for staying organized is only going to increase, however, as the game progresses and more and more sites, characters, and unsolved mysteries are added to the mix. Besides, it's a great source of reference for the PMs as the game goes on to try and make sure we stay consistent with what's come before. So please, encourage all the players to keep up the great work.</p>

<strong>Elonka Dunin</strong></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Welcome, Elonka, and thank you for coming. Why don't we get right into the interview? Could you tell us a little about yourself, your company, and your current cryptography fame?</strong></p>
<p>Hello SpaceBass, thanks for inviting me to the UnFiction IRC! I'll start with a little background about me for your readers. My name's Elonka Dunin. I'm General Manager of Online Community for Simutronics Corporation. We're one of the longest-running companies that provides MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games). One of our games, GemStone III, has been running since 1989. To my knowledge, among commercial MMORPGs, that makes it the longest-running game in the world! We started on the GEnie online service, and have also provided games via Prodigy, CompuServe, and America Online. Currently the primary way that our customers get to us though, is via our website, at <a href="http://www.play.net/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.play.net/?referer=');">www.play.net</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, enough of the plug about my games; on to crypto stuff. I got involved with the public cryptography subculture a few years ago, via one of the conventions I speak at &#8212; Dragon*Con, in Atlanta. It's a huge convention with thousands of attendees, and has literally hundreds of different sessions and panels on a variety of subjects. I would go to Dragon*Con to speak about online games. But through Dragon*Con, I also met several people in the "hacker" subculture, since they'd be speaking in the same Electronics forums that I was. We'd like wave in the halls and stuff.</p>
<p>Through them, I heard about this code challenge that had gone unsolved for about a year. It was called the "PhreakNIC v3.0 Code". I got curious, and took a look at it one day. Then it totally obsessed me for awhile (a feeling that I'm sure you and your community members can empathize with!).</p>
<p><strong>Oh, definitely.</strong></p>
<p>It took me a week or so (10 days, to be exact), but I cracked it open, and was able to claim the prize (a free trip to a hacker-con). After that, I decided to take a look at some other codes, and I cracked those too. In fact, I cracked so many, that they started barring me from competition&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>No way!</strong></p>
<p>For example, when the "@LANta.con puzzle" came out (pronounced "Atlantacon"), there was a line at the bottom of the flyer which said, "Note: Past puzzle crackers are ineligible for prizes associated with solving the @LANta.con puzzle. Give someone else a chance, Elonka."</p>
<p>Anyway, a few months after that, September 11th happened. Like most of the other people in the country, I was enraged, and willing to do just about anything that I could to help with the war on terrorism. So, I called up my local FBI, and asked if I could help out at all, especially since I had all these handy crypto "skillz" that were nice and fresh in my mind.</p>
<p>They said, "No thank you."</p>
<p>So, I called them back the next week&#8230;and the week after that&#8230;and the week after that&#8230;. And eventually, I finally got someone who said, "Okay, well, what do you know about?"</p>
<p>I listed off a bunch of the cryptographic techniques that I was familiar with, and one of them was "steganography"—</p>
<p><strong>Which was a big buzzword at the time already&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>—That got their attention, since there were currently rumors going around that Al Qaeda was using steganographic techniques to pass secret messages back and forth. So, they asked me to put together a presentation on what steganography was, and how it might be used.</p>
<p>I did, and presented it at a meeting of the St. Louis FBI Computer Crimes Task Force. It was a gathering of representatives from several different agencies, including the FBI, Secret Service, Postal Inspectors, Customs Agents, Asst. U.S. Attorneys, and so forth. My talk was well-received, and other people who saw it encouraged me to present it at other venues as well.</p>
<p>I gave it at a major hacker convention in Las Vegas called "Def Con", and several other places (including Dragon*Con, of course). I also posted my slides on the web. And Bruce Schneier, a world-famous cryptographer, took a look at them, and kindly provided a <a href="http://elonka.com/steganography/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/elonka.com/steganography/?referer=');">link to my site</a> in one of his monthly newsletters (<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0212.html" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0212.html?referer=');">Crypto-Gram</a>). That one link immediately deluged me with literally thousands of visitors over a few days.</p>
<p><strong>He has a lot of readers.</strong></p>
<p>Including yourself. When I saw that unfiction was linking to me, I decided to pop over and take a look at your forums. We met, we chatted, and you asked me to come in for an interview, and here I am!</p>
<p>How was that for an introduction?</p>
<p><strong>That was great! It was rather unexpected to hear from you. How much of the site did you look at?</strong></p>
<p>I just scanned through bits and pieces. You definitely seem to have a large and thriving community!</p>
<p><strong>Well as I keep telling people, 95% of the community is lurkers. That holds between games as well as during. A lot of people like to play along and follow the boards, without actively participating. But sometimes they'll chime in out of the blue with a solution that's been plaguing the group for awhile.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have similar statistics on our boards. We find that only about half of our players visit the forums at all, and of those in the forums, less than 10% post on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Hmm, that's interesting. I suppose it's probably a similar situation with any community. The chatting community is an even smaller subsection of the overall, as well.</p>
<p>Had you had any prior experience with code-cracking and cryptography before that first PhreakNIC code?</strong></p>
<p>Well, not on that scale, but yes. My mother tells me that I was fascinated by puzzles, going all the way back to when I was a toddler. I also remember when I was a kid, that I saw a neighborhood boy who had a book on codes (I think it was for a boy scout merit badge), and I asked if I could read it (he ended up giving it to me). Plus I was a voracious reader in the local library, checking out the maximum number of books on each visit &#8212; I especially loved puzzle-solving stories such as "Danny Dunn" or "Encyclopedia Brown".</p>
<p>Most of my code-solving skills were pretty simple though—substitution ciphers and grids. I didn't start learning about the more elaborate systems such as Vigenere, PGP, UUencoding, and steganography, until I started digging into the PhreakNIC v3.0 Code. I had to come up to speed fast! But then again, that gave me an edge, since everything was very fresh in my mind. I think another thing that gave me an edge, was that I came from a "pencil and paper" background. I didn't want to (and still don't want to) use computer utilities to crack codes. I'm far happier figuring it out myself, or doing it in my head.</p>
<p><strong>Whoa.</strong></p>
<p>When I'd get stuck on something, I'd go and pull out the Scrabble set and dump the tiles on the table, and then move things around, looking to see if any new pattern might inspire me. I'll also talk to everyone I can about a place I'm stuck. Not just to college-level cryptologists, but I'll talk to kids, and even toddlers.</p>
<p><strong>Wow, that's a unique tactic.</strong></p>
<p>Because if everyone else in the "grownup" field is stuck, maybe that kid will come up with an idea that nobody else thought of!</p>
<p>One day when I went to a 2600 meeting (a hacker organization), there was a guy at the meeting who had a shirt printed with hundreds of binary digits. I asked him if it said anything, or if it was just random. He said that it had a message. I told him not to tell me what it was, and then I pulled out pen and paper, and worked it out by hand. No computer&#8230;just me and my memory.</p>
<p><strong>Good lord.</strong></p>
<p>They were all pretty dazzled.</p>
<p><strong>Gee, I wonder why.</strong></p>
<p>Have you had a chance to look at the <a href="http://members.aol.com/nova1337/tutorial.htm" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/members.aol.com/nova1337/tutorial.htm?referer=');">PhreakNIC v3.0 Code Tutorial</a> that I wrote yet?</p>
<p><strong>Some, but I haven't read it all.</strong></p>
<p>I tried to write it in a very entertaining "tongue in cheek" fashion, with a lot of humorous references to cyberculture. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>It's an excellent resource for our community, actually. More than one person has remarked to me that your description of the PhreakNIC code is almost exactly like playing through a portion of an Alternate Reality Game. The nested puzzles are pretty common&#8230;the only difference is that in an ARG, you generally win some advancement of the story after solving a puzzle. Or you gain access to someplace or someone that you couldn't reach before.</strong></p>
