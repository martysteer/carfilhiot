			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/despoiler.jpg" class="alignright" />Unfiction is proud to announce the launch of <a href="http://despoiler.org/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/despoiler.org/?referer=');">Despoiler.org</a>, a sister site dedicated to releasing information into wild. It will, of course, be focused on the Alternate Reality Gaming and Chaotic Fiction communities and will provide free wiki resources for their pursuits. Wikis may be requested via a contact form on the site and usage will be subject to a modified version of the terms of service that have worked quite well so far on our own <a href="http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/forums.unfiction.com/forums/?referer=');">forums</a>.</p>
<p>One wiki has already been created and seeded for those of you following the <a href="http://www.goldenjigsaw.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.goldenjigsaw.com/?referer=');">Golden Jigsaw puzzle</a>.</p>
<hr />
Every so often, a campaign comes along that either by design or by accident pits players against each other in a battle to keep their information secret. Since this dynamic runs quite counter to the Unfiction norm, in the end it mainly causes trouble for the moderators and administrators who must worry about which user was posting as a guest merely to disseminate information anonymously and which was really a puppetmaster attempting to post in disguise. It is my hope that Despoiler may serve as an outlet for those player necessities and make it easier on those of us who attempt to facilitate the discussion.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we received our largest-ever donation. The $8,000 sum will fund the community's hosting and overhead costs for an entire year. </p>
<p>The amazing gift came from Andy Darley, recent winner of Perplex City's Season One cash prize, and will allow us to focus on continuing to offer a sustainable, free resource for our players.</p>
<p><span id="more-215"></span></p>
<p><img src="/image/cube-sm.jpg" alt="T3h K00b" title= "T3h K00b" class="alignleft" />Explaining his financial support for Unfiction, Darley said: "Perplex City is the first ARG to end with a significant sum of money in the hands of one of its players, and it's only right that some of that money should find its way back to benefit the whole ARG community."</p>
<p>This extremely generous contribution by Andy Darley will allow us to focus our attention for the first time on future projects instead of having to worry about where next month's hosting costs will come from. We will now be able to concentrate on building up other revenue streams, and directing those revenues towards the growth and promotion of the genre as a whole.</p>
<p>It may not seem like a great deal of money to some people but all of our work is done by volunteers, without whom we would be hard-pressed to continue, and this is a great opportunity for us. We are very grateful to Mr. Darley for this gift.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Unforum hack causes disruption in service]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of our servers (sadly enough, Gibson) was compromised yesterday and used to launch a flood of spam. Our <a href="http://www.serverbeach.com/catalog/index.php?REF=7Q9WRWBAKZ" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.serverbeach.com/catalog/index.php?REF=7Q9WRWBAKZ&amp;referer=');">excellent host</a> caught it quickly and shut everything down, but we've had to rewipe and reload everything from scratch in order to make sure the forums software is as secure as possible, as our old patchwork code was the most likely weak point. We're taking this opportunity to add some new features, but it will take a bit of time before all of the old functionality returns. We thank you for your patience as we work furiously to bring uF back!</p>
<p>Keep an eye on our <a href="http://status.unfiction.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/status.unfiction.com/?referer=');">Status Page</a> for brief updates on progress.</p>
