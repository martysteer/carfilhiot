			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/rumors/caseofthecovetedbottleblonde.jpg" class="alignright" />You've seen our previous announcement about <a href="http://www.despoiler.org/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.despoiler.org/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unfiction.com%2Fcategory%2Frumors%2F');">Despoiler</a>, of course, and know all about how you can <a href="http://www.despoiler.org/contact/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.despoiler.org/contact/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unfiction.com%2Fcategory%2Frumors%2F');">request a wiki</a> for use in connection with your favorite game, right? But if you hadn't actually gone there, you might not know that we've also already begun posting trailhead and tip links on Despoiler before we post them to the forums. The other day, we <a href="http://www.despoiler.org/2007/08/05/the-case-of-the-coveted-bottle/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.despoiler.org/2007/08/05/the-case-of-the-coveted-bottle/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unfiction.com%2Fcategory%2Frumors%2F');">posted a tip about a new game</a>, "The <a href="http://www.caseofthecovetedbottle.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.caseofthecovetedbottle.com/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unfiction.com%2Fcategory%2Frumors%2F');">Case of the Coveted Bottle</a>," promotes Sarah Jessica Parker's new perfume, "Covet." <a href="http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=20583" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=20583&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unfiction.com%2Fcategory%2Frumors%2F');">Discussion has already begun on our forums</a>, which you are welcome to join.</p>
<p>First, I want to thank whoever was behind the "shout-out" to Unfiction in the "How to Play" section of the official site. Second, I want to point out something about the design of this contest that I think is really clever: the way they've added bonus tiers to the prize scheme. Basically, it is a puzzle contest game, where "leads" are releases each week for which you receive points for solving. Once you have enough points, you're entered automatically in the grand prize drawing.</p>
<p><span id="more-220"></span></p>
<p>Now here's the clever part: the designers have clearly recognized that they cannot forestall someone coming along in the last week, finding all of the puzzle solutions, then entering the drawing and winning. Sometimes this is referred to as "sniping" by those who were dedicated in following the entire contest from the beginning. But you can't really stop this because what about people who didn't even hear about the contest until the end? You can't really leave them out, can you?</p>
<p>Instead of trying to persuade (won't work) people not to do this, or to control the public posting of solutions (impossible), these designers instead have embraced the chaos. They actively encourage their players to collaborate and work together and the tiered bonus prize structure implicity encourages players to play along from the start &#8211; if you enter a puzzle solution within seven days of the puzzle's release, you're automatically entered in a bonus prize drawing.</p>
<p>Not only that but they've come up with a separate challenge that allows people to demonstrate their own creativity and provide their own content, in the form of two upcoming movie-making challenges, which bring with them the opportunity for their own bonus prizes.</p>
<p>As I said, this is very clever, and I applaud the designers' ability to focus on encouraging the good bits rather than trying to battle futilely against the less desirable elements.</p>
<p>Also, we are seriously going to use any excuse we can to keep reposting this picture. I might make it my avatar, even.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/despoiler.jpg" class="alignright" />Unfiction is proud to announce the launch of <a href="http://despoiler.org/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/despoiler.org/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unfiction.com%2Fcategory%2Frumors%2F');">Despoiler.org</a>, a sister site dedicated to releasing information into wild. It will, of course, be focused on the Alternate Reality Gaming and Chaotic Fiction communities and will provide free wiki resources for their pursuits. Wikis may be requested via a contact form on the site and usage will be subject to a modified version of the terms of service that have worked quite well so far on our own <a href="http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/forums.unfiction.com/forums/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unfiction.com%2Fcategory%2Frumors%2F');">forums</a>.</p>
<p>One wiki has already been created and seeded for those of you following the <a href="http://www.goldenjigsaw.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.goldenjigsaw.com/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unfiction.com%2Fcategory%2Frumors%2F');">Golden Jigsaw puzzle</a>.</p>
<hr />
Every so often, a campaign comes along that either by design or by accident pits players against each other in a battle to keep their information secret. Since this dynamic runs quite counter to the Unfiction norm, in the end it mainly causes trouble for the moderators and administrators who must worry about which user was posting as a guest merely to disseminate information anonymously and which was really a puppetmaster attempting to post in disguise. It is my hope that Despoiler may serve as an outlet for those player necessities and make it easier on those of us who attempt to facilitate the discussion.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What happens when a guerilla marketing campaign spawns its own guerilla marketing in turn? Recursion! It's what's for dinner.</p>
<p><img src="/image/compendi/guerilla.zero.jpg" alt="Year Zero logo spotted in wild" /></p>
<p>I spotted this attempt at stencil art on my way home for lunch today, spray-painted on the surface of a pedestrian bridge that crosses over the railroad line. <a href="http://yearzero.nin.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/yearzero.nin.com/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unfiction.com%2Fcategory%2Frumors%2F');">Year Zero</a> fans may recognize it as the logo for the <a href="http://opensourceresistance.net/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/opensourceresistance.net/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unfiction.com%2Fcategory%2Frumors%2F');">Open Source Resistance</a>, an in-game call to action.</p>
<p>I believe this is the first time I have spotted in meatspace content connected with an ARG that appears to have been generated and placed by a player rather than the puppetmasters. </p>
