Greyhaven
</H3>
<H4>
Landfall in Middle Earth was a disappointment.
The docks are very far from being picturesque, there was such a haze
that we could hardly see beyond the dockside cranes, and the
formalities became so extended that it was mid-afternoon before we
actually stood on <i>terra firma</i>.
<P>
Then began the endless negotiation to which one becomes accustomed
in foreign travel. First, we were obliged to find, claim and assemble
our scattered belongings from their places on the dock. Then
we were required to explain to a skeptical Customs 
House officer why we were 
travelling with canoes. "Are not our vessels good enough for 
you, Sirs?" he rumbled. He was a large man in a blue uniform that
had always been too small for him, and was now even less adequate
since he had evidently had lunch, which we hadn't. One of our
packs had disappeared, and he clearly had no intention
of raising the alarm and sending out search parties. The
Boy volunteered to hunt for it, as the officer was clearly
irritating him a great deal. Then,
from a spirit of curiosity, rather than suspicion of our
intentions, the Customs officer insisted on disembowelling every 
item of
baggage, inspecting the contents to a terrible extent and asking questions.
<P>
"Why do you bring food?"
<P>
"We plan to travel where food is 
unobtainable, and we require it to be compact, long-lasting 
and light in weight." 
<P>
"What is this?" 
<P>
"A patent fishing reel." 
<P>
"And this?" 
<P>
"Dubbin for treatment of walking shoes."	
<P>
"Why?" and so on.

<P>
Eventually, he appeared to have exhausted his ability to delay us
further, and we plainly had not imported anything illegal. He had
tasted various items of food, stared through the Boy's telescope,
read, or pretended to read, a paragraph or two of each book and
fingered every container for secret compartments. 
<P>
We re-packed the baggage, finding an oil lamp left over with no 
place to stow it.
At the last minute, the Boy appeared with four dwarves
carrying our missing pack,
which had been serving as an impromptu sofa at
the other end of the dock. 
The Boy clearly thought the dwarves were part of a circus
act, not remembering that they are numerous and do much of the 
heavy labour
in Middle Earth. 
<P>
Our Customs officer drew a second wind and insisted on subjecting
the final item to a further autopsy, taking his time and enjoying
every hour he spent on the job. The Bosun, who had consumed so much 
tobacco in his pipe during our wait that
the area was now engulfed in aromatic smoke, whispered to me that a 
small gift of money
might have expedited matters, but I knew better than that. If
they make no hint of asking for money, foreign officials are likely
to clap you in irons if you offer. This man was plainly on a mission
of investigation in which every detail had to be savoured. To
discard this mission in favour of mere money would, I am sure, have
been an ethical impossibility.
<P>
Since we docked no later than eight in the morning, we had hoped 
to meet with Carlton-Browne <i>(the British Consul
in Greyhaven, who had promised to arrange a local guide for the party, 
further evidence of tacit official sanction for their trip - Ed.)</i>, 
to start on our way and to quit Greyhaven before nightfall, but 
the delays occasioned by our uniformed friend forced us to store our
baggage and canoes at the dock and take lodgings for the night. Arranging
temporary storage resulted in further extended negotiation, this time 
 with an officious civilian, and left little time to find
lodgings. 
<P>
Even so, we should have spent longer on the search for accommodation.
We chose the hotel <i>Prince Albert</i> for its
proximity to the dock, and for its encouragingly anglophile name. Its
proximity was not in any doubt, as we were reminded all night by the 
deafening sounds of delicate cargoes being dropped from a great
height into resoundingly empty railway wagons. The "Prince Albert"
of its title was, however, not obviously related to the gentle consort
of Her Majesty, but presumably to some minor Princeling of Hades. I shall not
waste words on a detailed description of our vicissitudes, as
I plan, next year, to write a three-volume summary of them.
<i>(This seems to be a joke, as I can find no evidence of such
a work. - Ed.)</i>
<P>
However, should you encounter the Boy, or the Bosun, you may provide
yourself with some harmless entertainment by asking them for
a description of the <i>Prince Albert's</i> Cockroach and Pussy Cat 
Pie, or the <i>Prince Albert's</i> Famous
Gripewater Beer. You may further irritate them by asking
how it feels to sleep on a mattress seemingly filled with pipe-wrenches
and damp socks.
<P>
Suffice to say that had the hotel paid us five shillings to
lodge there, rather than charging us the same, it would still
have been outrageously expensive.
