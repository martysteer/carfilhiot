Weathertop
</H3>
<H4>
<P>
Out from Bree along the East Road, the travellers, having
some confidence in their Guide, once again
attempted to vary the route, this time crossing the railway
and entering undulating countryside to the North.
The mountain Amon Soul (pronounced Ah-mon Sool) - 
Weathertop, as it was called by Tolkien - 
could already be seen a day's march or more to
the East, and the road appeared to be turning South,
away from their direct route. The Boy was particularly
keen to make the ascent, and the Guide promised that the
route was well-trodden, and not exceptionally arduous.
<P>
They soon encountered the marshes that bedevilled
Frodo and his companions, an area that, to this day,
is largely a wet wasteland centred on the lake Tolkien
calls Midge Water - a literal translation of Sykke-Nin. No 
photographs were taken,
but the journey evinced some amusing comments about
the venomous midges in the area.
<P>
<UL>Including:
<LI>The Boy <I>These midges are so large, we should catch and skin them.
It would not take more than half a dozen to make a useful
hat;</I>
<LI>The Bosun <I>We should take a breeding pair home with us.
They'd make a fine weapon of war at sea;</I>
<LI>The Boy <I>With a suitable harness, and a domesticated one
of these flies, we could conquer the air;</I>
<LI>The Scholar <I>When these creatures bite, they take a
lump of meat from your leg and retire to a safe distance
to devour it;</I>
</UL>
<P>
The ponies suffered badly, sometimes being black with insects.
<P>
Even the Guide was not immune, as the midges could seek out tender parts
of his lips and gums, and in a very short time all members of the party
were grateful to return to the tedious but relatively painless road.
<P>
This part of the book is characterised by a mood of depression
and regret for wasted time. The Scholar clearly believes that
a rail or coach journey at this stage would have been advisable, just to
save this tedious leg of the trip.

Amon Soul
</H3>
<H4>
We could now see Amon Soul (<I>Ed. Weathertop</I>) much more clearly.  
Though it is not, according to the Boy, 
a tall mountain, it is impressive, rising from the
flatlands around it as the highest and most Southerly peak in a small range of
hills and mountains. A number of small villages and a few trees and
bushes cluster around Amon Soul's base, but the upper slopes are
cruelly bare.
<P>
The Boy became very excited as we approached, and he began to discuss the route
of 'our' ascent with the Guide, who reassured him that the peak was
frequently climbed and that a path existed. At a point on the road that the
traveller may recognise only by the fact that it is marked by a large boulder covered
in indecipherable runes, we turned North East from the East Road and, after
a march of half a day, entered a small 
village (which has no name on our maps, and which calls itself, so far as
the Guide could inform us, 'The Town', or, if pressed, the 'The Town
West of Amon Soul'). (<I>This appears on the map as "Walker's Village" Ed.</I>)
We entered its main
street, attracting as little local attention as a travelling
circus might. The Guide was busy, explaining our presence (which
was more than <I>we</I> could have done) in the local
dialect. The Guide himself seemed as interesting to the populace as we 
strange foreigners, though they did not crowd around him in the way they did us.
Once we had shed a few of the inquisitive peasants, impudent children
and barking dogs seemingly intent on abducting us as souvenirs, we were able to 
renew our provisions at a small and well-stocked general store, and 
to continue out of the village on a track which wound
upwards, surrounded by a crowd who found our every mannerism hilarious.
One by one, they called farewells and fell back, until after a half hour of 
stiff climbing, our entourage had been reduced to a silent but
persistent old man and his huge hound-like dog. 
<P>
The old man insisted on leading the
procession, keeping ahead of the Guide and our ponies with a long,
ground-devouring stride of his thin limbs. The Guide confided to us that
the old man had once been what passes in these parts for a police officer,
and commanded much respect in the district. Further, he was of
"Royal" blood, whatever that means in those parts.
His name translated as <i>Walker</i>, which we could easily believe, as
he proved very good at it. 
The old man's dog was nearly as tall as our ponies, but rakishly thin, and it
constantly eyed us all speculatively as though we were a sort of mobile 
supper. It had plainly eaten little
lately - perhaps only a small boy or two and a stray horse.
When we stopped to rest,
the Bosun prepared tea, as usual, and the old man shared a cup with us,
never breaking into a smile, but making a moue of approval. After the
refreshments he gestured to the worsening weather. A storm was clearly
brewing to the North. Then he waved in a benedictory fashion and turned
back to his village, calling a single word to his dog, which gave
us a hungry glance before following him.
<P>
The track to the summit is not direct, but follows a series of ridges
that are aiming for the main saddle between Amon Soul and the smaller
peak to its North, Gonuid.  The route is well-travelled, as it leads over
the ridge to a village on the Eastern slopes of 
Amon Soul. Our climb was steady, but not exhausting, and our only
concern was the accumulation of dark clouds now obscuring Gonuid and
the other peaks to the North. The trees, hitherto fairly frequent,
became more sparse as we climbed, and the Guide recommended we make
camp in a copse just before the final steep climb to the ridge. 
Amon Soul was now to our South-East. We had hardly made fast
our tents and stores when the storm arrived. It did not rain as
that term is understood in England. It was, rather, as though
a bathtub of Cyclopean proportions had been suddenly
inverted above our camp. According to the Bosun, 
the soaking we received, the squalls, the lightning flashes 
and the explosions of thunder closely resembled the effect of a
battleship in close combat in heavy weather. Based on this comparison, both the
Boy and I resolved to avoid Naval service, should we ever have
become tempted by the Bosun's tales of exotic travel and adventure
undertaken at the expense of Her Majesty. Luckily, our ordeal was
over before our possessions and ponies had been swept all the way 
back to the foot of the hill. The Guide had chosen well. Our
camp site was well-drained and somewhat sheltered from the worst
of the wind. Indeed, the ponies seemed less
disturbed by the experience than they had been by the eerie quiet
of the Barrow Downs. We were then able to observe the storm
delivering its contents to the South as we settled to a warming fire
of fallen twigs, a cooked evening meal and an early bed.
<P>
Another incident is worth recording.  Throughout his time with us,
the Guide had carried his hen, feeding and watering it regularly,
and generally making its life comfortable, even allowing it to
wander a little when we camped. We had concluded that
the bird was some kind of pet.  Thus our astonishment when
this evening he removed it from its cage, murmured to it
gently, then bit its head off, skinned it deftly and consumed it raw. It was a
grisly sight indeed, and the Bosun was moved to cry "Oh, I say!"
in protest.
<P>
"You think me cruel?" asked the Guide.
<P>
"I do.  You have carried that bird for a week, with every appearance
of care, only to kill and eat it so suddenly."
<P>
"Imagine you were that bird," replied the Guide. "Would you prefer
a comfortable life with no threat or fear, or would you prefer
the life of a hen taken to market, where it is hung up by the
feet from a hook, starved, and treated like a parcel until
someone kills it carelessly, or it dies of neglect? I
do not needlessly torture my food, nor subject it to
disease and neglect. Such behaviour does not improve its
flavour or value. Its end was swift and merciful."
We had to admit that he was right, as he often proved to be
in subsequent weeks.
<P>
By nine o'clock of the following morning, having ridden up the track through
pine woods, then rough scrub, and finally bare rocks and stones,
we could see the ridge above us. At the Boy's suggestion, we 
agreed to lead the ponies in order to spare them the exertion and risk 
of carrying us up the precipice. Perched on precipitous slopes, occasional sheep, 
as wiry as greyhounds,
grazed on the hillside. Heaven knows what they found to eat.
Nourishing pebbles, perhaps. An hour later, puffing with exertion,
the Bosun and I gained the ridge, where the Guide and the Boy
awaited us with the superior patience of athletes who understand
the frailty of mere mortal man. Here we turned off the main track, which 
descends the Eastern face of the ridge, to climb
the ridge of Amon Soul to our South. Even off the main track, the
path to the summit, though narrow, is well-trodden, and easily wide enough for the
ponies. This proved convenient for the Bosun and the Scholar,
but the stoic Boy insisted on walking when he could have ridden, while
the Guide, of course, never rode.
<P>
The outlook from the summit of Amon Soul is inspiring, permitting, as it does, a 
view of up to a hundred miles in every direction. The summit is actually
rather broad, and the pinnacle one can see from below is a huge cairn built
from stones fetched by centuries of climbers. The summit area is walled with
an ancient rampart, which has fallen to a height of two or three feet in
most places, the building blocks no doubt being incorporated into the cairn.
<P>
We walked around the area for some twenty minutes. It was 
perishing cold, and, though I would not have missed the experience,
only the Boy appeared to truly appreciate the windswept glory of the place.
Far below, we could see the East Road, the village we had visited the 
previous day, and the route we would follow through another village and 
back to the Road.  A plume of smoke and a rattling to the West indicated
the position of a distant railway train. Above us, a large black bird, 
of a species I could not identify, described huge, slow circles in a 
manner reminiscent of an eagle or vulture.
<P>
A curious accident occurred on the way down the hill.  We heard a rush of air
and saw the large bird dropping in front of us. It then pivoted around and 
flew straight towards us. We could now see it was huge, ten feet or
more from tip to tip of its wings. While Nature often shows us
creatures of great power and ferocity, seldom does she show them as evil. Yet
from this bird came an unmistakable malevolence which we all felt.
It was black all over like a raven, except
for glittering yellow eyes. The Boy was standing in the
stirrups of the leading pony, the better to view this marvel, 
and as the bird approached, the pony reared, depositing him on
the ground. The bird made a curious screech, in which words
could almost be heard, just as a talking parrot may sound,
and turned away to circle again. All our mounts bolted a little,
and the Guide flung himself to the ground, but order was soon restored.
However, the boy was found to have fallen on a piece of jagged
metal, which had grazed his side.  Imagine our surprise when we
discovered that it was a broken dagger.  
<P>
The Guide warned us immediately not to touch the dagger. "Such
weapons seek out mortals to harm," he said, examining it where it
lay on the ground by the path, "This dagger is very ancient."
<P>
"Oh, come, it is only a dagger," I replied, "Its blade would not
cut butter.  And it cannot be so old. There is no sign of rust
on the blade, even though it is broken."  But The Guide would 
have none of it, picked the weapon up between two stones, and
dropped it over the side of the ridge before I had the 
opportunity to examine it.  All I can recall is that it
was unnaturally dark, almost black, and that both the hilt and
the stump of blade were engraved with an indecipherable script.
<P>
The Guide then turned his attention to the Boy, seeking to 
clean the wound. "If any piece of the knife is in the
wound, it will enter your body like a worm, and kill you,"
he warned.
<P>
"Nonsense! It is only a graze," replied the Boy, "I have suffered
worse in fencing classes.  And I have
no desire to remove my shirt here and now.  Let us
attend to it, if necessary, later. I am more concerned that oversized
crow may return."  However, the large bird had disappeared for the
time being.

The descent to the East Road was uneventful, and the travellers spent a night
in one of the coaching inns, and might have been tempted to take the
daily coach on to Arvendel (Tolkien's Rivendell) had the Guide been
prepared to bring the ponies on separately. Though the Boy was showing
signs of fever, his minor wound appeared clean. 
The Bosun thought the Boy's fever might be malaria, contracted
in the swamps, but the Guide was sure it was his brush with the
mysterious knife. The Boy himself was unconcerned,
and so they all continued Eastwards.
<P>
They crossed the famous Mithael Bridge, spending a night in one
of the busy Inns near the thoroughfare. The Inn was called the
local equivalent of "The Ford" - a name dating back to before the
15th Century road bridge and 19th Century rail bridge which are
here within half a mile of each other.

Mithael
</H3>
<H4>
For some reason, known only to God, the inhabitants of Mithael have no
clear concept of hot water. Our innkeeper appeared to comprehend the words,
when spoken in a variety of tongues, yet the water provided for our tea
at breakfast might conveniently be described as <i>chambr&eacute;</i>, like
a fine claret at the Travellers' Club. For some twenty minutes, the Bosun and 
I were engaged in delicate negotiations towards an increase in temperature for 
our tea, during which The Guide regarded our antics with amused tolerance
and the kitchen lad was sent scurrying back and forth. The breakfast was
in all other respects better than tolerable, and our banter had lost
its edge with general contentment, when the Boy appeared in the
breakfast room looking like a dead man, and moving no faster.
<P>
The Boy sat at our table, refusing nourishment of any kind, and apologised for his
low state, suggesting that we others continue while he recuperated and
joined us in a few days by train.  I would not have wagered a guinea on the prospect
of his recovery at all at that moment, far less a rapid one. He refused at
first to show us the wound, but the Guide would brook no opposition, and
removed the Boy's shirt then and there in the breakfast room, regardless of
embarrassment.  
<P>
What I am about to tell you may sound strange, but I
assure the reader that it is absolutely true. Having inspected the red
and angry gash in the Boy's side, which was clearly poisoned, the Guide spoke
in the local dialect to the kichen lad, who was obviously terrified of
him. The lad went out and returned with a plate of bread and an old tablecloth. 
The Guide poked at the bread, which looked perfectly good to me, then spoke
sharply to the kitchen lad, who ran out with the bread and returned some minutes later with 
the end of a rather stale loaf. This was still not old enough, apparently,
and the Guide repaired to the kitchen in person, returning with a handful
of green-tinged lumps of the least appetising bread I had yet seen, (not including
the offerings of the Prince Albert at Greyhaven). These the Guide fashioned
into a poultice, using the luke-warm water intended for our tea, and attached
the poultice to the wound with strips torn from the old tablecloth. 
<P>
I later discovered,
on inspecting the inn-keeper's bill, that the tablecloth, far from being the 
torn and stained remnant it had appeared, must have been a valuable antique!
The sacrifice was, nevertheless, well worth while, as the treatment, renewed 
twice daily, worked extremely well, and within a few days the Boy was as good
as new. Further, the inn-keeper failed to recognise our use of a valuable
medicament (the miraculous green bread), and forgot to charge us for it!
I have since heard that the mould which forms upon bread was known
to the ancient Egyptians as a cure for infection.
<P>
During the two days of the Boy's recovery, the Guide showed the Bosun and 
myself some of the local wonders. These included the bridge, which is of a type
we have seen in France, and a large and attractive town square, surrounded
by ornate civic buildings. There is also a huge medieval fort whose 
ruined state is due to repeated plunderings for building materials by the Church.
This thoughtless destruction of historical monuments is common in Middle Earth.
I fancy that only the extreme desirability of crossing the river dry-shod 
has preserved the Mithael bridge largely intact.
<P> 
As a result, perhaps, of the ready availability of raw materials from the fort, there
are many churches in Mithael, including a large eighteenth century barn
which styles itself "Cathedral", but in which I would not stable my horses,
due to its inelegant architectural style, which resembles a small barracks
block, surmounted by a pimple, crowned with a cricket stump (<i>Ed. This is true</i>). 
The Guide spoke knowledgeably about the
town, but declined to enter any of the Churches. The Church has been inimical
to his race throughout recorded history, with many periods of persecution.
"My tribe," he explained, "Has had the misfortune to ally itself to
leaders whom the Church named, often after the event, as evil.  
Indeed, our leaders made such mistakes in both the pre- and post-Christian eras.  
This has given us a reputation
somewhat worse than Jews, and we are variously thought to be demons, hobgoblins,
or apes. We are barred from proper education and those of my race who have wished
to become Christians in this country have been denied the privilege on the 
basis of our appearance. The men of Middle Earth value us as mine workers in peace time,
and as warriors when the country is
under attack, but our services are soon forgotten."
<P>
"How, then," I asked during one of our walks through the town, "Have you
become so well-schooled? How did you learn English, for example?"
<P>
"Ha!" he replied, "One Scholar recognises another! My early education was in
a tribal school, then I attended a Spanish college, posing as a Moor, where I learned 
Spanish, French, English, History and much besides."
<P>
"How could you afford such extended studies?"
<P>
"Our tribe, as I told you, are miners in time of peace. We mine precious metals, especially
gold. We can afford anything we wish. Unfortunately, we do not reproduce as
readily as other races and many are born crippled. Some say that the
metals we mine cause these infirmities, but we must earn our
living. However, men will always outbreed us, and so we do not push ourselves 
forward. There is a legend that a wizard called Zaruman created our race
from the unholy wedding of men and goblins, and that this is the origin of
our infirmities."
<P>
Though somewhat embarrassed by these confidences, I asked why a scholar of
his quality should become our Guide. He replied that it amused him to do so, especially
since he could obtain no better employment than mining in his native land.
<P>
(<i>The above section hinting at the history of The Guide's race is not 
unique in the book, yet it is nowhere comprehensively treated.  
It is a sad fact that the remainder of the 
Uruk-Hai race in Middle Earth was wiped out in the Winter of 1928 by an epidemic of 
influenza to which they turned out to be highly susceptible. Ed.</i>)

The Boy's recovery was extremely swift, and the travellers lost only 
about a day and a half, since they had planned to spend half a day in
Mithael.  They also made good progress along the well-paved road to the East.
The narrative resumes at the point where The Guide turns the party off the road
to see The Giants, a diversion of a dozen miles or so. 
<P>
<i>Like Mithael, and unlike many of the other sites visited by the Scholar, 
The Giants are still in the state in which he left them, and
can be viewed today, provided a visa can be obtained. Though a Tourist
Administration exists, travel to Mithael District purely for the purpose 
of Tourism is not routinely permitted,
but a permit for non-invasive research may be obtained by <i>bona fide</i>
academics, and a short-stay visa will usually be granted on presentation of a 
permit together with an astonishingly impudent sum of money.</i>

According to the Guide, this area had at one time been totally wooded,
but there was no evidence whatever of trees, most of the terrain, where
it was not too steep to plough, being tilled for the growing of
wheat and barley. Where the land was too precipitous for crops, but
not quite vertical, we saw cattle and sheep clinging to the rock face,
munching stones, as seems the usual diet in Middle Earth of animals which
elsewhere aspire to be herbivores.
<P>  
The last part of the journey was up a steep fissure in an unremarkable 
flat-topped hill, but as we emerged on the plateau we were greeted with the
most amazing array of limestone pillars.

Abandoning our ponies to feed in a nearby quarry, we spent a full two hours
in exploring what was a fairly extensive area of natural beauty. The Boy was
so far recovered that he could not resist scaling a pillar of some sixty feet.
For my part, I managed to obtain a number of excellent photographs.
<P>
On the way down, with the sun setting to our left, the Guide told us several
stories about the region, which was once thought to be the haunt of witches 
and trolls. The limestone outcrops are popularly believed to be the petrified
bodies of trolls and giants, rendered immobile by the witches. It is also
rumoured that the figures move around under cover of darkness, though they
always return to their places before dawn.
<P>
The downward route was different from the climb, and we reached the main
East Road in near-darkness, putting up at another inn with no conception of 
hot water, but a keen appreciation of ale and stew.
<P>
On the next day, breakfast was served in a large room, with open windows
along one side to a garden. Every alcove, shelf and side table was filled with
stuffed animals.  Among the smaller mammals and birds, there were a number
of extremely rare specimens. The Guide informed us that it was considered
good sport in this district only to kill animals and birds which were
useless for the table. Otherwise, what had been sport became mere farming.
"For our part," the Bosun replied, "My countrymen have always considered it ignoble 
to kill game that cannot be eaten". The Guide agreed, but reminded us that
England was famous for hunting the fox but he had heard that we did not eat it. 
Moreover, he did not agree that fox-hunting was a form of pest control, as
too many people appeared to take pleasure in the activity. As ever, the
Guide's remarks were novel and thought-provoking.
<P>
In addition to the animals which were the product of the taxidermist's art,
there were a number	of birds engaged in saving the taxidermist trouble
by stuffing themselves with any portions of our breakfast which we did not
vigorously defend. These lively winged buccaneers perched indiscriminately on the
preserved corpses of their fellows, without any appearance of dread or
respect, and the Boy to this day swears there was a blackbird's nest in
the gaping snarl of a stuffed wolf.
<P>
We completed the remaining distance to Arvendel (<i>Tolkien's Rivendell. Ed.</i>)
before nightfall. The journey took us through farmlands and over the Bruinen 
River by a much-patched wooden bridge, then the road climbed steeply into
trees, over several mountain torrents, including one very large one, and
finally to the village of Arvendel, perched on a green, wooded shoulder of
the surrounding mountains.
<P>
The feeling of peace and goodwill emanating from the very stones of this
hamlet filled the Bosun, the Boy and the Scholar with warmth and comfort, 
and the small inn
was the best we had yet visited.  Nevertheless, the Guide
seemed ill-at-ease, and would not tarry, preferring instead to camp on the 
hillside above the village, on the other side of the river, which he
crossed by the railway bridge. He left hurriedly, saying his tribe was
unwelcome in this place, though, in truth, none of the inhabitants had paid the
slightest attention to him. He promised to return for us in the morning.
