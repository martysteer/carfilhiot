The Old Forest
</H3>
<H4>
The day after the travellers reached Greyhaven, which was obviously 
nearly as much of an eyesore then as it is today, they
sent the canoes and most of their supplies ahead by rail to Carrock 
(a village on the Anduin River).
<P>
They then turned to the problem of a local guide, not so much to find the 
way as to recommend more scenic routes,
identify historical sites, translate where necessary and advise
them on local habits & customs. From a small group
of apparently totally unsuitable candidates fielded by Carlton-Browne, 
they chose the least unacceptable - a man called
Treblig. They had planned to rent horses for the journey to
Carrock, and then to send them back to Greyhaven with the guide. This
proved impossible, as no stable was prepared to believe in the safe
return of their horses, and demanded a surety deposit so large that
the travellers couldn't have afforded it. The Boy's expertise in 
horseflesh was brought 
into play and they bought five of the sturdy local ponies instead.
<P>
The first part of the journey was uneventful, though the Scholar
deplores the industrialisation of the chalk downs area from Greyhaven to
Banakran (the town that Tolkien calls Hobbiton - basically, Banakran 
means "the place of the halflings). They made two overnight stops en route 
from Greyhaven to Banakran.
<P>
Interestingly, the travellers were shown the remains of what Treblig called
"The Ancient Grey Towers" - the remains,
as The Boy remarked, being <i>"reminiscent of a very small quantity of
medium-sized white stones, placed in rings on the roadside,
much less impressive than Stonehenge, and, indeed, less
impressive than the coal house in my garden in London"</i>.
<P>
Today, a century later, the countryside is somewhat restored,
except for urban sprawl and the carefully preserved ruins of early
factories (this is called Industrial Archaeology), but there 
is now a deplorable nuclear re-processing plant on the hill above Banakran. 
<P>
They spent the night at a passable inn near Banakran, having been
shown, with great reverence, a "Mallorn Tree", of which the Scholar, 
who seems to know a thing
or two about natural history, writes that he 
recognised it as <i>"a species of
Eucalyptus, though a Eucalyptus of great age and size"</i>.  The tree
is no longer there, so we will never know whether Treblig's Mallorn
was a mysterious (and very early) import from Australia or some 
now-extinct native species.
<P>
In the evening, the town was lit by a magnificent fireworks
display, <i>"... the likes of which we have never seen, with dragons,
horses, heroes and castles of light hanging in the air
above the town for minutes at a time"</i>. 
<P>
At the first opportunity on the following day, they requested their 
guide to leave the main road 
and travel parallel to and south of it so as to be away from the main
road and the railway line that ran alongside of it. Treblig was reluctant 
to stray from the beaten track. It was pointed out to him that there was 
no benefit to the travellers to be shown
the way along a well-travelled, partly-paved, signposted road, but
Treblig only agreed to follow the narrow lanes through Suza (which Tolkien
calls "the Shire") under threat of dismissal.
<P>
We pick up the story as they approach the Brandwyn (Baranduin) River.

The Old Forest
</H3>
<H4>
Treblig continued to grumble about the diversion we were taking,
making grave predictions that we might have to retrace our steps.
We were now travelling east, however, just as we had desired, and
I offered him the map, which clearly showed at least two crossings
of the Brandwyn River south of the East Road. He paid the map scant 
attention, and I concluded that it meant little or nothing
to him.
<P>
"You seem to have some reason to avoid this area," I suggested.
<P>
"Master, here we are safe but slow. In the Forest is no road,
many dangers,
so we must use East Road anyway. Wasting time here. No history
to look at."
<P>
The Bosun rode up and asked what we were talking about.
<P>
I said, "He seems to think that this part of Suza is acceptable, 
though lacking in interest. However, he feels the Old Forest is 
well-nigh impassible, and we'll be forced north to the East
Road. However, the map shows crossings of the river south of the
road, and I think we ought to have a look at the Forest, anyway.
We didn't come here to walk along the highway. There are certain
to be game paths through the woods, and we have a compass!"
<P>
The countryside here was not significantly different to the English 
countryside. However, Treblig occasionally pointed out to us
homes that were carved into chalky hillsides. These were strange
and somehow incongruous, as they were built like burrows,
yet they had circular doors in the
entrances, circular windows, and were often surrounded by
well-tended gardens. Treblig told us that these houses 
(he called them a word that sounded like <i>smiles</i>)
were traditional in the area. Once, apparently, only <i>halflings</i>
used them, but now they were fashionable with dwarves and men.
We could not discern the distinction he made between dwarves
and <i>halflings</i>. Both were of small stature, both were at
home underground, but where Suza had once been a domain exclusively
of <i>halflings</i>, it was now inhabited by men and dwarves, and 
<i>halflings</i> (or <i>hobbits</i>) were always shy,
inconspicuous creatures, and never seen in Middle Earth today.
In truth, we seldom saw anyone in the lanes of Suza. I think
we passed two men on horseback, a girl on a pony, a pair of
dwarves digging the entrance to a new <i>smile</i> and an old
lady tending her garden, all of whom nodded solemnly and politely,
then stared after us as we rode past.

In due course, we emerged from the country lanes on to a ridge 
above the flood plain of the Brandwyn. Below us was a village
called Stock, according to the map, and on the far side of
Stock, the Stockbridge across the Brandwyn. Beyond the river, 
the dark line of the Forest	stretched north and south as far as the 
eye could see. The road we were on wound down into the valley
and entered Stock.
<P>
It being late, we put up for the night at the inn in Stock.
With some relief, we ate the best meal and drank the best beer
we had been offered in Middle Earth to date, and agreed that
<i>The Dragon Smaug</i>, as the inn was called, would bear
comparison with <i>The Cockpit</i> in Eton, where we had
dined when we planned our adventure. (<i>The Cockpit in
Eton is </i>still<i> an excellent Restaurant, though you can
no longer sleep there - not, at any rate, overnight - Ed.</i>)
<P>
In the morning we rose very early. When we gained the
road, Treblig again attempted to lead us North to the
Branbuck Bridge on the East Road, but we paid him no heed,
and made our way to the Stock bridge, a little east of the village.
When I had made a photograph of the Brandwyn and the Old Forest
beyond, there ensued a comical scene in which Treblig first refused to
cross the bridge, predicting dire consequences (which foreboding
later turned out to be justified), and then dismounted and set 
off by himself back up the road to Banakran calling on us to follow. 
We debated briefly whether to let him go (he had received no pay
so far, and had left behind the pony with which we had provided him)
or to ride after him and try to fetch him back. I was the only one of 
us who was interested in retaining his services, but I had no
compelling reason to give the others who were both pleased to be rid
of him. Yet before we reached a conclusion, he came running back,
mounted his pony, and rode swiftly across the bridge. Before we
followed, the Bosun remarked that a strange figure had just
appeared on the ridge we had crossed the previous day. The Boy studied
the figure through his spy-glass, but could see little at this range.
He remarked on the figure's long-limbed gait, and we could not fail to 
link Treblig's change of mind to the stranger's appearance.
<P>
From that moment onwards, Treblig behaved in a strange and
frightened fashion, to such an extent that the Boy dubbed him
"Trembling". He flinched every time a sheep bleated or a marsh 
bird cried, and when a donkey, hidden behind a high hedge,
brayed a greeting to our party as we passed, Trembling nearly
collapsed with fear, so that we could not help but laugh out
loud at the terrified expression on his face. Yet in contrast to his 
reluctant air of the previous day, he made haste to guide us
to the Forest Gate, a strange tunnel that penetrates the 
apparently continuous hedge of trees, emerging into the cool
darkness of a dense forest. The silence was near-total, there
were no birds, no squirrels. Strangely, the pathway from the 
Gate ended abruptly a few furlongs into the forest, and we
were constrained to make our way through the trees as best we could.
<P>
This became so uncomfortable that we were forced to admit that 
Treblig might have been correct, and that we should have 
avoided the forest. Dignity argued that we not admit this, and we
plodded onwards, until it would hardly have been worth turning
back, even supposing we could have retraced our steps to the Gate.
Treblig kept glancing around nervously, and made no attempt to
show us the way. It is 
hard to remember how long we proceeded in this fashion,
with the Bosun cursing that his pipe refused to light, the
Boy complaining that his mount was trying to scrape him off on 
the overhanging branches, Treblig whining a refrain to the effect
of "Told you so", and I have no doubt my own sweet temper was
somewhat in jeopardy.

Eventually, I proposed that we try to turn north and 
work our way through to the East Road.
The Old Forest had an alternative suggestion, which it made
known to us by placing the thickest briars between us and the
north, and placing difficult ridges in that direction also.
However difficult, it was easier to continue eastwards. 
<P>
In fact, as soon as we decided to cease the struggle to reach the East
Road, the going became easier, and the vestige of a trail 
became visible. We made much better progress from this point onward,
and emerged in what was early afternoon in a clear area at the 
bank of a stream.
In this pleasant spot, we set the ponies to graze.
The Bosun assembled his smallest rod, and vainly attempted to hoodwink a fish 
onto his line. We gave him a quarter-hour and then ate the cold	ham
we had brought from the <i>Dragon Smaug</i>. In any event, the Boy failed 
to persuade his camp fire to light, so we would have been eating raw
fish, just as we drank cold water instead of tea.
<P>
After lunch, the Bosun continued to try his luck with the local
fish, while the Boy and I attempted to light the camp fire.  I
could not even light the oil lamp, which we had hoped to use
to start the fire. Though there seemed nothing wrong with it,
it would not light for us that day, yet it worked perfectly for the rest 
of the trip. Since returning from Middle Earth, I have written a letter of 
complaint to the makers.
We three were so engrossed that we did not remark Treblig's 
departure, but depart he did, and disappeared from human ken, by all
accounts. He did not ride away, as all the ponies were still
present. He even left a good pair of boots by the foot of a large willow
tree, though we never realised he had a spare pair. He did not
drown because the stream was too small to wash a body away. No-one
heard him go. Indeed, the Bosun had noticed him sleeping where we
later found his boots. We searched for him and called for a
very long time, several minutes, at any rate, without result.  
<P>
At last, we crossed the stream and continued our journey, still
heading east along a well-defined trail. We met no-one, nor
was there any evidence of other travellers on the trail,
the only footprints and hoofprints being those our own party
left behind.
As night fell, we emerged from the Forest, having covered some
fifty miles since early dawn, onto a bleak heathland dotted
with bare, low hills. We turned north with relief, hoping to
reach the East Road before dark.
It was not to be. As light failed, we climbed a conical hill
in order to see as far as possible, but there was no sign
of the road in the gathering darkness. The hill had a 
hollow in its top, like a volcano. It was covered with soft
grass and springy heather, and there were a few standing
stones in the centre of the depression. We made camp, ate
a cold supper and
passed an uneventful night, though the ponies spent the
dark hours in constant agitation. 
<P>
On the following morning, however, we found ourselves in rather a pickle. 
We awoke to a thick and clammy mist,
and I immediately realised that I could not find my compass, though 
I had fallen asleep with it in my jacket pocket.  Neither the Bosun 
nor the Boy could
find their compasses either. Someone or other, perhaps Treblig,
had robbed us of the means to find our way out of this 
wilderness.	A number of other items were missing. They had in
common the fact that they were small, and made of bright metal,
such as the Bosun's pipe-scraping instrument, and the Boy's
pocket watch which he said was no loss, since it had cost
only a few shillings and had not kept good time ever since he had
consulted it during a rainstorm in Edinburgh.
<P>
"In fact," he said, "I hope the thief uses it to keep an important
appointment, as he will arrive either unfashionably early, attracting
scorn and mockery, or hopelessly late, causing him to be shunned
by his peers."
<P>
We hoped the mist would lift, but it did not. We would not be able to
navigate by line of sight in this. However, the mist was lighter to the
East where the sun was, and the Boy proposed that
we make a start in the approximate direction of north, keeping the
hazy illumination to our right, and using a simple method
of staying in a straight line, even if we made little
progress. At the foot of the hill it was thicker than ever. We
could no longer be sure of the direction of the sun, and within
five minutes, we had lost each other three times, and even when we
gave up the effort and climbed the hill again, it turned out 
not to be our hill, but a ridge.  
<P>
Nothing daunted, we started to make preparations for a cup of tea,
lighting a fire easily on this occasion. We were cheerful enough.
The mist could not last for ever, surely. Suddenly, a deep, harsh
voice spoke from the mist, "Have you a cup of tea for a fellow traveller?"
<P>
I started up as a tall, lanky figure stepped into the small circle
of visibility. This fellow was the stuff of nightmares. He was
black - not the black of your African, nor yet of the Hindoo,
nor even the Tamil, but the hard, shiny, black of a beetle. His
long head, pointed at the crown and chin, was preceded by a nose
like a beak, triangular, and broad at the base. His yellow
teeth as he smiled his greeting to us were large and sharp, and
even when his mouth was closed, four fangs projected, two upwards
and two downwards. His hands and feet were large and muscular, his
limbs long and sinewy. He wore only a tight leather coat which I
never saw him remove, and, though he walked barefoot, you could
hear his feet click on the stones, so hard were they.  He carried only
a makeshift cage, containing a hen.
<P>
"May I introduce myself? I am Hrkwssfpih, which means Devil Spit in
my language. I am of the Uruk-Hai, a noble warrior clan, but I mean
you no harm." The name 'Hrkwssfpih' is written phonetically. I have no
idea of the proper spelling.
<P>
He was evidently used to the effect his appearance had upon strangers,
and made some effort to be reassuring, sitting down and showing
his teeth in an unintentionally menacing smile. Being gentlemanly
Britons, we were at pains not to seem churlish, introduced 
ourselves, proferred tea, and so on. All the while, he chattered
on in his harsh voice, commenting on the weather, our ponies,
the quality of the tea (which was, indeed, the very best Ceylon)
despite the lack of milk,
and showing an excellent command of the English language, though
his sibilants were affected by his fangs, so that he lisped in
an incongruous manner.
<P>
"And what brings you here, Mr ...?" I asked, at last.
<P>
"Hrkwssfpih. I am anxious to be of service to you gentlemen. For a fee,
of course. I am offering to be your guide, as I am temporarily
without employment, and I see that your fellow has deserted you." 
<P>
My immediate thought was that he knew we were in a difficult
situation. It was obviously none other than Hrkwssfpih who had
terrified the unfortunate Treblig by his appearance on the ridge
above the river the previous day, and, for all we knew, he
may have done away with the poor devil. Perhaps, also, it
had been he who had stolen our compasses and other trinkets.
Now, I assumed, he was about to hold us to ransom with a
steep demand. Before I could speak, however, he suggested a figure 
which, though nearly double what Treblig had asked, would 
not have satisfied a street sweeper in England. I exchanged
a glance with the Bosun and the Boy, then agreed.
<P>
"On one condition. That we may call you 'Guide', rather than
your given name, as I think we may bite our tongues in the attempt."
<P>
"A small sacrifice", he replied. "Though Hrkwssfpih is a noble name, Guide
is a noble occupation." Then he solemnly shook hands with each
of us in turn. It felt like gripping the hand of a bronze statue.
<P>
"So, Guide", said the Bosun, "Pray guide us to the East Road, as
we are anxious to reach Bree, and our compasses have all gone
missing."
<P>
"The Barrow Wights are fascinated by magnetic articles," remarked
the Guide, mysteriously. This was the first of many mysterious
statements from the Guide, some of which I have remembered well
enough to record. Then he raised his head, drew a deep breath through
his huge nostrils, and suggested we pack away our picnic.
<P>
At the Guide's request, we connected the ponies head to tail,
and he set off, leading the first one with a long rope. He
refused to mount, saying that he had little love for 
ponies, and, in truth, they avoided him too, when they could.
I never saw him touch a pony, and they seemed not to like the smell
of him, though, to us, he was odourless, in total contrast,
as the Boy remarked, to the Bosun's socks.
<P>
I had some misgivings at the trust we had shown in the Guide,
at a very short acquaintance and no proper introduction. These 
misgivings were not allayed by the fact that I could not see
further than the pony's ear in this fog and there was a constant 
sensation of turning in a circle, aniti-clockwise. The terrain
was uneven, and we seemed to climb and descend constantly. Yet the
most disturbing thing, and we all experienced it, was the
sensation that we were passing among a multitude. There were
murmurs of conversation from all sides, footsteps, little
cries and the tinkle of metal against metal. From time to
time, an almost palpable skein of fog would touch
the face or hand, imparting a chill, sometimes
accompanied by the sound of a whisper. The Guide later
told us that we had been passing among the ghosts of the Barrow Downs,
a typical folk-tale response,
but I feel it is much more likely that the weather conditions and
landscape conspired to cause strange echoes of our own
passage to be reflected and magnified back at us. Nevertheless,
at the time, it was most eerie, and we were indeed relieved to
emerge from the fog onto a heathland, with the road in front
of us. I turned to look at the fog which stood like a wall
behind us. It was most unnatural how it withstood the noonday
sun now beating on the road.
<P>
We made a small fire, and lunched beside the road. The Guide accepted
our tea, but, in a scene rather shocking to we three, he swiftly
removed the hen from its cage, bit off its head, skinned
and gutted it expertly with his bare hands, and offered us
some. Like gentlemen, we pretended not to be perturbed, though the
sight of these teeth in action had induced a chill.
We declined, the Bosun remarking politely that there was nothing like a
good fresh chicken for a snack. The Guide agreed, devouring
the bird raw, bones and all.
<P>
We became used to his eating habits in subsequent days, and
he explained them as follows. 
<P>
The well-being of his food was important to him.
The creatures he ate, mostly chickens, rabbits and other
small game, were kept in a healthy state 
until he ate them, and their
end came to them swiftly and unexpectedly. The meat thus obtained
was fresh, tender and healthy. He was particularly
prone to ascribe all infection to quality of food and
drink, and it is true to say that he never had a day's
illness in our company.
<P>
The journey to Bree was uneventful and swift, and we put up
at the Inn of the Prancing Pony, a most wonderful establishment,
sprawling across several acres of Bree, with a convivial
dining and drinking hall of heroic proportions, which seems
permanently filled with interesting people from all over
Middle Earth, including a number of folk of small stature
who were identified to us as <i>halflings</i> and a small
group of the Guide's race, who seemed no less friendly
than our own man, but were referred to as <i>"Yorks"</i>
(a phonetic rendering) and shunned by everyone, which is the
fate, as the Boy remarked, of all who originate in Yorkshire.
<P>
At dinner that evening, we four sat together, and the Guide
told us his history, that of his clan and of times ancient
beyond understanding, most of it sheer fabrication, I am
sure, though I have recorded what I noted and remembered of 
his tales that night and later, and will write a book on
the subject, so that we do not confuse the present factual account
of our travels with mythology. (<i>This book was written, and
submitted to several publishers, all of whom rejected it.
I hope, eventually, to turn up the manuscript from one of these,
as it is not among the papers
I have obtained from Grimfield's heirs. Ed.</i>)
<P>
On subsequent evenings, for we remained four days at Bree in that
comfortable atmosphere, we ourselves were the <i>raconteurs</i>,
surrounded by locals and visitors as we told of our travelling,
soldiering and maritime adventures.
