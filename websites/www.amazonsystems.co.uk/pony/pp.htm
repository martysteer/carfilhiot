Preface to the WWW Edition
</H3>
<H4>
Amazon Systems are delighted to bring to you the world wide
web edition
of <I>"Tales from the Prancing Pony"</I> by A. Scholar.  These extracts
give a flavour of the complete work which is no longer
available except, perhaps, from the antiquarian booksellers.
I inherited my copy, the original publisher having been one
of my ancestors!
<P>
This unique book has been published only once before,
in a limited edition in 1888, and is an account of a four-month vacation 
in Middle Earth by a trio of British gentlemen in the Summer of
1886.
<P>
It should be of considerable interest to lovers of J.R.R.Tolkien's
<i>Hobbit</i> and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, and students of
Tolkien's work will be fascinated by this comparatively contemporary 
account of what often seems a mythical region of the World.
<P>
<i>Legal stuff
<br>
Amazon Systems have obtained the rights to this important book,
and are publishing it on the Internet for the entertainment of
readers.  Any attempt to re-distribute this document, or to use the 
document or any of its contents for profit, will be treated as
violation of copyright, and may result in a number of lawyers
appearing on the culprit's doorstep or at the address of his ISP.

The Expedition Members
</H3>
<H4>
Clues as to the identities of the travellers are provided within
the book, though they are officially anonymous.
<P>
A. Scholar is immediately recognisable as a pseudonym.  The author,
referred to in the text as The Scholar, is now known to have
been W. M. Grimfield,
who was at the time an Assistant Secretary at the Foreign
Office. Little is known of his history, and the few books he
wrote are now becoming collectors' items, especially because of
the excellent photographs he took.
<P>
Grimfield was educated at Eton and St. Andrew's, where his Chemistry tutor 
once noted, "I have taught this student all I know, yet he is keen to learn
more. I suspect he will become a famous researcher."  Yet, when Grimfield 
graduated, the only branches of science that he was concerned about
were those connected with photography.  He joined the Foreign Office,
expecting to spend much of his time abroad, yet, like many Civil
Servants at the FO, he found himself anchored in London
and his vacations, rather than his work, were
what took him abroad.  He participated in a number of amateur
expeditions, most of them self-financed.

<H4>
The Bosun was
Lieutenant Arthur Nettleton of the Royal Navy, who later commanded HMS
Stalwart, and retired in 1923 as a Rear Admiral. 
<P>
According to his grand-daughter, Mrs Penelope Field, he seldom spoke of 
his expedition to Middle Earth, though his possession of a copy of the 
book, inscribed <i>"To the Bosun from the Scholar"</i>, confirms the Bosun's 
identity beyond reasonable doubt. In addition, Mrs Field owns a number of
photographs of the expedition members which were among the Rear Admiral's
possessions.
<P>
As to the remainder of his career, he seems to have spent most of
his service life at sea, rather than at an Admiralty desk.
He achieved regular promotion in a Royal Navy which was seldom out
of the firing line during his entire service with it.
<P>
As was typical of the British Empire at the time, he spent a brief
period in mid-career as the Military Governor of a Pacific island group, 
and on his retirement from the Royal Navy, spent his last few years
as a respected official of sorts in the British West Indies.

<H4>
The third member of the
group, The Boy, may have been Major Keith McAllister MC of the
Highland Light Infantry, as it is known that he participated in one of
Grimfield's earlier expeditions.  McAllister was later knighted and,
as General Sir Keith McAllister, was killed in Belgium during the
First World War. 
<P>
It is known that McAllister's family originated in Prestonpans, a
village near Edinburgh, Scotland, where a famous battle of
the Jacobite rebellion took place in the eighteenth century.
His family owned fishing boats operating from the 
nearby harbour of Cockenzie. His distaste for sea-faring,
frequently communicated to friends, was the spur which
drove him to become a soldier, and The Boy's discomfort
afloat, as related by Grimfield, lends credence to my contention that
The Boy and McAllister are one and the same.
<P>
McAllister served in India, the Crimea and South Africa, as well
as Belgium.
<P>
His mountaineering feats include an early, if not the first,
ascent by a non-African of Kilimanjaro; a record-breaking series
of Alpine peaks climbed over a two-week period in 1883; and
participation in an early Army-based Himalayan expedition which had the bad luck 
to encounter unseasonable weather which resulted in the death
of half the expedition members.

Some Background to the Book
</H3>
<H4>
The reason for pseudonymous authorship
may be related to the participants' relationships to the British
Government.  It might have been considered indelicate for an official
of the Foreign Office (Assistant Secretary, then, as now, being a much
more senior post than it sounds) and two officers of Her Majesty's
Armed Forces to be travelling in a country with which Great Britain had
neither diplomatic links nor imperial ties, and with which she was
officially at war, due to treaty obligations, though nothing more
belligerent than a reciprocal trade embargo was undertaken.
Indeed, it may well be that the trip was undertaken with official
encouragement in prospect of its findings becoming valuable to
Great Britain.
<P>
From our modern point of view, the interesting feature is that this is
an account of Middle Earth in the late nineteenth century.  Middle Earth
no longer exists as a single country. In addition the account is
presented by an author who certainly never had the opportunity to read
J.R.R.Tolkien's books, because they were
published more than half a century later, and probably had no knowledge
of the Red Book of Westmarch upon which Tolkien drew for much of his
narrative. Conversely, it appears unlikely that
Tolkien ever discovered "Tales from the Prancing Pony" - certainly, it is
never mentioned in Tolkien's letters and other writings.
<P>
Another remarkable feature is that the book 
contains a number of photographs. 
Grimfield was a highly regarded amateur photographer (<I>The
Compleat Photographer - W. M. Grimfield - Cassel - 1889</I>).
Photographic illustration was very rare at the time.  Most books were
illustrated, if at all,
exclusively by engravings, some of them prepared from photographs,
but manually traced and engraved. This was one of the first books to
have had photographs directly reproduced in it.    
The process was called <i>Platinotype</i>. 
The illustrations in the book were
separately prepared and presented as separate sheets, glued into place.
The complication and cost
of this process probably accounts for the scarcity of the book today, as
less than a thousand copies may have been printed.
Also, commercial manufacture of gelatin-coated dry photographic plates
had just begun, and, for the first time, the photographer did not
need to have a darkroom and laboratory within easy reach, but could
carry the plates with him for some time.
<P>
In any case, in addition to being an interesting sidelight on the Middle
Earth of Tolkien's tales, the book has merit in itself, as you will
discover.
<P>
In particular, the place names that Tolkien uses in the Shire - indeed the
name "Shire" itself - are Anglicisations of the real names.  Tolkien makes
this clear in one of the Appendices to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.
On my first editing of the book for web use, I used Tolkien's 
English-sounding names, but I was forced, then, to take liberties with
the maps, and I have revised this policy, returning to the local
names as used in <i>The Prancing Pony</i>, and to the original maps
reproduced in the book.
<p>
The <i>Prancing Pony</i> of the title is the actual name of the Inn in Bree that 
also appears in Tolkien's <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i>. Although this
is clearly an English name, it has been in use since medieval days, and 
it has no native name. I am
told that a Heritage Motel of the same name still exists on the site.
Another exception is the port of Gr&aring;havn, actually a Norse,
rather than a native, name, which foreigners have long called "Greyhaven".

Introduction
</H3>
<H4>
My two companions tell me it was my idea to take a trip to Middle Earth,
and, on balance, I am prepared to take the blame, as, for the most part,
we had a very enjoyable time there. 
<P>
The Bosun is always keen to explore
rivers and lakes with a view to catching any fish which might be
sufficiently incautious as to take one of his carefully
designed and constructed flies and nymphs, and he
hoped that the fish of Middle Earth, having been spared these delights
until now, might be less critical that the denizens of our English
waterways which had been spurning his offerings all year. In addition,
though his occupation brings him into contact with the sea, he felt that
he spent too little time
splashing around in water, and saw our expedition as an opportunity to
get thoroughly wet on a regular basis, which objective we all achieved.
<P>
The Boy, so	called for his fresh-faced, youthful looks, enjoys nothing
better than	strolling up an Alp, surveying the clouds from above, and
descending again in time for supper. He swore that he had ascended all
the Alps that were worth scaling, as well as Kilimanjaro and a small
Himalaya (which	adventure he found insufferably cold), and
that he would appreciate a change of cloud to inspect. His penchant for
embarking on these expeditions with no more specialist equipment than his
warm tweed jacket, a pair of stout walking shoes and a packed lunch may
yet lead him into trouble. Accordingly, the Bosun and I felt a
responsibility to shield him from his own spirit of lone endeavour by
accompanying him at least to the foothills of his next ascent.
<P>
As the Scholar of the party, I am interested in the sport
of observing my fellow creatures, human and animal, which I can do
equally well almost anywhere that creatures may be found.  And so it was
decided	that Middle Earth should be offered the privilege of our presence
in the Summer of 1886.
<P>
Our plan was to sail from Harwich to Greyhaven, and thence to proceed to
Tolfalas, by travelling east to the River Anduin, and navigating 
downstream to the sea in a generally southward direction, with occasional
excursions to places of interest.  The first, eastward part of the
journey would be undertaken mainly on horseback. The second,
on the Anduin, was to be in our own canoes, a new variety imported from Canada 
and only recently available in London. The Bosun, having been on a journey
through Norway using such a vessel, recommended them thoroughly for their
sea-worthiness, lightness of weight and suitability in fast-moving,
shallow rivers and on lakes. The Boy and I suspected they were also
suitable for fishing, but the Bosun did not find it necessary to add
this.

Geography 
</H3>
<H4> 
A number of crude maps are included, sufficient to
illustrate our travels. Readers with an interest in mere topographical
accuracy would do well to treat these with some caution, and should
purchase John Bartholomew and Son's
excellent map of the country, just as we did. It was notable, however,
that while the printed map of Middle Earth shows all the principal towns,
coach roads and railway lines, it omits many of the paths still used by
travellers on foot and on horseback, and makes no reference to some of
the more prominent landmarks.

History
</H3>
<H4>
We made a serious attempt to obtain a comprehensive history of 
Middle Earth in English before our departure. This proved
impossible, and it is now our belief 
that no such volume	exists. 
<P>
Middle Earth's recent history has been a model of peace, without
external wars or civil commotion. Napoleon's brief occupation of
the Northern regions did
little more than introduce a few modern devices such as a 
University, some roads, the telegraph
and a postal service into the country.
Subsequent trade contact with England, France and Germany has resulted 
in improved port facilities and some railways, but Middle Earth is
both wealthy and self-sufficient, and has avoided close cultural contact
with external nations.
<P>  
In the matter of Middle Earth's pre-medieval history, since it is difficult 
to separate that subject from Myth, I shall restrict myself to 
reporting only what we were told and
what we saw and shall leave the reader to judge its veracity. Suffice to
say that we heard and saw much to excite our imaginations.
<P> 
<H3>  
Language
</H3>
Many languages are spoken in Middle Earth, and at least two alphabets
or scripts are used besides Roman. These dialects may be compared in 
importance to the Irish, Welsh and
Scottish Gaelic languages in Great Britain or to the Basque language 
in Northern Spain. Among the folk who originated these languages,
they are spoken almost exclusively. Our party spoke none of the
native languages.
<P>
Fortunately for us, the principal language of commerce is English, and many
inhabitants speak German or French. However, words from the many native 
dialects are used in day-to-day speech, even in English. I shall endeavour
not to trouble the reader with too much lingual authenticity.
Where I use a native word in this
book, it will be because there is no direct equivalent in English, and I
shall take care to define it before use.
