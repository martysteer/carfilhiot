<DIV class="descauthor">A Review by Joe Barlow<BR>

<DIV class="descstarring">STARRING: <i>Giovanni Ribisi, Natasha Wagner<p></i>DIRECTOR:  <i>Jesse Peretz<p></i>WRITER:    <i>Jesse Peretz  (based on the short story by Ian McEwan)<p></i>RATED:      <i>R<p></i>RELEASED: <i>1997</i></DIV><P>
One of the reasons I dearly love independent cinema is the fact that it often breaks the rules of Hollywood, which state that a film must include an all-star cast, car crashes, lots of special effects, and stunningly beautiful actors in order to make money.  With budgets approaching pocket change, many indie directors are breaking new ground in visual style by sidestepping these laws.  The downside?  Some filmmakers are a bit too eager to disregard rules that shouldn't be ignored. <i>First Love, Last Rites</i>, for instance, bypasses the notion that a movie should contain a coherent narrative.  It cheerfully tosses aside the thought that we should care about our characters.  It  laughs in the face of the idea that a movie should hold the audience's attention.  In short, <i>First Love, Last Rites</i> is a film that goes nowhere, and is in absolutely no hurry to arrive. <p> The story, such as it is, revolves around Joey (Giovanni Ribisi) and Sissel (Natasha Wagner), a young couple living together in a run-down shack in the swamplands of Louisiana.  What do they see in each other?  I have no idea.  Apart from the fact that neither of them are the least bit personable and always appear to be half-asleep, they seem to have nothing in common.  Oh, I take that back: they both love sex.  Approximately a third of the film features the pair boinking like rabbits. <p> Sissel's creepy father soon befriends Joey, and they talk at great length about nothing very interesting.  Eventually, they decide to start an eel-trapping business together.  A large portion of the film revolves around these plans, which are then completely abandoned for no discernable reason.  Sissel's dad also attempts to reconcile with his estranged wife by racing his car up and down her driveway.  No, I'm not making this up.  Vroom vroom, Romeo. <p> Towards the end of the film, Sissel actually begins to display some emotions towards Joey, all of which are negative.  She becomes moody, and boils her collection of 45 RPM records in a saucepan on the stove.  Why?  Again, I couldn't tell you.  She berates Joey, although he doesn't do anything except try to give her emotional support and reassurances of his love.  Oh, and we mustn't forget my favorite "stupid" moment: during one of their lovemaking marathons, Sissel begs Joey not to pull out of her; then, a couple of scenes later, she accuses him of trying to get her pregnant. "You're trying to put a baby inside me!" she shrieks.  Clearly Sissel is a stable, rational young woman, worthy of Joey's affections. <p> I'd like to describe the film's ending, but it doesn't really have one. Sure, there's a moment when celluloid is no longer running through the projector, but the final scene is purely ambiguous.  Pick any moment from the movie, and it would make just as much sense as the one chosen by the director.  A great film can have an ambiguous ending: Alfred Hitchcock's <i>The Birds</i>, for example, leaves things up in the air at its conclusion, and I found myself breathlessly wondering what the characters would do next. But despite the fact that <i>First Love, Last Rites</i> leaves a lot of unanswered questions when the credits begin to roll, I have not devoted one iota of thought to how they could be resolved.  I simply don't care, though I hope it involves Joey and Sissel both getting a swift kick in the rear. <p> <i>First Love, Last Rites</i> is a tedious viewing experience, full of bizarre symbolism (the rat in the wall), paper-thin characters, and scenes that make no sense whatsoever.  I've seen home movies that had a better storyline. Though the images of the Louisiana bayou are occasionally lovely, most of the visuals depict the interior of the squalid, rodent-infested house inhabited by our two main characters.  Only the music shines, capturing the flavor of the bayou in every scene.  Skip the film and check out the soundtrack instead--I wish <i>I</i> had. <p> One final note: the writer/director of this film is none other than Jesse Peretz, bass player for the alternative rock group The Lemonheads. I find it no small irony that a film that sucks this bad was made by someone who so freely associates with the sourest of fruits.   <P><B><center><br>RATING: * (out of a possible ****)</B>
