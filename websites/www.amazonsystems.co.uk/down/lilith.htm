<h1>Lilith</h1>

<p>by George MacDonald</p>

<p align="justify">I took a walk on Spaulding&#8217;s
Farm the other afternoon.&#160;  I saw the setting
sun lighting up the opposite side of a stately pine
wood.&#160; Its golden rays straggled into the aisles
of the wood as into some noble hall.&#160;  I was impressed
as if some ancient and altogether admirable and shining
family had settled there in that part of the land
called Concord, unknown to me,&#8212;&#173;to whom the
sun was servant,&#8212;&#173; who had not gone into
society in the village,&#8212;&#173;who had not been
called on.&#160;  I saw their park, their pleasure-ground,
beyond through the wood, in Spaulding&#8217;s cranberry-meadow.&#160;
 The pines furnished them with gables as they grew.&#160;
 Their house was not obvious to vision; their trees
grew through it.&#160;  I do not know whether I heard
the sounds of a suppressed hilarity or not.&#160; 
They seemed to recline on the sunbeams.&#160;  They
have sons and daughters.&#160;  They are quite well.&#160;
 The farmer&#8217;s cart-path, which leads directly
through their hall, does not in the least put them
out,&#8212;&#173;as the muddy bottom of a pool is sometimes
seen through the reflected skies.&#160;  They never
heard of Spaulding, and do not know that he is their
neighbor,&#8212;&#173;notwithstanding I heard him whistle
as he drove his team through the house.&#160;  Nothing
can equal the serenity of their lives.&#160;  Their
coat of arms is simply a lichen.&#160; I saw it painted
on the pines and oaks.&#160;  Their attics were in the
tops of the trees.&#160;  They are of no politics.&#160;
 There was no noise of labor.&#160; I did not perceive
that they were weaving or spinning.&#160;  Yet I did
detect, when the wind lulled and hearing was done away,
the finest imaginable sweet musical hum,&#8212;&#173;as
of a distant hive in May, which perchance was the
sound of their thinking.&#160;  They had no idle thoughts,
and no one without could see their work, for their
industry was not as in knots and excrescences embayed.</p>

<p align="justify">But I find it difficult to remember
them.&#160;  They fade irrevocably out of my mind even
now while I speak and endeavor to recall them, and
recollect myself.&#160;  It is only after a long and
serious effort to recollect my best thoughts that
I become again aware of their cohabitancy.&#160;  If
it were not for such families as this, I think I should
move out of Concord.</p>

<p>Thoreau:&#160; &#8220;WALKING.&#8221;</p>

<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>

<p><b>THE LIBRARY</b></p>

<p align="justify">I had just finished my studies at
Oxford, and was taking a brief holiday from work before
assuming definitely the management of the estate.&#160;
 My father died when I was yet a child; my mother followed
him within a year; and I was nearly as much alone in
the world as a man might find himself.</p>

<p align="justify">I had made little acquaintance with
the history of my ancestors.&#160; Almost the only
thing I knew concerning them was, that a notable number
of them had been given to study.&#160;  I had myself
so far inherited the tendency as to devote a good
deal of my time, though, I confess, after a somewhat
desultory fashion, to the physical sciences.&#160;
 It was chiefly the wonder they woke that drew me.&#160;
 I was constantly seeing, and on the outlook to see,
strange analogies, not only between the facts of different
sciences of the same order, or between physical and
metaphysical facts, but between physical hypotheses
and suggestions glimmering out of the metaphysical
dreams into which I was in the habit of falling.&#160;
 I was at the same time much given to a premature
indulgence of the impulse to turn hypothesis into
theory.&#160;  Of my mental peculiarities there is no
occasion to say more.</p>

<p align="justify">The house as well as the family was
of some antiquity, but no description of it is necessary
to the understanding of my narrative.&#160; It contained
a fine library, whose growth began before the invention
of printing, and had continued to my own time, greatly
influenced, of course, by changes of taste and pursuit.&#160;
 Nothing surely can more impress upon a man the transitory
nature of possession than his succeeding to an ancient
property!&#160;  Like a moving panorama mine has passed
from before many eyes, and is now slowly flitting from
before my own.</p>

<p align="justify">The library, although duly considered
in many alterations of the house and additions to
it, had nevertheless, like an encroaching state, absorbed
one room after another until it occupied the greater
part of the ground floor.&#160;  Its chief room was
large, and the walls of it were covered with books
almost to the ceiling; the rooms into which it overflowed
were of various sizes and shapes, and communicated
in modes as various&#8212;&#173;by doors, by open arches,
by short passages, by steps up and steps down.</p>

<p align="justify">In the great room I mainly spent my
time, reading books of science, old as well as new;
for the history of the human mind in relation to supposed
knowledge was what most of all interested me.&#160;
 Ptolemy, Dante, the two Bacons, and Boyle were even
more to me than Darwin or Maxwell, as so much nearer
the vanished van breaking into the dark of ignorance.</p>

<p align="justify">In the evening of a gloomy day of
August I was sitting in my usual place, my back to
one of the windows, reading.&#160;  It had rained the
greater part of the morning and afternoon, but just
as the sun was setting, the clouds parted in front
of him, and he shone into the room.&#160;  I rose and
looked out of the window.&#160;  In the centre of the
great lawn the feathering top of the fountain column
was filled with his red glory.&#160;  I turned to resume
my seat, when my eye was caught by the same glory
on the one picture in the room&#8212;&#173;a portrait,
in a sort of niche or little shrine sunk for it in
the expanse of book-filled shelves.&#160;  I knew it
as the likeness of one of my ancestors, but had never
even wondered why it hung there alone, and not in
the gallery, or one of the great rooms, among the other
family portraits.&#160;  The direct sunlight brought
out the painting wonderfully; for the first time I
seemed to see it, and for the first time it seemed
to respond to my look.&#160;  With my eyes full of
the light reflected from it, something, I cannot tell
what, made me turn and cast a glance to the farther
end of the room, when I saw, or seemed to see, a tall
figure reaching up a hand to a bookshelf.&#160; The
next instant, my vision apparently rectified by the
comparative dusk, I saw no one, and concluded that
my optic nerves had been momentarily affected from
within.</p>

<p align="justify">I resumed my reading, and would doubtless
have forgotten the vague, evanescent impression, had
it not been that, having occasion a moment after to
consult a certain volume, I found but a gap in the
row where it ought to have stood, and the same instant
remembered that just there I had seen, or fancied
I saw, the old man in search of a book.&#160;  I looked
all about the spot but in vain.&#160;  The next morning,
however, there it was, just where I had thought to
find it!&#160; I knew of no one in the house likely
to be interested in such a book.</p>

<p align="justify">Three days after, another and yet
odder thing took place.</p>

<p align="justify">In one of the walls was the low, narrow
door of a closet, containing some of the oldest and
rarest of the books.&#160;  It was a very thick door,
with a projecting frame, and it had been the fancy
of some ancestor to cross it with shallow shelves,
filled with book-backs only.&#160;  The harmless trick
may be excused by the fact that the titles on the
sham backs were either humorously original, or those
of books lost beyond hope of recovery.&#160;  I had
a great liking for the masked door.</p>

<p align="justify">To complete the illusion of it, some
inventive workman apparently had shoved in, on the
top of one of the rows, a part of a volume thin enough
to lie between it and the bottom of the next shelf:&#160;
he had cut away diagonally a considerable portion,
and fixed the remnant with one of its open corners
projecting beyond the book-backs.&#160;  The binding
of the mutilated volume was limp vellum, and one could
open the corner far enough to see that it was manuscript
upon parchment.</p>

<p align="justify">Happening, as I sat reading, to raise
my eyes from the page, my glance fell upon this door,
and at once I saw that the book described, if book
it may be called, was gone.&#160;  Angrier than any
worth I knew in it justified, I rang the bell, and
the butler appeared.&#160;  When I asked him if he
knew what had befallen it, he turned pale, and assured
me he did not.&#160;  I could less easily doubt his
word than my own eyes, for he had been all his life
in the family, and a more faithful servant never lived.&#160;
 He left on me the impression, nevertheless, that
he could have said something more.</p>

<p align="justify">In the afternoon I was again reading
in the library, and coming to a point which demanded
reflection, I lowered the book and let my eyes go
wandering.&#160;  The same moment I saw the back of
a slender old man, in a long, dark coat, shiny as
from much wear, in the act of disappearing through
the masked door into the closet beyond.&#160;  I darted
across the room, found the door shut, pulled it open,
looked into the closet, which had no other issue,
and, seeing nobody, concluded, not without uneasiness,
that I had had a recurrence of my former illusion,
and sat down again to my reading.</p>

<p align="justify">Naturally, however, I could not help
feeling a little nervous, and presently glancing up
to assure myself that I was indeed alone, started
again to my feet, and ran to the masked door&#8212;&#173;for
there was the mutilated volume in its place!&#160;
 I laid hold of it and pulled:&#160; it was firmly
fixed as usual!</p>

<p align="justify">I was now utterly bewildered.&#160;
 I rang the bell; the butler came; I told him all
I had seen, and he told me all he knew.</p>

<p align="justify">He had hoped, he said, that the old
gentleman was going to be forgotten; it was well no
one but myself had seen him.&#160;  He had heard a
good deal about him when first he served in the house,
but by degrees he had ceased to be mentioned, and
he had been very careful not to allude to him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The place was haunted by an
old gentleman, was it?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">He answered that at one time everybody
believed it, but the fact that I had never heard of
it seemed to imply that the thing had come to an end
and was forgotten.</p>

<p align="justify">I questioned him as to what he had
seen of the old gentleman.</p>

<p align="justify">He had never seen him, he said, although
he had been in the house from the day my father was
eight years old.&#160;  My grandfather would never
hear a word on the matter, declaring that whoever alluded
to it should be dismissed without a moment&#8217;s
warning:&#160; it was nothing but a pretext of the
maids, he said, for running into the arms of the men!
but old Sir Ralph believed in nothing he could not
see or lay hold of.&#160;  Not one of the maids ever
said she had seen the apparition, but a footman had
left the place because of it.</p>

<p align="justify">An ancient woman in the village had
told him a legend concerning a Mr. Raven, long time
librarian to &#8220;that Sir Upward whose portrait
hangs there among the books.&#8221;&#160;  Sir Upward
was a great reader, she said&#8212;&#173;not of such
books only as were wholesome for men to read, but
of strange, forbidden, and evil books; and in so doing,
Mr. Raven, who was probably the devil himself, encouraged
him.&#160;  Suddenly they both disappeared, and Sir
Upward was never after seen or heard of, but Mr. Raven
continued to show himself at uncertain intervals in
the library.&#160;  There were some who believed he
was not dead; but both he and the old woman held it
easier to believe that a dead man might revisit the
world he had left, than that one who went on living
for hundreds of years should be a man at all.</p>

<p align="justify">He had never heard that Mr. Raven
meddled with anything in the house, but he might perhaps
consider himself privileged in regard to the books.&#160;
 How the old woman had learned so much about him he
could not tell; but the description she gave of him
corresponded exactly with the figure I had just seen.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I hope it was but a friendly
call on the part of the old gentleman!&#8221; he concluded,
with a troubled smile.</p>

<p align="justify">I told him I had no objection to any
number of visits from Mr. Raven, but it would be well
he should keep to his resolution of saying nothing
about him to the servants.&#160;  Then I asked him if
he had ever seen the mutilated volume out of its place;
he answered that he never had, and had always thought
it a fixture.&#160;  With that he went to it, and gave
it a pull:&#160; it seemed immovable.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER II</h1>

<p><b>THE MIRROR</b></p>

<p align="justify">Nothing more happened for some days.&#160;
 I think it was about a week after, when what I have
now to tell took place.</p>

<p align="justify">I had often thought of the manuscript
fragment, and repeatedly tried to discover some way
of releasing it, but in vain:&#160; I could not find
out what held it fast.</p>

<p align="justify">But I had for some time intended a
thorough overhauling of the books in the closet, its
atmosphere causing me uneasiness as to their condition.&#160;
 One day the intention suddenly became a resolve, and
I was in the act of rising from my chair to make a
beginning, when I saw the old librarian moving from
the door of the closet toward the farther end of the
room.&#160;  I ought rather to say only that I caught
sight of something shadowy from which I received the
impression of a slight, stooping man, in a shabby dress-coat
reaching almost to his heels, the tails of which,
disparting a little as he walked, revealed thin legs
in black stockings, and large feet in wide, slipper-like
shoes.</p>

<p align="justify">At once I followed him:&#160; I might
be following a shadow, but I never doubted I was following
something.&#160;  He went out of the library into the
hall, and across to the foot of the great staircase,
then up the stairs to the first floor, where lay the
chief rooms.&#160;  Past these rooms, I following close,
he continued his way, through a wide corridor, to
the foot of a narrower stair leading to the second
floor.&#160;  Up that he went also, and when I reached
the top, strange as it may seem, I found myself in
a region almost unknown to me.&#160;  I never had brother
or sister to incite to such romps as make children
familiar with nook and cranny; I was a mere child
when my guardian took me away; and I had never seen
the house again until, about a month before, I returned
to take possession.</p>

<p align="justify">Through passage after passage we came
to a door at the bottom of a winding wooden stair,
which we ascended.&#160;  Every step creaked under
my foot, but I heard no sound from that of my guide.&#160;
 Somewhere in the middle of the stair I lost sight
of him, and from the top of it the shadowy shape was
nowhere visible.&#160;  I could not even imagine I
saw him.&#160;  The place was full of shadows, but he
was not one of them.</p>

<p align="justify">I was in the main garret, with huge
beams and rafters over my head, great spaces around
me, a door here and there in sight, and long vistas
whose gloom was thinned by a few lurking cobwebbed
windows and small dusky skylights.&#160;  I gazed with
a strange mingling of awe and pleasure:&#160; the wide
expanse of garret was my own, and unexplored!</p>

<p align="justify">In the middle of it stood an unpainted
inclosure of rough planks, the door of which was ajar.&#160;
 Thinking Mr. Raven might be there, I pushed the door,
and entered.</p>

<p align="justify">The small chamber was full of light,
but such as dwells in places deserted:&#160; it had
a dull, disconsolate look, as if it found itself of
no use, and regretted having come.&#160;  A few rather
dim sunrays, marking their track through the cloud
of motes that had just been stirred up, fell upon
a tall mirror with a dusty face, old-fashioned and
rather narrow&#8212;&#173;in appearance an ordinary
glass.&#160;  It had an ebony frame, on the top of
which stood a black eagle, with outstretched wings,
in his beak a golden chain, from whose end hung a black
ball.</p>

<p align="justify">I had been looking at rather than
into the mirror, when suddenly I became aware that
it reflected neither the chamber nor my own person.&#160;
 I have an impression of having seen the wall melt
away, but what followed is enough to account for any
uncertainty:&#8212;&#173;could I have mistaken for
a mirror the glass that protected a wonderful picture?</p>

<p align="justify">I saw before me a wild country, broken
and heathy.&#160;  Desolate hills of no great height,
but somehow of strange appearance, occupied the middle
distance; along the horizon stretched the tops of a
far-off mountain range; nearest me lay a tract of moorland,
flat and melancholy.</p>

<p align="justify">Being short-sighted, I stepped closer
to examine the texture of a stone in the immediate
foreground, and in the act espied, hopping toward
me with solemnity, a large and ancient raven, whose
purply black was here and there softened with gray.&#160;
 He seemed looking for worms as he came.&#160;  Nowise
astonished at the appearance of a live creature in
a picture, I took another step forward to see him
better, stumbled over something&#8212;&#173;doubtless
the frame of the mirror&#8212;&#173; and stood nose
to beak with the bird:&#160; I was in the open air,
on a houseless heath!</p>

<h1>CHAPTER III</h1>

<p><b>THE RAVEN</b></p>

<p align="justify">I turned and looked behind me:&#160;
all was vague and uncertain, as when one cannot distinguish
between fog and field, between cloud and mountain-side.&#160;
 One fact only was plain&#8212;&#173;that I saw nothing
I knew.&#160; Imagining myself involved in a visual
illusion, and that touch would correct sight, I stretched
my arms and felt about me, walking in this direction
and that, if haply, where I could see nothing, I might
yet come in contact with something; but my search was
vain.&#160; Instinctively then, as to the only living
thing near me, I turned to the raven, which stood
a little way off, regarding me with an expression
at once respectful and quizzical.&#160;  Then the absurdity
of seeking counsel from such a one struck me, and I
turned again, overwhelmed with bewilderment, not unmingled
with fear.&#160;  Had I wandered into a region where
both the material and psychical relations of our world
had ceased to hold?&#160;  Might a man at any moment
step beyond the realm of order, and become the sport
of the lawless?&#160;  Yet I saw the raven, felt the
ground under my feet, and heard a sound as of wind
in the lowly plants around me!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How <i>did</i> I get here?&#8221;
I said&#8212;&#173;apparently aloud, for the question
was immediately answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You came through the door,&#8221;
replied an odd, rather harsh voice.</p>

<p align="justify">I looked behind, then all about me,
but saw no human shape.&#160;  The terror that madness
might be at hand laid hold upon me:&#160; must I henceforth
place no confidence either in my senses or my consciousness?&#160;
 The same instant I knew it was the raven that had
spoken, for he stood looking up at me with an air of
waiting.&#160;  The sun was not shining, yet the bird
seemed to cast a shadow, and the shadow seemed part
of himself.</p>

<p align="justify">I beg my reader to aid me in the endeavour
to make myself intelligible&#8212;&#173;if here understanding
be indeed possible between us.&#160; I was in a world,
or call it a state of things, an economy of conditions,
an idea of existence, so little correspondent with
the ways and modes of this world&#8212;&#173;which
we are apt to think the only world, that the best
choice I can make of word or phrase is but an adumbration
of what I would convey.&#160;  I begin indeed to fear
that I have undertaken an impossibility, undertaken
to tell what I cannot tell because no speech at my
command will fit the forms in my mind.&#160;  Already
I have set down statements I would gladly change did
I know how to substitute a truer utterance; but as
often as I try to fit the reality with nearer words,
I find myself in danger of losing the things themselves,
and feel like one in process of awaking from a dream,
with the thing that seemed familiar gradually yet
swiftly changing through a succession of forms until
its very nature is no longer recognisable.</p>

<p align="justify">I bethought me that a bird capable
of addressing a man must have the right of a man to
a civil answer; perhaps, as a bird, even a greater
claim.</p>

<p align="justify">A tendency to croak caused a certain
roughness in his speech, but his voice was not disagreeable,
and what he said, although conveying little enlightenment,
did not sound rude.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not come through any door,&#8221; I rejoined.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I saw you come through it!&#8212;&#173;saw
you with my own ancient eyes!&#8221; asserted the
raven, positively but not disrespectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw any door!&#8221; I persisted.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; he returned;
&#8220;all the doors you had yet seen&#8212;&#173;and
you haven&#8217;t seen many&#8212;&#173;were doors in;
here you came upon a door out!&#160; The strange thing
to you,&#8221; he went on thoughtfully, &#8220;will
be, that the more doors you go out of, the farther
you get in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oblige me by telling me where I am.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is impossible.&#160;  You
know nothing about whereness.&#160;  The only way to
come to know where you are is to begin to make yourself
at home.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How am I to begin that where
everything is so strange?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By doing something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Anything; and the sooner you
begin the better! for until you are at home, you will
find it as difficult to get out as it is to get in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have, unfortunately, found
it too easy to get in; once out I shall not try again!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have stumbled in, and may,
possibly, stumble out again.&#160;  Whether you have
got in <i>unfortunately</i> remains to be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you never go out, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;When I please I do, but not
often, or for long.&#160;  Your world is such a half-baked
sort of place, it is at once so childish and so self-satisfied&#8212;&#173;in
fact, it is not sufficiently developed for an old
raven&#8212;&#173;at your service!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Am I wrong, then, in presuming
that a man is superior to a bird?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is as it may be.&#160;
 We do not waste our intellects in generalising, but
take man or bird as we find him.&#8212;&#173;I think
it is now my turn to ask you a question!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have the best of rights,&#8221;
I replied, &#8220;in the fact that you <i>can</i> do
so!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well answered!&#8221; he rejoined.&#160;
 &#8220;Tell me, then, who you are&#8212;&#173;if you
happen to know.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How should I help knowing?&#160;
 I am myself, and must know!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If you know you are yourself,
you know that you are not somebody else; but do you
know that you are yourself?&#160;  Are you sure you
are not your own father?&#8212;&#173;or, excuse me,
your own fool?&#8212;&#173;Who are you, pray?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I became at once aware that I could
give him no notion of who I was.&#160;  Indeed, who
was I?&#160; It would be no answer to say I was who!&#160;
Then I understood that I did not know myself, did not
know what I was, had no grounds on which to determine
that I was one and not another.&#160;  As for the name
I went by in my own world, I had forgotten it, and
did not care to recall it, for it meant nothing, and
what it might be was plainly of no consequence here.&#160;
 I had indeed almost forgotten that there it was a
custom for everybody to have a name!&#160; So I held
my peace, and it was my wisdom; for what should I say
to a creature such as this raven, who saw through
accident into entity?</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and tell
me who I am.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As he spoke, he turned his back, and
instantly I knew him.&#160;  He was no longer a raven,
but a man above the middle height with a stoop, very
thin, and wearing a long black tail-coat.&#160;  Again
he turned, and I saw him a raven.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have seen you before, sir,&#8221;
I said, feeling foolish rather than surprised.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How can you say so from seeing
me behind?&#8221; he rejoined.&#160;  &#8220;Did you
ever see yourself behind?&#160;  You have never seen
yourself at all!&#160; &#8212;&#173;Tell me now, then,
who I am.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I humbly beg your pardon,&#8221;
I answered:&#160; &#8220;I believe you were once the
librarian of our house, but more <i>who</i> I do not
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you beg my pardon?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because I took you for a raven,&#8221;
I said&#8212;&#173;seeing him before me as plainly
a raven as bird or man could look.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You did me no wrong,&#8221;
he returned.&#160;  &#8220;Calling me a raven, or thinking
me one, you allowed me existence, which is the sum
of what one can demand of his fellow-beings.&#160;
 Therefore, in return, I will give you a lesson:&#8212;&#173;No
one can say he is himself, until first he knows that
he <i>is</i>, and then what <i>himself</i> is.&#160;  In
fact, nobody is himself, and himself is nobody.&#160;
 There is more in it than you can see now, but not
more than you need to see.&#160;  You have, I fear,
got into this region too soon, but none the less you
must get to be at home in it; for home, as you may
or may not know, is the only place where you can go
out and in.&#160;  There are places you can go into,
and places you can go out of; but the one place, if
you do but find it, where you may go out and in both,
is home.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He turned to walk away, and again
I saw the librarian.&#160;  He did not appear to have
changed, only to have taken up his shadow.&#160;  I
know this seems nonsense, but I cannot help it.</p>

<p align="justify">I gazed after him until I saw him
no more; but whether distance hid him, or he disappeared
among the heather, I cannot tell.</p>

<p align="justify">Could it be that I was dead, I thought,
and did not know it?&#160;  Was I in what we used to
call the world beyond the grave? and must I wander
about seeking my place in it?&#160;  How was I to find
myself at home?&#160;  The raven said I must do something:&#160;
what could I do here?&#8212;&#173; And would that make
me somebody? for now, alas, I was nobody!</p>

<p align="justify">I took the way Mr. Raven had gone,
and went slowly after him.&#160; Presently I saw a
wood of tall slender pine-trees, and turned toward
it.&#160;  The odour of it met me on my way, and I made
haste to bury myself in it.</p>

<p align="justify">Plunged at length in its twilight
glooms, I spied before me something with a shine,
standing between two of the stems.&#160;  It had no
colour, but was like the translucent trembling of the
hot air that rises, in a radiant summer noon, from
the sun-baked ground, vibrant like the smitten chords
of a musical instrument.&#160;  What it was grew no
plainer as I went nearer, and when I came close up,
I ceased to see it, only the form and colour of the
trees beyond seemed strangely uncertain.&#160;  I would
have passed between the stems, but received a slight
shock, stumbled, and fell.&#160;  When I rose, I saw
before me the wooden wall of the garret chamber.&#160;
 I turned, and there was the mirror, on whose top
the black eagle seemed but that moment to have perched.</p>

<p align="justify">Terror seized me, and I fled.&#160;
 Outside the chamber the wide garret spaces had an
UNCANNY look.&#160;  They seemed to have long been waiting
for something; it had come, and they were waiting again!&#160;
 A shudder went through me on the winding stair:&#160;
the house had grown strange to me! something was about
to leap upon me from behind!&#160;  I darted down the
spiral, struck against the wall and fell, rose and
ran.&#160;  On the next floor I lost my way, and had
gone through several passages a second time ere I
found the head of the stair.&#160;  At the top of the
great stair I had come to myself a little, and in a
few moments I sat recovering my breath in the library.</p>

<p align="justify">Nothing should ever again make me
go up that last terrible stair!&#160; The garret at
the top of it pervaded the whole house!&#160;  It sat
upon it, threatening to crush me out of it!&#160; 
The brooding brain of the building, it was full of
mysterious dwellers, one or other of whom might any
moment appear in the library where I sat!&#160;  I was
nowhere safe!&#160;  I would let, I would sell the
dreadful place, in which an a&#235;rial portal stood ever
open to creatures whose life was other than human!&#160;
 I would purchase a crag in Switzerland, and thereon
build a wooden nest of one story with never a garret
above it, guarded by some grand old peak that would
send down nothing worse than a few tons of whelming
rock!</p>

<p align="justify">I knew all the time that my thinking
was foolish, and was even aware of a certain undertone
of contemptuous humour in it; but suddenly it was
checked, and I seemed again to hear the croak of the
raven.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If I know nothing of my own
garret,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;what is there to
secure me against my own brain?&#160;  Can I tell what
it is even now generating?&#8212;&#173;what thought
it may present me the next moment, the next month,
or a year away?&#160;  What is at the heart of my brain?&#160;
 What is behind my <i>think</i>?&#160;  Am I there at
all?&#8212;&#173;Who, what am I?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I could no more answer the question
now than when the raven put it to me in&#8212;&#173;at&#8212;&#173;&#8220;Where
in?&#8212;&#173;where at?&#8221; I said, and gave myself
up as knowing anything of myself or the universe.</p>

<p align="justify">I started to my feet, hurried across
the room to the masked door, where the mutilated volume,
sticking out from the flat of soulless, bodiless,
non-existent books, appeared to beckon me, went down
on my knees, and opened it as far as its position
would permit, but could see nothing.&#160;  I got up
again, lighted a taper, and peeping as into a pair
of reluctant jaws, perceived that the manuscript was
verse.&#160;  Further I could not carry discovery.&#160;
 Beginnings of lines were visible on the left-hand
page, and ends of lines on the other; but I could
not, of course, get at the beginning and end of a single
line, and was unable, in what I could read, to make
any guess at the sense.&#160;  The mere words, however,
woke in me feelings which to describe was, from their
strangeness, impossible.&#160;  Some dreams, some poems,
some musical phrases, some pictures, wake feelings
such as one never had before, new in colour and form&#8212;&#173;spiritual
sensations, as it were, hitherto unproved:&#160; here,
some of the phrases, some of the senseless half-lines,
some even of the individual words affected me in similar
fashion&#8212;&#173;as with the aroma of an idea, rousing
in me a great longing to know what the poem or poems
might, even yet in their mutilation, hold or suggest.</p>

<p align="justify">I copied out a few of the larger shreds
attainable, and tried hard to complete some of the
lines, but without the least success.&#160;  The only
thing I gained in the effort was so much weariness
that, when I went to bed, I fell asleep at once and
slept soundly.</p>

<p align="justify">In the morning all that horror of
the empty garret spaces had left me.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER IV</h1>

<p><i>Somewhere</i> <i>or</i> <i>nowhere</i>?</p>

<p align="justify">The sun was very bright, but I doubted
if the day would long be fine, and looked into the
milky sapphire I wore, to see whether the star in
it was clear.&#160;  It was even less defined than I
had expected.&#160; I rose from the breakfast-table,
and went to the window to glance at the stone again.&#160;
 There had been heavy rain in the night, and on the
lawn was a thrush breaking his way into the shell of
a snail.</p>

<p align="justify">As I was turning my ring about to
catch the response of the star to the sun, I spied
a keen black eye gazing at me out of the milky misty
blue.&#160;  The sight startled me so that I dropped
the ring, and when I picked it up the eye was gone
from it.&#160;  The same moment the sun was obscured;
a dark vapour covered him, and in a minute or two
the whole sky was clouded.&#160;  The air had grown
sultry, and a gust of wind came suddenly.&#160;  A
moment more and there was a flash of lightning, with
a single sharp thunder-clap.&#160;  Then the rain fell
in torrents.</p>

<p align="justify">I had opened the window, and stood
there looking out at the precipitous rain, when I
descried a raven walking toward me over the grass,
with solemn gait, and utter disregard of the falling
deluge.&#160;  Suspecting who he was, I congratulated
myself that I was safe on the ground-floor.&#160; 
At the same time I had a conviction that, if I were
not careful, something would happen.</p>

<p align="justify">He came nearer and nearer, made a
profound bow, and with a sudden winged leap stood
on the window-sill.&#160;  Then he stepped over the
ledge, jumped down into the room, and walked to the
door.&#160;  I thought he was on his way to the library,
and followed him, determined, if he went up the stair,
not to take one step after him.&#160;  He turned, however,
neither toward the library nor the stair, but to a
little door that gave upon a grass-patch in a nook
between two portions of the rambling old house.&#160;
 I made haste to open it for him.&#160;  He stepped
out into its creeper-covered porch, and stood looking
at the rain, which fell like a huge thin cataract;
I stood in the door behind him.&#160;  The second flash
came, and was followed by a lengthened roll of more
distant thunder.&#160;  He turned his head over his
shoulder and looked at me, as much as to say, &#8220;You
hear that?&#8221; then swivelled it round again, and
anew contemplated the weather, apparently with approbation.&#160;
 So human were his pose and carriage and the way he
kept turning his head, that I remarked almost involuntarily,</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine weather for the worms, Mr. Raven!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, in
the rather croaky voice I had learned to know, &#8220;the
ground will be nice for them to get out and in!&#8212;&#173;It
must be a grand time on the steppes of Uranus!&#8221;
he added, with a glance upward; &#8220;I believe it
is raining there too; it was, all the last week!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should that make it a grand time?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because the animals there are
all burrowers,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;&#8212;&#173;like
the field-mice and the moles here.&#8212;&#173;They
will be, for ages to come.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How do you know that, if I
may be so bold?&#8221; I rejoined.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;As any one would who had been
there to see,&#8221; he replied.&#160;  &#8220;It is
a great sight, until you get used to it, when the
earth gives a heave, and out comes a beast.&#160; 
You might think it a hairy elephant or a deinotherium&#8212;&#173;but
none of the animals are the same as we have ever had
here.&#160;  I was almost frightened myself the first
time I saw the dry-bog-serpent come wallowing out&#8212;&#173;such
a head and mane! and <i>such</i> eyes!&#8212;&#173;but
the shower is nearly over.&#160;  It will stop directly
after the next thunder-clap.&#160;  There it is!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A flash came with the words, and in
about half a minute the thunder.&#160; Then the rain
ceased.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Now we should be going!&#8221;
said the raven, and stepped to the front of the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going where?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Going where we have to go,&#8221;
he answered.&#160;  &#8220;You did not surely think
you had got home?&#160;  I told you there was no going
out and in at pleasure until you were at home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not want to go,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That does not make any difference&#8212;&#173;at
least not much,&#8221; he answered.&#160; &#8220;This
is the way!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite content where I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so, but you are not.&#160;  Come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hopped from the porch onto the grass, and turned,
waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not leave the house to-day,&#8221; I
said with obstinacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come into the garden!&#8221; rejoined
the raven.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give in so far,&#8221; I replied, and stepped
from the porch.</p>

<p align="justify">The sun broke through the clouds,
and the raindrops flashed and sparkled on the grass.&#160;
 The raven was walking over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will wet your feet!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And mire my beak,&#8221; he
answered, immediately plunging it deep in the sod,
and drawing out a great wriggling red worm.&#160;  He
threw back his head, and tossed it in the air.&#160;
 It spread great wings, gorgeous in red and black,
and soared aloft.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tut! tut!&#8221; I exclaimed;
&#8220;you mistake, Mr. Raven:&#160; worms are not the
larv&#230; of butterflies!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he croaked;
&#8220;it will do for once!&#160;  I&#8217;m not a reading
man at present, but sexton at the&#8212;&#173;at a certain
graveyard&#8212;&#173;cemetery, more properly&#8212;&#173;in&#8212;&#173;at&#8212;&#173;no
matter where!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I see! you can&#8217;t keep
your spade still:&#160; and when you have nothing to
bury, you must dig something up!&#160;  Only you should
mind what it is before you make it fly!&#160;  No creature
should be allowed to forget what and where it came
from!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said the raven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it will grow proud, and cease to recognise
its superiors.&#8221;</p>

<p>No man knows it when he is making an idiot of himself.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Where <i>do</i> the worms come
from?&#8221; said the raven, as if suddenly grown
curious to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, from the earth, as you have just seen!&#8221;
I answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, last!&#8221; he replied.&#160;
 &#8220;But they can&#8217;t have come from it first&#8212;&#173;
for that will never go back to it!&#8221; he added,
looking up.</p>

<p align="justify">I looked up also, but could see nothing
save a little dark cloud, the edges of which were
red, as if with the light of the sunset.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Surely the sun is not going
down!&#8221; I exclaimed, struck with amazement.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; returned the
raven.&#160;  &#8220;That red belongs to the worm.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You see what comes of making
creatures forget their origin!&#8221; I cried with
some warmth.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is well, surely, if it be
to rise higher and grow larger!&#8221; he returned.&#160;
 &#8220;But indeed I only teach them to find it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have the air full of worms?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is the business of a sexton.&#160;
 If only the rest of the clergy understood it as well!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">In went his beak again through the
soft turf, and out came the wriggling worm.&#160; 
He tossed it in the air, and away it flew.</p>

<p align="justify">I looked behind me, and gave a cry
of dismay:&#160; I had but that moment declared I would
not leave the house, and already I was a stranger
in the strange land!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What right have you to treat
me so, Mr. Raven?&#8221; I said with deep offence.&#160;
 &#8220;Am I, or am I not, a free agent?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A man is as free as he chooses
to make himself, never an atom freer,&#8221; answered
the raven.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have no right to make me
do things against my will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you have a will, you will find that no
one can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrong me in the very essence of my individuality!&#8221;
I persisted.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If you were an individual I
could not, therefore now I do not.&#160;  You are but
beginning to become an individual.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">All about me was a pine-forest, in
which my eyes were already searching deep, in the
hope of discovering an unaccountable glimmer, and
so finding my way home.&#160;  But, alas! how could
I any longer call that house <i>home</i>, where every
door, every window opened into <i>out</i>, and even
the garden I could not keep inside!</p>

<p>I suppose I looked discomfited.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Perhaps it may comfort you,&#8221;
said the raven, &#8220;to be told that you have not
yet left your house, neither has your house left you.&#160;
 At the same time it cannot contain you, or you inhabit
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand you,&#8221; I replied.&#160;
 &#8220;Where am I?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In the region of the seven
dimensions,&#8221; he answered, with a curious noise
in his throat, and a flutter of his tail.&#160;  &#8220;You
had better follow me carefully now for a moment, lest
you should hurt some one!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is nobody to hurt but
yourself, Mr. Raven!&#160;  I confess I should rather
like to hurt you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That you see nobody is where
the danger lies.&#160;  But you see that large tree
to your left, about thirty yards away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do:&#160; why should I not?&#8221;
I answered testily.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ten minutes ago you did not
see it, and now you do not know where it stands!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you think it stands?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why <i>there</i>, where you know it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is <i>there</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You bother me with your silly
questions!&#8221; I cried.&#160;  &#8220;I am growing
tired of you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That tree stands on the hearth
of your kitchen, and grows nearly straight up its
chimney,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Now I <i>know</i> you are making
game of me!&#8221; I answered, with a laugh of scorn.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Was I making game of you when
you discovered me looking out of your star-sapphire
yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was this morning&#8212;&#173;not an hour
ago!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have been widening your horizon
longer than that, Mr. Vane; but never mind!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You mean you have been making
a fool of me!&#8221; I said, turning from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me:&#160; no one can do that but yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I decline to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In declining to acknowledge
yourself one already.&#160;  You make yourself such
by refusing what is true, and for that you will sorely
punish yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How, again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By believing what is not true.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then, if I walk to the other
side of that tree, I shall walk through the kitchen
fire?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Certainly.&#160;  You would
first, however, walk through the lady at the piano
in the breakfast-room.&#160;  That rosebush is close
by her.&#160;  You would give her a terrible start!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no lady in the house!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Indeed!&#160; Is not your housekeeper
a lady?&#160;  She is counted such in a certain country
where all are servants, and the liveries one and multitudinous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She cannot use the piano, anyhow!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Her niece can:&#160; she is
there&#8212;&#173;a well-educated girl and a capital
musician.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Excuse me; I cannot help it:&#160;
you seem to me to be talking sheer nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If you could but hear the music!&#160;
 Those great long heads of wild hyacinth are inside
the piano, among the strings of it, and give that
peculiar sweetness to her playing!&#8212;&#173;Pardon
me:&#160; I forgot your deafness!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Two objects,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;cannot exist in the same place at the same
time!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Can they not?&#160;  I did not
know!&#8212;&#173;I remember now they do teach that
with you.&#160;  It is a great mistake&#8212;&#173;one
of the greatest ever wiseacre made!&#160;  No man of
the universe, only a man of the world could have said
so!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You a librarian, and talk such
rubbish!&#8221; I cried.&#160;  &#8220;Plainly, you
did not read many of the books in your charge!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, yes!&#160;  I went through
all in your library&#8212;&#173;at the time, and came
out at the other side not much the wiser.&#160;  I was
a bookworm then, but when I came to know it, I woke
among the butterflies.&#160;  To be sure I have given
up reading for a good many years&#8212;&#173;ever since
I was made sexton.&#8212;&#173;There!&#160;  I smell
Grieg&#8217;s Wedding March in the quiver of those
rose-petals!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I went to the rose-bush and listened
hard, but could not hear the thinnest ghost of a sound;
I only smelt something I had never before smelt in
any rose.&#160;  It was still rose-odour, but with a
difference, caused, I suppose, by the Wedding March.</p>

<p>When I looked up, there was the bird by my side.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mr. Raven,&#8221; I said, &#8220;forgive
me for being so rude:&#160; I was irritated.&#160; Will
you kindly show me my way home?&#160;  I must go, for
I have an appointment with my bailiff.&#160;  One must
not break faith with his servants!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You cannot break what was broken
days ago!&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do show me the way,&#8221; I pleaded.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; he returned.&#160;
 &#8220;To go back, you must go through yourself,
and that way no man can show another.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Entreaty was vain.&#160;  I must accept
my fate!&#160;  But how was life to be lived in a world
of which I had all the laws to learn?&#160;  There would,
however, be adventure! that held consolation; and whether
I found my way home or not, I should at least have
the rare advantage of knowing two worlds!</p>

<p align="justify">I had never yet done anything to justify
my existence; my former world was nothing the better
for my sojourn in it:&#160; here, however, I must earn,
or in some way find, my bread!&#160;  But I reasoned
that, as I was not to blame in being here, I might
expect to be taken care of here as well as there!&#160;
 I had had nothing to do with getting into the world
I had just left, and in it I had found myself heir
to a large property!&#160;  If that world, as I now
saw, had a claim upon me because I had eaten, and
could eat again, upon this world I had a claim because
I must eat&#8212;&#173;when it would in return have
a claim on me!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is no hurry,&#8221; said
the raven, who stood regarding me; &#8220;we do not
go much by the clock here.&#160;  Still, the sooner
one begins to do what has to be done, the better!&#160;
 I will take you to my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Thank you.&#160;  Let us go!&#8221;
I answered, and immediately he led the way.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER V</h1>

<p><b>THE OLD CHURCH</b></p>

<p align="justify">I followed him deep into the pine-forest.&#160;
 Neither of us said much while yet the sacred gloom
of it closed us round.&#160;  We came to larger and
yet larger trees&#8212;&#173;older, and more individual,
some of them grotesque with age.&#160;  Then the forest
grew thinner.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You see that hawthorn?&#8221;
said my guide at length, pointing with his beak.</p>

<p align="justify">I looked where the wood melted away
on the edge of an open heath.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I see a gnarled old man, with
a great white head,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look again,&#8221; he rejoined:&#160; &#8220;it
is a hawthorn.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It seems indeed an ancient
hawthorn; but this is not the season for the hawthorn
to blossom!&#8221; I objected.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The season for the hawthorn
to blossom,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;is when the
hawthorn blossoms.&#160;  That tree is in the ruins
of the church on your home-farm.&#160;  You were going
to give some directions to the bailiff about its churchyard,
were you not, the morning of the thunder?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was going to tell him I wanted
it turned into a wilderness of rose-trees, and that
the plough must never come within three yards of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; said the raven, seeming to hold
his breath.</p>

<p align="justify">I listened, and heard&#8212;&#173;was
it the sighing of a far-off musical wind&#8212;&#173;or
the ghost of a music that had once been glad?&#160;
 Or did I indeed hear anything?</p>

<p>&#8220;They go there still,&#8221; said the raven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there? and where do they go?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Some of the people who used
to pray there, go to the ruins still,&#8221; he replied.&#160;
 &#8220;But they will not go much longer, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes them go now?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They need help from each other
to get their thinking done, and their feelings hatched,
so they talk and sing together; and then, they say,
the big thought floats out of their hearts like a great
ship out of the river at high water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they pray as well as sing?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No; they have found that each
can best pray in his own silent heart.&#8212;&#173;Some
people are always at their prayers.&#8212;&#173;Look!
look!&#160; There goes one!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He pointed right up into the air.&#160;
 A snow-white pigeon was mounting, with quick and
yet quicker wing-flap, the unseen spiral of an ethereal
stair.&#160;  The sunshine flashed quivering from its
wings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see a pigeon!&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Of course you see a pigeon,&#8221;
rejoined the raven, &#8220;for there is the pigeon!&#160;
 I see a prayer on its way.&#8212;&#173;I wonder now
what heart is that dove&#8217;s mother!&#160;  Some
one may have come awake in my cemetery!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How can a pigeon be a prayer?&#8221;
I said.&#160;  &#8220;I understand, of course, how
it should be a fit symbol or likeness for one; but
a live pigeon to come out of a heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>must</i> puzzle you!&#160;  It cannot fail
to do so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A prayer is a thought, a thing spiritual!&#8221;
I pursued.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Very true!&#160; But if you
understood any world besides your own, you would understand
your own much better.&#8212;&#173;When a heart is really
alive, then it is able to think live things.&#160; 
There is one heart all whose thoughts are strong,
happy creatures, and whose very dreams are lives.&#160;
 When some pray, they lift heavy thoughts from the
ground, only to drop them on it again; others send
up their prayers in living shapes, this or that, the
nearest likeness to each.&#160;  All live things were
thoughts to begin with, and are fit therefore to be
used by those that think.&#160;  When one says to the
great Thinker:&#8212;&#173; &#8220;Here is one of thy
thoughts:&#160; I am thinking it now!&#8221; that is
a prayer&#8212;&#173;a word to the big heart from one
of its own little hearts.&#8212;&#173; Look, there
is another!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">This time the raven pointed his beak
downward&#8212;&#173;to something at the foot of a
block of granite.&#160;  I looked, and saw a little
flower.&#160;  I had never seen one like it before,
and cannot utter the feeling it woke in me by its
gracious, trusting form, its colour, and its odour
as of a new world that was yet the old.&#160;  I can
only say that it suggested an anemone, was of a pale
rose-hue, and had a golden heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a prayer-flower,&#8221; said the raven.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw such a flower before!&#8221; I
rejoined.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is no other such.&#160;
 Not one prayer-flower is ever quite like another,&#8221;
he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it a prayer-flower?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By the expression of it,&#8221;
he answered.&#160;  &#8220;More than that I cannot
tell you.&#160;  If you know it, you know it; if you
do not, you do not.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Could you not teach me to know
a prayer-flower when I see it?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I could not.&#160;  But if I
could, what better would you be? you would not know
it of <i>yourself</i> and ITself!&#160;  Why know the
name of a thing when the thing itself you do not know?&#160;
 Whose work is it but your own to open your eyes?&#160;
 But indeed the business of the universe is to make
such a fool of you that you will know yourself for
one, and so begin to be wise!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But I did see that the flower was
different from any flower I had ever seen before;
therefore I knew that I must be seeing a shadow of
the prayer in it; and a great awe came over me to think
of the heart listening to the flower.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER VI</h1>

<p><b>THE SEXTON&#8217;S COTTAGE</b></p>

<p align="justify">We had been for some time walking
over a rocky moorland covered with dry plants and
mosses, when I descried a little cottage in the farthest
distance.&#160;  The sun was not yet down, but he was
wrapt in a gray cloud.&#160;  The heath looked as if
it had never been warm, and the wind blew strangely
cold, as if from some region where it was always night.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Here we are at last!&#8221;
said the raven.&#160;  &#8220;What a long way it is!&#160;
 In half the time I could have gone to Paradise and
seen my cousin&#8212;&#173;him, you remember, who never
came back to Noah!&#160;  Dear! dear! it is almost
winter!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Winter!&#8221; I cried; &#8220;it
seems but half a day since we left home!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is because we have travelled
so fast,&#8221; answered the raven.&#160;  &#8220;In
your world you cannot pull up the plumb-line you call
gravitation, and let the world spin round under your
feet!&#160;  But here is my wife&#8217;s house!&#160;
 She is very good to let me live with her, and call
it the sexton&#8217;s cottage!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But where is your churchyard&#8212;&#173;your
cemetery&#8212;&#173;where you make your graves, I
mean?&#8221; said I, seeing nothing but the flat heath.</p>

<p align="justify">The raven stretched his neck, held
out his beak horizontally, turned it slowly round
to all the points of the compass, and said nothing.</p>

<p align="justify">I followed the beak with my eyes,
and lo, without church or graves, all was a churchyard!&#160;
 Wherever the dreary wind swept, there was the raven&#8217;s
cemetery!&#160;  He was sexton of all he surveyed! lord
of all that was laid aside!&#160;  I stood in the burial-ground
of the universe; its compass the unenclosed heath,
its wall the gray horizon, low and starless!&#160;
 I had left spring and summer, autumn and sunshine
behind me, and come to the winter that waited for me!&#160;
 I had set out in the prime of my youth, and here
I was already!&#8212;&#173;But I mistook.&#160; The
day might well be long in that region, for it contained
the seasons.&#160;  Winter slept there, the night through,
in his winding-sheet of ice; with childlike smile,
Spring came awake in the dawn; at noon, Summer blazed
abroad in her gorgeous beauty; with the slow-changing
afternoon, old Autumn crept in, and died at the first
breath of the vaporous, ghosty night.</p>

<p align="justify">As we drew near the cottage, the clouded
sun was rushing down the steepest slope of the west,
and he sank while we were yet a few yards from the
door.&#160;  The same instant I was assailed by a cold
that seemed almost a material presence, and I struggled
across the threshold as if from the clutches of an
icy death.&#160;  A wind swelled up on the moor, and
rushed at the door as with difficulty I closed it
behind me.&#160;  Then all was still, and I looked about
me.</p>

<p align="justify">A candle burned on a deal table in
the middle of the room, and the first thing I saw
was the lid of a coffin, as I thought, set up against
the wall; but it opened, for it was a door, and a woman
entered.&#160;  She was all in white&#8212;&#173;as white
as new-fallen snow; and her face was as white as her
dress, but not like snow, for at once it suggested
warmth.&#160;  I thought her features were perfect,
but her eyes made me forget them.&#160;  The life of
her face and her whole person was gathered and concentrated
in her eyes, where it became light.&#160; It might
have been coming death that made her face luminous,
but the eyes had life in them for a nation&#8212;&#173;large,
and dark with a darkness ever deepening as I gazed.&#160;
 A whole night-heaven lay condensed in each pupil;
all the stars were in its blackness, and flashed; while
round it for a horizon lay coiled an iris of the eternal
twilight.&#160; What any eye <i>is</i>, God only knows:&#160;
her eyes must have been coming direct out of his own!
the still face might be a primeval perfection; the
live eyes were a continuous creation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Mr. Vane, wife!&#8221; said the raven.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He is welcome,&#8221; she answered,
in a low, rich, gentle voice.&#160; Treasures of immortal
sound seemed to he buried in it.</p>

<p>I gazed, and could not speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would be glad to see him!&#8221;
added the raven.</p>

<p align="justify">She stood in front of the door by
which she had entered, and did not come nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he sleep?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear not,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;he is
neither weary nor heavy laden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why then have you brought him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my fears it may prove precipitate.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not quite understand you,&#8221;
I said, with an uneasy foreboding as to what she meant,
but a vague hope of some escape.&#160;  &#8220;Surely
a man must do a day&#8217;s work first!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I gazed into the white face of the
woman, and my heart fluttered.&#160; She returned my
gaze in silence.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Let me first go home,&#8221;
I resumed, &#8220;and come again after I have found
or made, invented, or at least discovered something!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He has not yet learned that
the day begins with sleep!&#8221; said the woman,
turning to her husband.&#160;  &#8220;Tell him he must
rest before he can do anything!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Men,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;think
so much of having done, that they fall asleep upon
it.&#160;  They cannot empty an egg but they turn into
the shell, and lie down!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words drew my eyes from the woman to the raven.</p>

<p align="justify">I saw no raven, but the librarian&#8212;&#173;the
same slender elderly man, in a rusty black coat, large
in the body and long in the tails.&#160;  I had seen
only his back before; now for the first time I saw
his face.&#160;  It was so thin that it showed the
shape of the bones under it, suggesting the skulls
his last-claimed profession must have made him familiar
with.&#160;  But in truth I had never before seen a
face so alive, or a look so keen or so friendly as
that in his pale blue eyes, which yet had a haze about
them as if they had done much weeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew I was not a raven!&#8221; he said
with a smile.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I knew you were Mr. Raven,&#8221;
I replied; &#8220;but somehow I thought you a bird
too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you think me a bird?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You looked a raven, and I saw
you dig worms out of the earth with your beak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Toss them in the air.&#8221;&#160;<br>
&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They grew butterflies, and flew away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see a raven do that?&#160;  I told
you I was a sexton!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does a sexton toss worms in the air, and turn
them into butterflies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw one do it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You saw me do it!&#8212;&#173;But
I am still librarian in your house, for I never was
dismissed, and never gave up the office.&#160;  Now
I am librarian here as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have just told me you were sexton here!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So I am.&#160;  It is much the
same profession.&#160;  Except you are a true sexton,
books are but dead bodies to you, and a library nothing
but a catacomb!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bewilder me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A few moments he stood silent.&#160;
 The woman, moveless as a statue, stood silent also
by the coffin-door.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Upon occasion,&#8221; said
the sexton at length, &#8220;it is more convenient
to put one&#8217;s bird-self in front.&#160;  Every
one, as you ought to know, has a beast-self&#8212;&#173;and
a bird-self, and a stupid fish-self, ay, and a creeping
serpent-self too&#8212;&#173;which it takes a deal of
crushing to kill!&#160;  In truth he has also a tree-self
and a crystal-self, and I don&#8217;t know how many
selves more&#8212;&#173;all to get into harmony.&#160;
 You can tell what sort a man is by his creature that
comes oftenest to the front.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He turned to his wife, and I considered
him more closely.&#160;  He was above the ordinary
height, and stood more erect than when last I saw
him.&#160;  His face was, like his wife&#8217;s, very
pale; its nose handsomely encased the beak that had
retired within it; its lips were very thin, and even
they had no colour, but their curves were beautiful,
and about them quivered a shadowy smile that had humour
in it as well as love and pity.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We are in want of something
to eat and drink, wife,&#8221; he said; &#8220;we
have come a long way!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You know, husband,&#8221; she
answered, &#8220;we can give only to him that asks.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She turned her unchanging face and
radiant eyes upon mine.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Please give me something to
eat, Mrs. Raven,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and something&#8212;&#173;what
you will&#8212;&#173;to quench my thirst.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your thirst must be greater
before you can have what will quench it,&#8221; she
replied; &#8220;but what I can give you, I will gladly.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She went to a cupboard in the wall,
brought from it bread and wine, and set them on the
table.</p>

<p align="justify">We sat down to the perfect meal; and
as I ate, the bread and wine seemed to go deeper than
the hunger and thirst.&#160;  Anxiety and discomfort
vanished; expectation took their place.</p>

<p>I grew very sleepy, and now first felt weary.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have earned neither food
nor sleep, Mrs. Raven,&#8221; I said, &#8220;but you
have given me the one freely, and now I hope you will
give me the other, for I sorely need it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Sleep is too fine a thing ever
to be earned,&#8221; said the sexton; &#8220;it must
be given and accepted, for it is a necessity.&#160;
 But it would be perilous to use this house as a half-way
hostelry&#8212;&#173;for the repose of a night, that
is, merely.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A wild-looking little black cat jumped
on his knee as he spoke.&#160; He patted it as one
pats a child to make it go to sleep:&#160; he seemed
to me patting down the sod upon a grave&#8212;&#173;patting
it lovingly, with an inward lullaby.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Here is one of Mara&#8217;s
kittens!&#8221; he said to his wife:&#160; &#8220;will
you give it something and put it out? she may want
it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The woman took it from him gently,
gave it a little piece of bread, and went out with
it, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How then am I to make use of
your hospitality?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;By accepting it to the full,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this house no one wakes of himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because no one anywhere ever
wakes of himself.&#160;  You can wake yourself no more
than you can make yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then perhaps you or Mrs. Raven
would kindly call me!&#8221; I said, still nowise
understanding, but feeling afresh that vague foreboding.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare I then go to sleep?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If you would have the rest
of this house, you must not trouble yourself about
waking.&#160;  You must go to sleep heartily, altogether
and outright.&#8221;&#160; My soul sank within me.</p>

<p align="justify">The sexton sat looking me in the face.&#160;
 His eyes seemed to say, &#8220;Will you not trust
me?&#8221; I returned his gaze, and answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I will show
you your couch.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As we rose, the woman came in.&#160;
 She took up the candle, turned to the inner door,
and led the way.&#160;  I went close behind her, and
the sexton followed.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER VII</h1>

<p><b>THE  CEMETERY</b></p>

<p align="justify">The air as of an ice-house met me
crossing the threshold.&#160;  The door fell-to behind
us.&#160;  The sexton said something to his wife that
made her turn toward us.&#8212;&#173;What a change had
passed upon her!&#160; It was as if the splendour of
her eyes had grown too much for them to hold, and,
sinking into her countenance, made it flash with a
loveliness like that of Beatrice in the white rose
of the redeemed.&#160; Life itself, life eternal, immortal,
streamed from it, an unbroken lightning.&#160;  Even
her hands shone with a white radiance, every &#8220;pearl-shell
helmet&#8221; gleaming like a moonstone.&#160;  Her
beauty was overpowering; I was glad when she turned
it from me.</p>

<p align="justify">But the light of the candle reached
such a little way, that at first I could see nothing
of the place.&#160;  Presently, however, it fell on
something that glimmered, a little raised from the
floor.&#160;  Was it a bed?&#160;  Could live thing
sleep in such a mortal cold?&#160;  Then surely it
was no wonder it should not wake of itself!&#160;  Beyond
that appeared a fainter shine; and then I thought
I descried uncertain gleams on every side.</p>

<p align="justify">A few paces brought us to the first;
it was a human form under a sheet, straight and still&#8212;&#173;whether
of man or woman I could not tell, for the light seemed
to avoid the face as we passed.</p>

<p align="justify">I soon perceived that we were walking
along an aisle of couches, on almost every one of
which, with its head to the passage, lay something
asleep or dead, covered with a sheet white as snow.&#160;
 My soul grew silent with dread.&#160;  Through aisle
after aisle we went, among couches innumerable.&#160;
 I could see only a few of them at once, but they
were on all sides, vanishing, as it seemed, in the
infinite.&#8212;&#173;Was it here lay my choice of a
bed?&#160;  Must I go to sleep among the unwaking,
with no one to rouse me?&#160;  Was this the sexton&#8217;s
library? were these his books?&#160;  Truly it was no
half-way house, this chamber of the dead!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;One of the cellars I am placed
to watch!&#8221; remarked Mr. Raven&#8212;&#173;in
a low voice, as if fearing to disturb his silent guests.&#160;
 &#8220;Much wine is set here to ripen!&#8212;&#173;But
it is dark for a stranger!&#8221; he added.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The moon is rising; she will
soon be here,&#8221; said his wife, and her clear
voice, low and sweet, sounded of ancient sorrow long
bidden adieu.</p>

<p align="justify">Even as she spoke the moon looked
in at an opening in the wall, and a thousand gleams
of white responded to her shine.&#160;  But not yet
could I descry beginning or end of the couches.&#160;
 They stretched away and away, as if for all the disparted
world to sleep upon.&#160;  For along the far receding
narrow ways, every couch stood by itself, and on each
slept a lonely sleeper.&#160;  I thought at first their
sleep was death, but I soon saw it was something deeper
still&#8212;&#173;a something I did not know.</p>

<p align="justify">The moon rose higher, and shone through
other openings, but I could never see enough of the
place at once to know its shape or character; now
it would resemble a long cathedral nave, now a huge
barn made into a dwelling of tombs.&#160;  She looked
colder than any moon in the frostiest night of the
world, and where she shone direct upon them, cast
a bluish, icy gleam on the white sheets and the pallid
countenances&#8212;&#173;but it might be the faces that
made the moon so cold!</p>

<p align="justify">Of such as I could see, all were alike
in the brotherhood of death, all unlike in the character
and history recorded upon them.&#160;  Here lay a man
who had died&#8212;&#173;for although this was not death,
I have no other name to give it&#8212;&#173;in the
prime of manly strength; his dark beard seemed to
flow like a liberated stream from the glacier of his
frozen countenance; his forehead was smooth as polished
marble; a shadow of pain lingered about his lips,
but only a shadow.&#160;  On the next couch lay the
form of a girl, passing lovely to behold.&#160; The
sadness left on her face by parting was not yet absorbed
in perfect peace, but absolute submission possessed
the placid features, which bore no sign of wasting
disease, of &#8220;killing care or grief of heart&#8221;:&#160;
if pain had been there, it was long charmed asleep,
never again to wake.&#160;  Many were the beautiful
that there lay very still&#8212;&#173; some of them
mere children; but I did not see one infant.&#160; 
The most beautiful of all was a lady whose white hair,
and that alone, suggested her old when first she fell
asleep.&#160;  On her stately countenance rested&#8212;&#173;not
submission, but a right noble acquiescence, an assurance,
firm as the foundations of the universe, that all was
as it should be.&#160;  On some faces lingered the almost
obliterated scars of strife, the marrings of hopeless
loss, the fading shadows of sorrows that had seemed
inconsolable:&#160; the aurora of the great morning
had not yet quite melted them away; but those faces
were few, and every one that bore such brand of pain
seemed to plead, &#8220;Pardon me:&#160; I died only
yesterday!&#8221; or, &#8220;Pardon me:&#160; I died
but a century ago!&#8221;  That some had been dead
for ages I knew, not merely by their unutterable repose,
but by something for which I have neither word nor
symbol.</p>

<p align="justify">We came at last to three empty couches,
immediately beyond which lay the form of a beautiful
woman, a little past the prime of life.&#160; One of
her arms was outside the sheet, and her hand lay with
the palm upward, in its centre a dark spot.&#160; 
Next to her was the stalwart figure of a man of middle
age.&#160;  His arm too was outside the sheet, the
strong hand almost closed, as if clenched on the grip
of a sword.&#160;  I thought he must be a king who had
died fighting for the truth.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Will you hold the candle nearer,
wife?&#8221; whispered the sexton, bending down to
examine the woman&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It heals well,&#8221; he murmured
to himself:&#160; &#8220;the nail found in her nothing
to hurt!&#8221;</p>

<p>At last I ventured to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they not dead?&#8221; I asked softly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot answer you,&#8221;
he replied in a subdued voice.&#160;  &#8220;I almost
forget what they mean by <i>dead</i> in the old world.&#160;
 If I said a person was dead, my wife would understand
one thing, and you would imagine another.&#8212;&#173;This
is but one of my treasure vaults,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;and all my guests are not laid in vaults:&#160;
out there on the moor they lie thick as the leaves
of a forest after the first blast of your winter&#8212;&#173;thick,
let me say rather, as if the great white rose of heaven
had shed its petals over it.&#160;  All night the moon
reads their faces, and smiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why leave them in the corrupting moonlight?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Our moon,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;is not like yours&#8212;&#173;the old cinder
of a burnt-out world; her beams embalm the dead, not
corrupt them.&#160;  You observe that here the sexton
lays his dead on the earth; be buries very few under
it!&#160;  In your world he lays huge stones on them,
as if to keep them down; I watch for the hour to ring
the resurrection-bell, and wake those that are still
asleep.&#160;  Your sexton looks at the clock to know
when to ring the dead-alive to church; I hearken for
the cock on the spire to crow; `<i>awake</i>, <i>thou</i>
<i>that</i> SLEEPEST, <i>and</i> <i>arise</i> <i>from</i> <i>the</i>
<i>dead</i>!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I began to conclude that the self-styled
sexton was in truth an insane parson:&#160; the whole
thing was too mad!&#160;  But how was I to get away
from it?&#160;  I was helpless!&#160;  In this world
of the dead, the raven and his wife were the only
living I had yet seen:&#160; whither should I turn
for help?&#160;  I was lost in a space larger than
imagination; for if here two things, or any parts of
them, could occupy the same space, why not twenty
or ten thousand?&#8212;&#173;But I dared not think
further in that direction.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You seem in your dead to see
differences beyond my perception!&#8221; I ventured
to remark.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;None of those you see,&#8221;
he answered, &#8220;are in truth quite dead yet, and
some have but just begun to come alive and die.&#160;
 Others had begun to die, that is to come alive, long
before they came to us; and when such are indeed dead,
that instant they will wake and leave us.&#160;  Almost
every night some rise and go.&#160;  But I will not
say more, for I find my words only mislead you!&#8212;&#173;This
is the couch that has been waiting for you,&#8221;
he ended, pointing to one of the three.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why just this?&#8221; I said,
beginning to tremble, and anxious by parley to delay.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;For reasons which one day you
will be glad to know,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not know them now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That also you will know when you wake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But these are all dead, and I am alive!&#8221;
I objected, shuddering.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not much,&#8221; rejoined the
sexton with a smile, &#8220;&#8212;&#173;not nearly
enough!&#160; Blessed be the true life that the pauses
between its throbs are not death!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The place is too cold to let one sleep!&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Do these find it so?&#8221;
he returned.&#160;  &#8220;They sleep well&#8212;&#173;or
will soon.&#160; Of cold they feel not a breath:&#160;
it heals their wounds.&#8212;&#173;Do not be a coward,
Mr. Vane.&#160;  Turn your back on fear, and your face
to whatever may come.&#160;  Give yourself up to the
night, and you will rest indeed.&#160; Harm will not
come to you, but a good you cannot foreknow.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The sexton and I stood by the side
of the couch, his wife, with the candle in her hand,
at the foot of it.&#160;  Her eyes were full of light,
but her face was again of a still whiteness; it was
no longer radiant.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Would they have me make of
a charnel-house my bed-chamber?&#8221; I cried aloud.&#160;
 &#8220;I will not.&#160;  I will lie abroad on the
heath; it cannot be colder there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just told you that the dead are there
also,</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;`Thick as autumnal leaves
that strow the brooks<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Vallombrosa,&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>said the librarian.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will <i>not</i>,&#8221; I cried
again; and in the compassing dark, the two gleamed
out like spectres that waited on the dead; neither
answered me; each stood still and sad, and looked
at the other.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Be of good comfort; we watch
the flock of the great shepherd,&#8221; said the sexton
to his wife.</p>

<p>Then he turned to me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Didst thou not find the air
of the place pure and sweet when thou enteredst it?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but oh, so cold!&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then know,&#8221; he returned,
and his voice was stern, &#8220;that thou who callest
thyself alive, hast brought into this chamber the odours
of death, and its air will not be wholesome for the
sleepers until thou art gone from it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">They went farther into the great chamber,
and I was left alone in the moonlight with the dead.</p>

<p>I turned to escape.</p>

<p align="justify">What a long way I found it back through
the dead!&#160;  At first I was too angry to be afraid,
but as I grew calm, the still shapes grew terrible.&#160;
 At last, with loud offence to the gracious silence,
I ran, I fled wildly, and, bursting out, flung-to
the door behind me.&#160; It closed with an awful silence.</p>

<p align="justify">I stood in pitch-darkness.&#160;  Feeling
about me, I found a door, opened it, and was aware
of the dim light of a lamp.&#160;  I stood in my library,
with the handle of the masked door in my hand.</p>

<p align="justify">Had I come to myself out of a vision?&#8212;&#173;or
lost myself by going back to one?&#160;  Which was
the real&#8212;&#173;what I now saw, or what I had just
ceased to see?&#160;  Could both be real, interpenetrating
yet unmingling?</p>

<p>I threw myself on a couch, and fell asleep.</p>

<p align="justify">In the library was one small window
to the east, through which, at this time of the year,
the first rays of the sun shone upon a mirror whence
they were reflected on the masked door:&#160; when I
woke, there they shone, and thither they drew my eyes.&#160;
 With the feeling that behind it must lie the boundless
chamber I had left by that door, I sprang to my feet,
and opened it.&#160;  The light, like an eager hound,
shot before me into the closet, and pounced upon the
gilded edges of a large book.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What idiot,&#8221; I cried,
&#8220;has put that book in the shelf the wrong way?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But the gilded edges, reflecting the
light a second time, flung it on a nest of drawers
in a dark corner, and I saw that one of them was half
open.</p>

<p>&#8220;More meddling!&#8221; I cried, and went to
close the drawer.</p>

<p align="justify">It contained old papers, and seemed
more than full, for it would not close.&#160;  Taking
the topmost one out, I perceived that it was in my
father&#8217;s writing and of some length.&#160;  The
words on which first my eyes fell, at once made me
eager to learn what it contained.&#160;  I carried
it to the library, sat down in one of the western windows,
and read what follows.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1>

<p><b>MY FATHER&#8217;S MANUSCRIPT</b></p>

<p align="justify">I am filled with awe of what I have
to write.&#160;  The sun is shining golden above me;
the sea lies blue beneath his gaze; the same world
sends its growing things up to the sun, and its flying
things into the air which I have breathed from my
infancy; but I know the outspread splendour a passing
show, and that at any moment it may, like the drop-scene
of a stage, be lifted to reveal more wonderful things.</p>

<p align="justify">Shortly after my father&#8217;s death,
I was seated one morning in the library.&#160;  I had
been, somewhat listlessly, regarding the portrait
that hangs among the books, which I knew only as that
of a distant ancestor, and wishing I could learn something
of its original.&#160;  Then I had taken a book from
the shelves and begun to read.</p>

<p align="justify">Glancing up from it, I saw coming
toward me&#8212;&#173;not between me and the door,
but between me and the portrait&#8212;&#173;a thin pale
man in rusty black.&#160;  He looked sharp and eager,
and had a notable nose, at once reminding me of a
certain jug my sisters used to call Mr. Crow.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Finding myself in your vicinity,
Mr. Vane, I have given myself the pleasure of calling,&#8221;
he said, in a peculiar but not disagreeable voice.&#160;
 &#8220;Your honoured grandfather treated me&#8212;&#173;I
may say it without presumption&#8212;&#173;as a friend,
having known me from childhood as his father&#8217;s
librarian.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It did not strike me at the time how
old the man must be.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask where you live now, Mr. Crow?&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>He smiled an amused smile.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You nearly hit my name,&#8221;
he rejoined, &#8220;which shows the family insight.&#160;
 You have seen me before, but only once, and could
not then have heard it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this very room.&#160;  You were quite a child,
however!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I could not be sure that I remembered
him, but for a moment I fancied I did, and I begged
him to set me right as to his name.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is such a thing as remembering
without recognising the memory in it,&#8221; he remarked.&#160;
 &#8220;For my name&#8212;&#173;which you have near
enough&#8212;&#173;it used to be Raven.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had heard the name, for marvellous
tales had brought it me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is very kind of you to come
and see me,&#8221; I said.&#160;  &#8220;Will you not
sit down?&#8221;</p>

<p>He seated himself at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew my father, then, I presume?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I knew him,&#8221; he answered
with a curious smile, &#8220;but he did not care about
my acquaintance, and we never met.&#8212;&#173;That
gentleman, however,&#8221; he added, pointing to the
portrait,&#8212;&#173;&#8220;old Sir Up&#8217;ard,
his people called him,&#8212;&#173;was in his day a
friend of mine yet more intimate than ever your grandfather
became.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Then at length I began to think the
interview a strange one.&#160;  But in truth it was
hardly stranger that my visitor should remember Sir
Upward, than that he should have been my great-grandfather&#8217;s
librarian!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I owe him much,&#8221; he continued;
&#8220;for, although I had read many more books than
he, yet, through the special direction of his studies,
he was able to inform me of a certain relation of
modes which I should never have discovered of myself,
and could hardly have learned from any one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling me all about that?&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By no means&#8212;&#173;as much
at least as I am able:&#160; there are not such things
as wilful secrets,&#8221; he answered&#8212;&#173;and
went on.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That closet held his library&#8212;&#173;a
hundred manuscripts or so, for printing was not then
invented.&#160;  One morning I sat there, working at
a catalogue of them, when he looked in at the door,
and said, `Come.&#8217;&#160;  I laid down my pen and
followed him&#8212;&#173;across the great hall, down
a steep rough descent, and along an underground passage
to a tower he had lately built, consisting of a stair
and a room at the top of it.&#160;  The door of this
room had a tremendous lock, which he undid with the
smallest key I ever saw.&#160;  I had scarcely crossed
the threshold after him, when, to my eyes, he began
to dwindle, and grew less and less.&#160;  All at once
my vision seemed to come right, and I saw that he
was moving swiftly away from me.&#160;  In a minute
more he was the merest speck in the distance, with
the tops of blue mountains beyond him, clear against
a sky of paler blue.&#160;  I recognised the country,
for I had gone there and come again many a time, although
I had never known this way to it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Many years after, when the
tower had long disappeared, I taught one of his descendants
what Sir Upward had taught me; and now and then to
this day I use your house when I want to go the nearest
way home.&#160;  I must indeed&#8212;&#173;without your
leave, for which I ask your pardon&#8212;&#173;have
by this time well established a right of way through
it&#8212;&#173;not from front to back, but from bottom
to top!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You would have me then understand,
Mr. Raven,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that you go through
my house into another world, heedless of disparting
space?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That I go through it is an
incontrovertible acknowledgement of space,&#8221;
returned the old librarian.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Please do not quibble, Mr.
Raven,&#8221; I rejoined.&#160;  &#8220;Please to take
my question as you know I mean it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is in your house a door,
one step through which carries me into a world very
much another than this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A better?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not throughout; but so much
another that most of its physical, and many of its
mental laws are different from those of this world.&#160;
 As for moral laws, they must everywhere be fundamentally
the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You try my power of belief!&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take me for a madman, probably?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not look like one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A liar then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You give me no ground to think you such.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only you do not believe me?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will go out of that door
with you if you like:&#160; I believe in you enough
to risk the attempt.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The blunder all my children
make!&#8221; he murmured.&#160;  &#8220;The only door
out is the door in!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I began to think he must be crazy.&#160;
 He sat silent for a moment, his head resting on his
hand, his elbow on the table, and his eyes on the
books before him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A book,&#8221; he said louder,
&#8220;is a door in, and therefore a door out.&#8212;&#173;I
see old Sir Up&#8217;ard,&#8221; he went on, closing
his eyes, &#8220;and my heart swells with love to
him:&#8212;&#173;what world is he in?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The world of your heart!&#8221;
I replied; &#8220;&#8212;&#173;that is, the idea of
him is there.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is one world then at
least on which your hall-door does not open?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I grant you so much; but the
things in that world are not things to have and to
hold.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Think a little farther,&#8221;
he rejoined:&#160; &#8220;did anything ever become
yours, except by getting into that world?&#8212;&#173;The
thought is beyond you, however, at present!&#8212;&#173;I
tell you there are more worlds, and more doors to
them, than you will think of in many years!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He rose, left the library, crossed
the hall, and went straight up to the garret, familiar
evidently with every turn.&#160;  I followed, studying
his back.&#160;  His hair hung down long and dark, straight
and glossy.&#160;  His coat was wide and reached to
his heels.&#160;  His shoes seemed too large for him.</p>

<p align="justify">In the garret a light came through
at the edges of the great roofing slabs, and showed
us parts where was no flooring, and we must step from
joist to joist:&#160; in the middle of one of these
spaces rose a partition, with a door:&#160; through
it I followed Mr. Raven into a small, obscure chamber,
whose top contracted as it rose, and went slanting
through the roof.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is the door I spoke of,&#8221;
he said, pointing to an oblong mirror that stood on
the floor and leaned against the wall.&#160;  I went
in front of it, and saw our figures dimly reflected
in its dusty face.&#160; There was something about
it that made me uneasy.&#160;  It looked old-fashioned
and neglected, but, notwithstanding its ordinary seeming,
the eagle, perched with outstretched wings on the top,
appeared threatful.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;As a mirror,&#8221; said the
librarian, &#8220;it has grown dingy with age; but
that is no matter:&#160; its doorness depends on the
light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Light!&#8221; I rejoined; &#8220;there is no
light here!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He did not answer me, but began to
pull at a little chain on the opposite wall.&#160;
 I heard a creaking:&#160; the top of the chamber was
turning slowly round.&#160;  He ceased pulling, looked
at his watch, and began to pull again.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We arrive almost to the moment!&#8221;
he said; &#8220;it is on the very stroke of noon!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The top went creaking and revolving
for a minute or so.&#160;  Then he pulled two other
chains, now this, now that, and returned to the first.&#160;
 A moment more and the chamber grew much clearer:&#160;
a patch of sunlight had fallen upon a mirror on the
wall opposite that against which the other leaned,
and on the dust I saw the path of the reflected rays
to the mirror on the ground.&#160;  But from the latter
none were returned; they seemed to go clean through;
there was nowhere in the chamber a second patch of
light!</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the sunrays gone?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That I cannot tell,&#8221;
returned Mr. Raven; &#8220;&#8212;&#173;back, perhaps,
to where they came from first.&#160;  They now belong,
I fancy, to a sense not yet developed in us.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He then talked of the relations of
mind to matter, and of senses to qualities, in a way
I could only a little understand, whence he went on
to yet stranger things which I could not at all comprehend.&#160;
He spoke much about dimensions, telling me that there
were many more than three, some of them concerned
with powers which were indeed in us, but of which
as yet we knew absolutely nothing.&#160;  His words,
however, I confess, took little more hold of me than
the light did of the mirror, for I thought he hardly
knew what he was saying.</p>

<p align="justify">Suddenly I was aware that our forms
had gone from the mirror, which seemed full of a white
mist.&#160;  As I gazed I saw, growing gradually visible
beyond the mist, the tops of a range of mountains,
which became clearer and clearer.&#160;  Soon the mist
vanished entirely, uncovering the face of a wide heath,
on which, at some distance, was the figure of a man
moving swiftly away.&#160;  I turned to address my
companion; he was no longer by my side.&#160;  I looked
again at the form in the mirror, and recognised the
wide coat flying, the black hair lifting in a wind
that did not touch me.&#160;  I rushed in terror from
the place.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER IX</h1>

<p><b>I REPENT</b></p>

<p align="justify">I laid the manuscript down, consoled
to find that my father had had a peep into that mysterious
world, and that he knew Mr. Raven.</p>

<p align="justify">Then I remembered that I had never
heard the cause or any circumstance of my father&#8217;s
death, and began to believe that he must at last have
followed Mr. Raven, and not come back; whereupon I
speedily grew ashamed of my flight.&#160;  What wondrous
facts might I not by this time have gathered concerning
life and death, and wide regions beyond ordinary perception!&#160;
 Assuredly the Ravens were good people, and a night
in their house would nowise have hurt me!&#160; They
were doubtless strange, but it was faculty in which
the one was peculiar, and beauty in which the other
was marvellous!&#160;  And I had not believed in them!
had treated them as unworthy of my confidence, as
harbouring a design against me!&#160;  The more I thought
of my behaviour to them, the more disgusted I became
with myself.&#160; Why should I have feared such dead?&#160;
 To share their holy rest was an honour of which I
had proved myself unworthy!&#160;  What harm could
that sleeping king, that lady with the wound in her
palm, have done me?&#160;  I fell a longing after the
sweet and stately stillness of their two countenances,
and wept.&#160;  Weeping I threw myself on a couch,
and suddenly fell asleep.</p>

<p align="justify">As suddenly I woke, feeling as if
some one had called me.&#160;  The house was still
as an empty church.&#160;  A blackbird was singing on
the lawn.&#160;  I said to myself, &#8220;I will go
and tell them I am ashamed, and will do whatever they
would have me do!&#8221; I rose, and went straight
up the stairs to the garret.</p>

<p align="justify">The wooden chamber was just as when
first I saw it, the mirror dimly reflecting everything
before it.&#160;  It was nearly noon, and the sun would
be a little higher than when first I came:&#160; I must
raise the hood a little, and adjust the mirrors accordingly!&#160;
 If I had but been in time to see Mr. Raven do it!</p>

<p align="justify">I pulled the chains, and let the light
fall on the first mirror.&#160; I turned then to the
other:&#160; there were the shapes of the former vision&#8212;&#173;distinguishable
indeed, but tremulous like a landscape in a pool ruffled
by &#8220;a small pipling wind!&#8221; I touched the
glass; it was impermeable.</p>

<p align="justify">Suspecting polarisation as the thing
required, I shifted and shifted the mirrors, changing
their relation, until at last, in a great degree,
so far as I was concerned, by chance, things came right
between them, and I saw the mountains blue and steady
and clear.&#160;  I stepped forward, and my feet were
among the heather.</p>

<p align="justify">All I knew of the way to the cottage
was that we had gone through a pine-forest.&#160; 
I passed through many thickets and several small fir-woods,
continually fancying afresh that I recognised something
of the country; but I had come upon no forest, and
now the sun was near the horizon, and the air had
begun to grow chill with the coming winter, when,
to my delight, I saw a little black object coming
toward me:&#160; it was indeed the raven!</p>

<p>I hastened to meet him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir, for
my rudeness last night,&#8221; I said.&#160;  &#8220;Will
you take me with you now?&#160;  I heartily confess
I do not deserve it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he returned, and
looked up.&#160;  Then, after a brief pause, &#8220;My
wife does not expect you to-night,&#8221; he said.&#160;
 &#8220;She regrets that we at all encouraged your
staying last week.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Take me to her that I may tell
her how sorry I am,&#8221; I begged humbly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is of no use,&#8221; he
answered.&#160;  &#8220;Your night was not come then,
or you would not have left us.&#160;  It is not come
now, and I cannot show you the way.&#160;  The dead
were rejoicing under their daisies&#8212;&#173;they
all lie among the roots of the flowers of heaven&#8212;&#173;at
the thought of your delight when the winter should
be past, and the morning with its birds come:&#160;
ere you left them, they shivered in their beds.&#160;
When the spring of the universe arrives,&#8212;&#173;but
that cannot be for ages yet! how many, I do not know&#8212;&#173;and
do not care to know.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tell me one thing, I beg of
you, Mr. Raven:&#160; is my father with you?&#160; 
Have you seen him since he left the world?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes; he is with us, fast asleep.&#160;
 That was he you saw with his arm on the coverlet,
his hand half closed.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why did you not tell me?&#160;
 That I should have been so near him, and not know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And turn your back on him!&#8221; corrected
the raven.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have lain down at once had I known!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I doubt it.&#160;  Had you been
ready to lie down, you would have known him!&#8212;&#173;Old
Sir Up&#8217;ard,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;and your
twice great-grandfather, both are up and away long
ago.&#160;  Your great-grandfather has been with us
for many a year; I think he will soon begin to stir.&#160;
 You saw him last night, though of course you did
not know him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why <i>of</i> <i>course</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because he is so much nearer
waking than you.&#160;  No one who will not sleep can
ever wake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not at all understand you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You turned away, and would not understand!&#8221;<br>
I held my peace.&#8212;&#173;But if I did not say something,
he would go!</p>

<p>&#8220;And my grandfather&#8212;&#173;is he also with
you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he is still in the Evil Wood, fighting
the dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the Evil Wood, that I may find him?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You will not find him; but
you will hardly miss the wood.&#160;  It is the place
where those who will not sleep, wake up at night, to
kill their dead and bury them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot understand you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Naturally not.&#160;  Neither
do I understand you; I can read neither your heart
nor your face.&#160;  When my wife and I do not understand
our children, it is because there is not enough of
them to be understood.&#160;  God alone can understand
foolishness.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then,&#8221; I said, feeling
naked and very worthless, &#8220;will you be so good
as show me the nearest way home?&#160;  There are more
ways than one, I know, for I have gone by two already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are indeed many ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, please, how to recognise the nearest.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; answered the
raven; &#8220;you and I use the same words with different
meanings.&#160;  We are often unable to tell people
what they <i>need</i> to know, because they <i>want</i>
to know something else, and would therefore only misunderstand
what we said.&#160;  Home is ever so far away in the
palm of your hand, and how to get there it is of no
use to tell you.&#160;  But you will get there; you
must get there; you have to get there.&#160;  Everybody
who is not at home, has to go home.&#160;  You thought
you were at home where I found you:&#160; if that had
been your home, you could not have left it.&#160; 
Nobody can leave home.&#160;  And nobody ever was or
ever will be at home without having gone there.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Enigma treading on enigma!&#8221;
I exclaimed.&#160;  &#8220;I did not come here to be
asked riddles.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No; but you came, and found
the riddles waiting for you!&#160;  Indeed you are
yourself the only riddle.&#160;  What you call riddles
are truths, and seem riddles because you are not true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse and worse!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And you <i>must</i> answer the
riddles!&#8221; he continued.&#160;  &#8220;They will
go on asking themselves until you understand yourself.&#160;
 The universe is a riddle trying to get out, and you
are holding your door hard against it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Will you not in pity tell me
what I am to do&#8212;&#173;where I must go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I tell <i>your</i> to-do, or the way
to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am not to go home, at least direct me
to some of my kind.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not know of any.&#160;
 The beings most like you are in that direction.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He pointed with his beak.&#160;  I
could see nothing but the setting sun, which blinded
me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said bitterly,
&#8220;I cannot help feeling hardly treated&#8212;&#173;taken
from my home, abandoned in a strange world, and refused
instruction as to where I am to go or what I am to
do!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You forget,&#8221; said the
raven, &#8220;that, when I brought you and you declined
my hospitality, you reached what you call home in safety:&#160;
now you are come of yourself!&#160;  Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He turned and walked slowly away,
with his beak toward the ground.&#160; I stood dazed.&#160;
 It was true I had come of myself, but had I not come
with intent of atonement?&#160;  My heart was sore,
and in my brain was neither quest nor purpose, hope
nor desire.&#160;  I gazed after the raven, and would
have followed him, but felt it useless.</p>

<p align="justify">All at once he pounced on a spot,
throwing the whole weight of his body on his bill,
and for some moments dug vigorously.&#160;  Then with
a flutter of his wings he threw back his head, and
something shot from his bill, cast high in the air.&#160;
 That moment the sun set, and the air at once grew
very dusk, but the something opened into a soft radiance,
and came pulsing toward me like a fire-fly, but with
a much larger and a yellower light.&#160;  It flew over
my head.&#160;  I turned and followed it.</p>

<p align="justify">Here I interrupt my narrative to remark
that it involves a constant struggle to say what cannot
be said with even an approach to precision, the things
recorded being, in their nature and in that of the
creatures concerned in them, so inexpressibly different
from any possible events of this economy, that I can
present them only by giving, in the forms and language
of life in this world, the modes in which they affected
me&#8212;&#173;not the things themselves, but the feelings
they woke in me.&#160;  Even this much, however, I do
with a continuous and abiding sense of failure, finding
it impossible to present more than one phase of a
multitudinously complicated significance, or one concentric
sphere of a graduated embodiment.&#160; A single thing
would sometimes seem to be and mean many things, with
an uncertain identity at the heart of them, which kept
constantly altering their look.&#160;  I am indeed
often driven to set down what I know to be but a clumsy
and doubtful representation of the mere feeling aimed
at, none of the communicating media of this world
being fit to convey it, in its peculiar strangeness,
with even an approach to clearness or certainty.&#160;
 Even to one who knew the region better than myself,
I should have no assurance of transmitting the reality
of my experience in it.&#160;  While without a doubt,
for instance, that I was actually regarding a scene
of activity, I might be, at the same moment, in my
consciousness aware that I was perusing a metaphysical
argument.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER X</h1>

<p><b>THE BAD BURROW</b></p>

<p align="justify">As the air grew black and the winter
closed swiftly around me, the fluttering fire blazed
out more luminous, and arresting its flight, hovered
waiting.&#160;  So soon as I came under its radiance,
it flew slowly on, lingering now and then above spots
where the ground was rocky.&#160;  Every time I looked
up, it seemed to have grown larger, and at length
gave me an attendant shadow.&#160;  Plainly a bird-butterfly,
it flew with a certain swallowy double.&#160;  Its wings
were very large, nearly square, and flashed all the
colours of the rainbow.&#160;  Wondering at their splendour,
I became so absorbed in their beauty that I stumbled
over a low rock, and lay stunned.&#160;  When I came
to myself, the creature was hovering over my head,
radiating the whole chord of light, with multitudinous
gradations and some kinds of colour I had never before
seen.&#160;  I rose and went on, but, unable to take
my eyes off the shining thing to look to my steps,
I struck my foot against a stone.&#160;  Fearing then
another fall, I sat down to watch the little glory,
and a great longing awoke in me to have it in my hand.&#160;
 To my unspeakable delight, it began to sink toward
me.&#160;  Slowly at first, then swiftly it sank, growing
larger as it came nearer.&#160; I felt as if the treasure
of the universe were giving itself to me&#8212;&#173;
put out my hand, and had it.&#160;  But the instant
I took it, its light went out; all was dark as pitch;
a dead book with boards outspread lay cold and heavy
in my hand.&#160;  I threw it in the air&#8212;&#173;only
to hear it fall among the heather.&#160;  Burying my
face in my hands, I sat in motionless misery.</p>

<p align="justify">But the cold grew so bitter that,
fearing to be frozen, I got up.&#160; The moment I
was on my feet, a faint sense of light awoke in me.&#160;
&#8220;Is it coming to life?&#8221; I cried, and a
great pang of hope shot through me.&#160;  Alas, no!
it was the edge of a moon peering up keen and sharp
over a level horizon!&#160;  She brought me light&#8212;&#173;but
no guidance!&#160;  <i>She</i> would not hover over me,
would not wait on my faltering steps!&#160;  She could
but offer me an ignorant choice!</p>

<p align="justify">With a full face she rose, and I began
to see a little about me.&#160; Westward of her, and
not far from me, a range of low hills broke the horizon-line:&#160;
I set out for it.</p>

<p align="justify">But what a night I had to pass ere
I reached it!&#160;  The moon seemed to know something,
for she stared at me oddly.&#160;  Her look was indeed
icy-cold, but full of interest, or at least curiosity.&#160;
 She was not the same moon I had known on the earth;
her face was strange to me, and her light yet stranger.&#160;
 Perhaps it came from an unknown sun!&#160; Every time
I looked up, I found her staring at me with all her
might!&#160; At first I was annoyed, as at the rudeness
of a fellow creature; but soon I saw or fancied a
certain wondering pity in her gaze:&#160; why was I
out in her night?&#160;  Then first I knew what an awful
thing it was to be awake in the universe:&#160; I <i>was</i>,
and could not help it!</p>

<p align="justify">As I walked, my feet lost the heather,
and trod a bare spongy soil, something like dry, powdery
peat.&#160;  To my dismay it gave a momentary heave
under me; then presently I saw what seemed the ripple
of an earthquake running on before me, shadowy in
the low moon.&#160;  It passed into the distance; but,
while yet I stared after it, a single wave rose up,
and came slowly toward me.&#160;  A yard or two away
it burst, and from it, with a scramble and a bound,
issued an animal like a tiger.&#160;  About his mouth
and ears hung clots of mould, and his eyes winked
and flamed as he rushed at me, showing his white teeth
in a soundless snarl.&#160;  I stood fascinated, unconscious
of either courage or fear.&#160;  He turned his head
to the ground, and plunged into it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That moon is affecting my brain,&#8221;
I said as I resumed my journey.&#160; &#8220;What life
can be here but the phantasmic&#8212;&#173;the stuff
of which dreams are made?&#160;  I am indeed walking
in a vain show!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Thus I strove to keep my heart above
the waters of fear, nor knew that she whom I distrusted
was indeed my defence from the realities I took for
phantoms:&#160; her light controlled the monsters, else
had I scarce taken a second step on the hideous ground.&#160;
 &#8220;I will not be appalled by that which only
seems!&#8221; I said to myself, yet felt it a terrible
thing to walk on a sea where such fishes disported
themselves below.&#160;  With that, a step or two from
me, the head of a worm began to come slowly out of
the earth, as big as that of a polar bear and much
resembling it, with a white mane to its red neck.&#160;
The drawing wriggles with which its huge length extricated
itself were horrible, yet I dared not turn my eyes
from them.&#160;  The moment its tail was free, it
lay as if exhausted, wallowing in feeble effort to
burrow again.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Does it live on the dead,&#8221;
I wondered, &#8220;and is it unable to hurt the living?&#160;
 If they scent their prey and come out, why do they
leave me unharmed?&#8221;</p>

<p>I know now it was that the moon paralysed them.</p>

<p align="justify">All the night through as I walked,
hideous creatures, no two alike, threatened me.&#160;
 In some of them, beauty of colour enhanced loathliness
of shape:&#160; one large serpent was covered from head
to distant tail with feathers of glorious hues.</p>

<p align="justify">I became at length so accustomed to
their hurtless menaces that I fell to beguiling the
way with the invention of monstrosities, never suspecting
that I owed each moment of life to the staring moon.&#160;
Though hers was no primal radiance, it so hampered
the evil things, that I walked in safety.&#160;  For
light is yet light, if but the last of a countless
series of reflections!&#160;  How swiftly would not
my feet have carried me over the restless soil, had
I known that, if still within their range when her
lamp ceased to shine on the cursed spot, I should
that moment be at the mercy of such as had no mercy,
the centre of a writhing heap of hideousness, every
individual of it as terrible as before it had but
seemed!&#160;  Fool of ignorance, I watched the descent
of the weary, solemn, anxious moon down the widening
vault above me, with no worse uneasiness than the dread
of losing my way&#8212;&#173;where as yet I had indeed
no way to lose.</p>

<p align="justify">I was drawing near the hills I had
made my goal, and she was now not far from their sky-line,
when the soundless wallowing ceased, and the burrow
lay motionless and bare.&#160;  Then I saw, slowly walking
over the light soil, the form of a woman.&#160;  A
white mist floated about her, now assuming, now losing
to reassume the shape of a garment, as it gathered
to her or was blown from her by a wind that dogged
her steps.</p>

<p align="justify">She was beautiful, but with such a
pride at once and misery on her countenance that I
could hardly believe what yet I saw.&#160;  Up and down
she walked, vainly endeavouring to lay hold of the
mist and wrap it around her.&#160;  The eyes in the
beautiful face were dead, and on her left side was
a dark spot, against which she would now and then press
her hand, as if to stifle pain or sickness.&#160;  Her
hair hung nearly to her feet, and sometimes the wind
would so mix it with the mist that I could not distinguish
the one from the other; but when it fell gathering
together again, it shone a pale gold in the moonlight.</p>

<p align="justify">Suddenly pressing both hands on her
heart, she fell to the ground, and the mist rose from
her and melted in the air.&#160;  I ran to her.&#160;
But she began to writhe in such torture that I stood
aghast.&#160;  A moment more and her legs, hurrying
from her body, sped away serpents. &#62;From her shoulders
fled her arms as in terror, serpents also.&#160;  Then
something flew up from her like a bat, and when I looked
again, she was gone.&#160;  The ground rose like the
sea in a storm; terror laid hold upon me; I turned
to the hills and ran.</p>

<p align="justify">I was already on the slope of their
base, when the moon sank behind one of their summits,
leaving me in its shadow.&#160;  Behind me rose a waste
and sickening cry, as of frustrate desire&#8212;&#173;the
only sound I had heard since the fall of the dead
butterfly; it made my heart shake like a flag in the
wind.&#160;  I turned, saw many dark objects bounding
after me, and made for the crest of a ridge on which
the moon still shone.&#160;  She seemed to linger there
that I might see to defend myself.&#160;  Soon I came
in sight of her, and climbed the faster.</p>

<p align="justify">Crossing the shadow of a rock, I heard
the creatures panting at my heels.&#160;  But just
as the foremost threw himself upon me with a snarl
of greedy hate, we rushed into the moon together.&#160;
 She flashed out an angry light, and he fell from
me a bodiless blotch.&#160;  Strength came to me, and
I turned on the rest.&#160;  But one by one as they
darted into the light, they dropped with a howl; and
I saw or fancied a strange smile on the round face
above me.</p>

<p align="justify">I climbed to the top of the ridge:&#160;
far away shone the moon, sinking to a low horizon.&#160;
 The air was pure and strong.&#160;  I descended a little
way, found it warmer, and sat down to wait the dawn.</p>

<p>The moon went below, and the world again was dark.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XI</h1>

<p><b>THE EVIL WOOD</b></p>

<p align="justify">I fell fast asleep, and when I woke
the sun was rising.&#160;  I went to the top again,
and looked back:&#160; the hollow I had crossed in the
moonlight lay without sign of life.&#160;  Could it
be that the calm expanse before me swarmed with creatures
of devouring greed?</p>

<p align="justify">I turned and looked over the land
through which my way must lie.&#160;  It seemed a wide
desert, with a patch of a different colour in the
distance that might be a forest.&#160;  Sign of presence,
human or animal, was none&#8212;&#173;smoke or dust
or shadow of cultivation.&#160;  Not a cloud floated
in the clear heaven; no thinnest haze curtained any
segment of its circling rim.</p>

<p align="justify">I descended, and set out for the imaginable
forest:&#160; something alive might be there; on this
side of it could not well be anything!</p>

<p align="justify">When I reached the plain, I found
it, as far as my sight could go, of rock, here flat
and channeled, there humped and pinnacled&#8212;&#173;
evidently the wide bed of a vanished river, scored
by innumerable water-runs, without a trace of moisture
in them.&#160;  Some of the channels bore a dry moss,
and some of the rocks a few lichens almost as hard
as themselves.&#160;  The air, once &#8220;filled with
pleasant noise of waters,&#8221; was silent as death.&#160;
 It took me the whole day to reach the patch,&#8212;&#173;
which I found indeed a forest&#8212;&#173;but not a
rudiment of brook or runnel had I crossed!&#160;  Yet
through the glowing noon I seemed haunted by an aural
mirage, hearing so plainly the voice of many waters
that I could hardly believe the opposing testimony
of my eyes.</p>

<p align="justify">The sun was approaching the horizon
when I left the river-bed, and entered the forest.&#160;
 Sunk below the tree-tops, and sending his rays between
their pillar-like boles, he revealed a world of blessed
shadows waiting to receive me.&#160;  I had expected
a pine-wood, but here were trees of many sorts, some
with strong resemblances to trees I knew, others with
marvellous differences from any I had ever seen.&#160;
 I threw myself beneath the boughs of what seemed a
eucalyptus in blossom:&#160; its flowers had a hard
calyx much resembling a skull, the top of which rose
like a lid to let the froth-like bloom-brain overfoam
its cup.&#160;  From beneath the shadow of its falchion-leaves
my eyes went wandering into deep after deep of the
forest.</p>

<p align="justify">Soon, however, its doors and windows
began to close, shutting up aisle and corridor and
roomier glade.&#160;  The night was about me, and instant
and sharp the cold.&#160;  Again what a night I found
it!&#160;  How shall I make my reader share with me
its wild ghostiness?</p>

<p align="justify">The tree under which I lay rose high
before it branched, but the boughs of it bent so low
that they seemed ready to shut me in as I leaned against
the smooth stem, and let my eyes wander through the
brief twilight of the vanishing forest.&#160;  Presently,
to my listless roving gaze, the varied outlines of
the clumpy foliage began to assume or imitate&#8212;&#173;say
rather <i>suggest</i> other shapes than their own.&#160;
 A light wind began to blow; it set the boughs of a
neighbour tree rocking, and all their branches aswing,
every twig and every leaf blending its individual
motion with the sway of its branch and the rock of
its bough.&#160;  Among its leafy shapes was a pack
of wolves that struggled to break from a wizard&#8217;s
leash:&#160; greyhounds would not have strained so
savagely!&#160;  I watched them with an interest that
grew as the wind gathered force, and their motions
life.</p>

<p align="justify">Another mass of foliage, larger and
more compact, presented my fancy with a group of horses&#8217;
heads and forequarters projecting caparisoned from
their stalls.&#160;  Their necks kept moving up and
down, with an impatience that augmented as the growing
wind broke their vertical rhythm with a wilder swaying
from side to side.&#160;  What heads they were! how
gaunt, how strange!&#8212;&#173;several of them bare
skulls&#8212;&#173;one with the skin tight on its bones!&#160;
 One had lost the under jaw and hung low, looking
unutterably weary&#8212;&#173;but now and then hove
high as if to ease the bit.&#160;  Above them, at the
end of a branch, floated erect the form of a woman,
waving her arms in imperious gesture.&#160;  The definiteness
of these and other leaf masses first surprised and
then discomposed me:&#160; what if they should overpower
my brain with seeming reality?&#160;  But the twilight
became darkness; the wind ceased; every shape was
shut up in the night; I fell asleep.</p>

<p align="justify">It was still dark when I began to
be aware of a far-off, confused, rushing noise, mingled
with faint cries.&#160;  It grew and grew until a tumult
as of gathering multitudes filled the wood.&#160;  On
all sides at once the sounds drew nearer; the spot
where I lay seemed the centre of a commotion that
extended throughout the forest.&#160;  I scarce moved
hand or foot lest I should betray my presence to hostile
things.</p>

<p align="justify">The moon at length approached the
forest, and came slowly into it:&#160; with her first
gleam the noises increased to a deafening uproar,
and I began to see dim shapes about me.&#160;  As she
ascended and grew brighter, the noises became yet
louder, and the shapes clearer.&#160;  A furious battle
was raging around me.&#160;  Wild cries and roars of
rage, shock of onset, struggle prolonged, all mingled
with words articulate, surged in my ears.&#160;  Curses
and credos, snarls and sneers, laughter and mockery,
sacred names and howls of hate, came huddling in chaotic
interpenetration.&#160;  Skeletons and phantoms fought
in maddest confusion.&#160; Swords swept through the
phantoms:&#160; they only shivered.&#160;  Maces crashed
on the skeletons, shattering them hideously:&#160; not
one fell or ceased to fight, so long as a single joint
held two bones together.&#160;  Bones of men and horses
lay scattered and heaped; grinding and crunching them
under foot fought the skeletons.&#160;  Everywhere charged
the bone-gaunt white steeds; everywhere on foot or
on wind-blown misty battle-horses, raged and ravened
and raved the indestructible spectres; weapons and
hoofs clashed and crushed; while skeleton jaws and
phantom-throats swelled the deafening tumult with the
war-cry of every opinion, bad or good, that had bred
strife, injustice, cruelty in any world.&#160;  The
holiest words went with the most hating blow.&#160;
 Lie-distorted truths flew hurtling in the wind of
javelins and bones.&#160;  Every moment some one would
turn against his comrades, and fight more wildly than
before, <i>the</i> <i>truth</i>!&#160; <i>The</i> <i>truth</i>!
still his cry.&#160;  One I noted who wheeled ever
in a circle, and smote on all sides.&#160;  Wearied
out, a pair would sit for a minute side by side, then
rise and renew the fierce combat.&#160;  None stooped
to comfort the fallen, or stepped wide to spare him.</p>

<p align="justify">The moon shone till the sun rose,
and all the night long I had glimpses of a woman moving
at her will above the strife-tormented multitude,
now on this front now on that, one outstretched arm
urging the fight, the other pressed against her side.&#160;
 &#8220;Ye are men:&#160; slay one another!&#8221;
she shouted.&#160;  I saw her dead eyes and her dark
spot, and recalled what I had seen the night before.</p>

<p align="justify">Such was the battle of the dead, which
I saw and heard as I lay under the tree.</p>

<p align="justify">Just before sunrise, a breeze went
through the forest, and a voice cried, &#8220;Let
the dead bury their dead!&#8221; At the word the contending
thousands dropped noiseless, and when the sun looked
in, he saw never a bone, but here and there a withered
branch.</p>

<p align="justify">I rose and resumed my journey, through
as quiet a wood as ever grew out of the quiet earth.&#160;
 For the wind of the morning had ceased when the sun
appeared, and the trees were silent.&#160;  Not a bird
sang, not a squirrel, mouse, or weasel showed itself,
not a belated moth flew athwart my path.&#160;  But
as I went I kept watch over myself, nor dared let
my eyes rest on any forest-shape.&#160;  All the time
I seemed to hear faint sounds of mattock and spade
and hurtling bones:&#160; any moment my eyes might
open on things I would not see!&#160;  Daylight prudence
muttered that perhaps, to appear, ten thousand phantoms
awaited only my consenting fancy.</p>

<p align="justify">In the middle of the afternoon I came
out of the wood&#8212;&#173;to find before me a second
net of dry water-courses.&#160;  I thought at first
that I had wandered from my attempted line, and reversed
my direction; but I soon saw it was not so, and concluded
presently that I had come to another branch of the
same river-bed.&#160;  I began at once to cross it,
and was in the bottom of a wide channel when the sun
set.</p>

<p align="justify">I sat down to await the moon, and
growing sleepy, stretched myself on the moss.&#160;
 The moment my head was down, I heard the sounds of
rushing streams&#8212;&#173;all sorts of sweet watery
noises.&#160;  The veiled melody of the molten music
sang me into a dreamless sleep, and when I woke the
sun was already up, and the wrinkled country widely
visible.&#160; Covered with shadows it lay striped
and mottled like the skin of some wild animal.&#160;
 As the sun rose the shadows diminished, and it seemed
as if the rocks were re-absorbing the darkness that
had oozed out of them during the night.</p>

<p align="justify">Hitherto I had loved my Arab mare
and my books more, I fear, than live man or woman;
now at length my soul was athirst for a human presence,
and I longed even after those inhabitants of this alien
world whom the raven had so vaguely described as nearest
my sort.&#160; With heavy yet hoping heart, and mind
haunted by a doubt whether I was going in any direction
at all, I kept wearily travelling &#8220;north-west
and by south.&#8221;</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XII</h1>

<p><b>FRIENDS AND FOES</b></p>

<p align="justify">Coming, in one of the channels, upon
what seemed a little shrub, the outlying picket, I
trusted, of an army behind it, I knelt to look at
it closer.&#160;  It bore a small fruit, which, as I
did not recognise it, I feared to gather and eat.&#160;
 Little I thought that I was watched from behind the
rocks by hundreds of eyes eager with the question
whether I would or would not take it.</p>

<p align="justify">I came to another plant somewhat bigger,
then to another larger still, and at length to clumps
of a like sort; by which time I saw that they were
not shrubs but dwarf-trees.&#160;  Before I reached
the bank of this second branch of the river-bed, I
found the channels so full of them that it was with
difficulty I crossed such as I could not jump.&#160;
 In one I heard a great rush, as of a multitude of
birds from an ivied wall, but saw nothing.</p>

<p align="justify">I came next to some large fruit-bearing
trees, but what they bore looked coarse.&#160;  They
stood on the edge of a hollow, which evidently had
once been the basin of a lake.&#160;  From the left
a forest seemed to flow into and fill it; but while
the trees above were of many sorts, those in the hollow
were almost entirely fruit-bearing.</p>

<p align="justify">I went a few yards down the slope
of grass mingled with moss, and stretched myself upon
it weary.&#160;  A little farther down stood a tiny
tree full of rosiest apples no bigger than small cherries,
its top close to my hand; I pulled and ate one of them.&#160;
 Finding it delicious, I was in the act of taking
another, when a sudden shouting of children, mingled
with laughter clear and sweet as the music of a brook,
startled me with delight.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He likes our apples!&#160; 
He likes our apples!&#160;  He&#8217;s a good giant!&#160;
He&#8217;s a good giant!&#8221; cried many little voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a giant!&#8221; objected one.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He <i>is</i> rather big,&#8221;
assented another, &#8220;but littleness isn&#8217;t
everything!&#160;  It won&#8217;t keep you from growing
big and stupid except you take care!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I rose on my elbow and stared.&#160;
 Above and about and below me stood a multitude of
children, apparently of all ages, some just able to
run alone, and some about twelve or thirteen.&#160;
 Three or four seemed older.&#160;  They stood in a
small knot, a little apart, and were less excited
than the rest.&#160;  The many were chattering in groups,
declaiming and contradicting, like a crowd of grown
people in a city, only with greater merriment, better
manners, and more sense.</p>

<p align="justify">I gathered that, by the approach of
my hand to a second apple, they knew that I liked
the first; but how from that they argued me good,
I did not see, nor wondered that one of them at least
should suggest caution.&#160;  I did not open my mouth,
for I was afraid of frightening them, and sure I should
learn more by listening than by asking questions.&#160;
 For I understood nearly all they said&#8212;&#173;at
which I was not surprised:&#160; to understand is not
more wonderful than to love.</p>

<p align="justify">There came a movement and slight dispersion
among them, and presently a sweet, innocent-looking,
lovingly roguish little fellow handed me a huge green
apple.&#160;  Silence fell on the noisy throng; all
waited expectant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat, good giant,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p align="justify">I sat up, took the apple, smiled thanks,
and would have eaten; but the moment I bit into it,
I flung it far away.</p>

<p align="justify">Again rose a shout of delight; they
flung themselves upon me, so as nearly to smother
me; they kissed my face and hands; they laid hold
of my legs; they clambered about my arms and shoulders,
embracing my head and neck.&#160;  I came to the ground
at last, overwhelmed with the lovely little goblins.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Good, good giant!&#8221; they
cried.&#160;  &#8220;We knew you would come!&#160;  Oh
you dear, good, strong giant!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The babble of their talk sprang up
afresh, and ever the jubilant shout would rise anew
from hundreds of clear little throats.</p>

<p align="justify">Again came a sudden silence.&#160;
 Those around me drew back; those atop of me got off
and began trying to set me on my feet.&#160;  Upon their
sweet faces, concern had taken the place of merriment.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Get up, good giant!&#8221;
said a little girl.&#160;  &#8220;Make haste! much haste!&#160;
He saw you throw his apple away!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Before she ended, I was on my feet.&#160;
 She stood pointing up the slope.&#160;  On the brow
of it was a clownish, bad-looking fellow, a few inches
taller than myself.&#160;  He looked hostile, but I
saw no reason to fear him, for he had no weapon, and
my little friends had vanished every one.</p>

<p align="justify">He began to descend, and I, in the
hope of better footing and position, to go up.&#160;
 He growled like a beast as he turned toward me.</p>

<p align="justify">Reaching a more level spot, I stood
and waited for him.&#160;  As he came near, he held
out his hand.&#160;  I would have taken it in friendly
fashion, but he drew it back, threatened a blow, and
held it out again.&#160;  Then I understood him to
claim the apple I had flung away, whereupon I made
a grimace of dislike and a gesture of rejection.</p>

<p align="justify">He answered with a howl of rage that
seemed to say, &#8220;Do you dare tell me my apple
was not fit to eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One bad apple may grow on the best tree,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p align="justify">Whether he perceived my meaning I
cannot tell, but he made a stride nearer, and I stood
on my guard.&#160;  He delayed his assault, however,
until a second giant, much like him, who had been stealing
up behind me, was close enough, when he rushed upon
me.&#160;  I met him with a good blow in the face,
but the other struck me on the back of the head, and
between them I was soon overpowered.</p>

<p align="justify">They dragged me into the wood above
the valley, where their tribe lived&#8212;&#173;in
wretched huts, built of fallen branches and a few stones.&#160;
Into one of these they pushed me, there threw me on
the ground, and kicked me.&#160;  A woman was present,
who looked on with indifference.</p>

<p align="justify">I may here mention that during my
captivity I hardly learned to distinguish the women
from the men, they differed so little.&#160;  Often
I wondered whether I had not come upon a sort of fungoid
people, with just enough mind to give them motion
and the expressions of anger and greed.&#160;  Their
food, which consisted of tubers, bulbs, and fruits,
was to me inexpressibly disagreeable, but nothing offended
them so much as to show dislike to it.&#160;  I was
cuffed by the women and kicked by the men because
I would not swallow it.</p>

<p align="justify">I lay on the floor that night hardly
able to move, but I slept a good deal, and woke a
little refreshed.&#160;  In the morning they dragged
me to the valley, and tying my feet, with a long rope,
to a tree, put a flat stone with a saw-like edge in
my left hand.&#160;  I shifted it to the right; they
kicked me, and put it again in the left; gave me to
understand that I was to scrape the bark off every
branch that had no fruit on it; kicked me once more,
and left me.</p>

<p align="justify">I set about the dreary work in the
hope that by satisfying them I should be left very
much to myself&#8212;&#173;to make my observations and
choose my time for escape.&#160;  Happily one of the
dwarf-trees grew close by me, and every other minute
I plucked and ate a small fruit, which wonderfully
refreshed and strengthened me.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XIII</h1>

<p><b>THE LITTLE ONES</b></p>

<p align="justify">I had been at work but a few moments,
when I heard small voices near me, and presently the
Little Ones, as I soon found they called themselves,
came creeping out from among the tiny trees that like
brushwood filled the spaces between the big ones.&#160;
 In a minute there were scores and scores about me.&#160;
 I made signs that the giants had but just left me,
and were not far off; but they laughed, and told me
the wind was quite clean.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They are too blind to see us,&#8221;
they said, and laughed like a multitude of sheep-bells.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like that rope about your ankles?&#8221;
asked one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want them to think I cannot take it off,&#8221;
I replied.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They can scarcely see their
own feet!&#8221; he rejoined.&#160;  &#8220;Walk with
short steps and they will think the rope is all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he danced with merriment.</p>

<p align="justify">One of the bigger girls got down on
her knees to untie the clumsy knot.&#160;  I smiled,
thinking those pretty fingers could do nothing with
it, but in a moment it was loose.</p>

<p align="justify">They then made me sit down, and fed
me with delicious little fruits; after which the smaller
of them began to play with me in the wildest fashion,
so that it was impossible for me to resume my work.&#160;
 When the first grew tired, others took their places,
and this went on until the sun was setting, and heavy
steps were heard approaching.&#160; The little people
started from me, and I made haste to put the rope
round my ankles.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We must have a care,&#8221;
said the girl who had freed me; &#8220;a crush of
one of their horrid stumpy feet might kill a very little
one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can they not perceive you at all then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They might see something move;
and if the children were in a heap on the top of you,
as they were a moment ago, it would be terrible; for
they hate every live thing but themselves.&#8212;&#173;Not
that they are much alive either!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She whistled like a bird.&#160;  The
next instant not one of them was to be seen or heard,
and the girl herself had disappeared.</p>

<p align="justify">It was my master, as doubtless he
counted himself, come to take me home.&#160;  He freed
my ankles, and dragged me to the door of his hut;
there he threw me on the ground, again tied my feet,
gave me a kick, and left me.</p>

<p align="justify">Now I might at once have made my escape;
but at length I had friends, and could not think of
leaving them.&#160;  They were so charming, so full
of winsome ways, that I must see more of them!&#160;
 I must know them better!&#160;  &#8220;To-morrow,&#8221;
I said to myself with delight, &#8220;I shall see
them again!&#8221; But from the moment there was silence
in the huts until I fell asleep, I heard them whispering
all about me, and knew that I was lovingly watched
by a multitude.&#160;  After that, I think they hardly
ever left me quite alone.</p>

<p align="justify">I did not come to know the giants
at all, and I believe there was scarcely anything
in them to know.&#160;  They never became in the least
friendly, but they were much too stupid to invent cruelties.&#160;
 Often I avoided a bad kick by catching the foot and
giving its owner a fall, upon which he never, on that
occasion, renewed his attempt.</p>

<p align="justify">But the little people were constantly
doing and saying things that pleased, often things
that surprised me.&#160;  Every day I grew more loath
to leave them.&#160;  While I was at work, they would
keep coming and going, amusing and delighting me,
and taking all the misery, and much of the weariness
out of my monotonous toil.&#160;  Very soon I loved
them more than I can tell.&#160;  They did not know
much, but they were very wise, and seemed capable
of learning anything.&#160;  I had no bed save the bare
ground, but almost as often as I woke, it was in a
nest of children&#8212;&#173; one or other of them
in my arms, though which I seldom could tell until
the light came, for they ordered the succession among
themselves.&#160;  When one crept into my bosom, unconsciously
I clasped him there, and the rest lay close around
me, the smaller nearer.&#160;  It is hardly necessary
to say that I did not suffer much from the nightly
cold!&#160;  The first thing they did in the morning,
and the last before sunset, was to bring the good
giant plenty to eat.</p>

<p align="justify">One morning I was surprised on waking
to find myself alone.&#160;  As I came to my senses,
however, I heard subdued sounds of approach, and presently
the girl already mentioned, the tallest and gravest
of the community, and regarded by all as their mother,
appeared from the wood, followed by the multitude
in jubilation manifest&#8212;&#173;but silent lest
they should rouse the sleeping giant at whose door
I lay.&#160;  She carried a boy-baby in her arms:&#160;
hitherto a girl-baby, apparently about a year old,
had been the youngest.&#160;  Three of the bigger girls
were her nurses, but they shared their treasure with
all the rest.&#160;  Among the Little Ones, dolls were
unknown; the bigger had the smaller, and the smaller
the still less, to tend and play with.</p>

<p align="justify">Lona came to me and laid the infant
in my arms.&#160;  The baby opened his eyes and looked
at me, closed them again, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;He loves you already!&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you find him?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In the wood, of course,&#8221;
she answered, her eyes beaming with delight, &#8220;&#8212;&#173;where
we always find them.&#160;  Isn&#8217;t he a beauty?&#160;
 We&#8217;ve been out all night looking for him.&#160;
 Sometimes it is not easy to find!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know when there is one to find?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot tell,&#8221; she replied.&#160;
 &#8220;Every one makes haste to tell the other, but
we never find out who told first.&#160;  Sometimes I
think one must have said it asleep, and another heard
it half-awake.&#160;  When there is a baby in the wood,
no one can stop to ask questions; and when we have
found it, then it is too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do more boy or girl babies come to the wood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t come to the wood; we go to
the wood and find them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there more boys or girls of you now?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had found that to ask precisely
the same question twice, made them knit their brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can count them, surely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We never do that.&#160;  We shouldn&#8217;t
like to be counted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be smooth.&#160;  We would
rather not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do the babies come from first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the wood&#8212;&#173;always.&#160;  There
is no other place they can come from.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She knew where they came from last,
and thought nothing else was to be known about their
advent.</p>

<p>&#8220;How often do you find one?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Such a happy thing takes all
the glad we&#8217;ve got, and we forget the last time.&#160;
 You too are glad to have him&#8212;&#173;are you not,
good giant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, I am!&#8221; I answered.&#160;
 &#8220;But how do you feed him?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will show you,&#8221; she
rejoined, and went away&#8212;&#173;to return directly
with two or three ripe little plums.&#160;  She put
one to the baby&#8217;s lips.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He would open his mouth if
he were awake,&#8221; she said, and took him in her
arms.</p>

<p align="justify">She squeezed a drop to the surface,
and again held the fruit to the baby&#8217;s lips.&#160;
 Without waking he began at once to suck it, and she
went on slowly squeezing until nothing but skin and
stone were left.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There!&#8221; she cried, in
a tone of gentle triumph.&#160;  &#8220;A big-apple
world it would be with nothing for the babies!&#160;
 We wouldn&#8217;t stop in it&#8212;&#173; would we,
darling?&#160;  We would leave it to the bad giants!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But what if you let the stone
into the baby&#8217;s mouth when you were feeding
him?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No mother would do that,&#8221;
she replied.&#160;  &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be fit
to have a baby!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I thought what a lovely woman she
would grow.&#160;  But what became of them when they
grew up?&#160;  Where did they go?&#160;  That brought
me again to the question&#8212;&#173;where did they
come from first?</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me where you lived before?&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you <i>never</i> lived anywhere else?&#8221;
I ventured.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Never.&#160;  We all came from
the wood.&#160;  Some think we dropped out of the trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it there are so many of you quite little?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#160;
 Some are less and some are bigger.&#160;  I am very
big.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baby will grow bigger, won&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And will you grow bigger?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#160;
 I hope not.&#160;  I am the biggest.&#160;  It frightens
me sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should it frighten you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave me no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are you?&#8221; I resumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know what you mean.&#160;  We are all
just that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How big will the baby grow?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot tell.&#8212;&#173;Some,&#8221;
she added, with a trouble in her voice, &#8220;begin
to grow after we think they have stopped.&#8212;&#173;That
is a frightful thing.&#160;  We don&#8217;t talk about
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes it frightful?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, then answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;We fear they may be beginning to grow giants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you fear that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it is so terrible.&#8212;&#173;I don&#8217;t
want to talk about it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She pressed the baby to her bosom
with such an anxious look that I dared not further
question her.</p>

<p align="justify">Before long I began to perceive in
two or three of the smaller children some traces of
greed and selfishness, and noted that the bigger girls
cast on these a not infrequent glance of anxiety.</p>

<p align="justify">None of them put a hand to my work:&#160;
they would do nothing for the giants!&#160;  But they
never relaxed their loving ministrations to me.&#160;
They would sing to me, one after another, for hours;
climb the tree to reach my mouth and pop fruit into
it with their dainty little fingers; and they kept
constant watch against the approach of a giant.</p>

<p align="justify">Sometimes they would sit and tell
me stories&#8212;&#173;mostly very childish, and often
seeming to mean hardly anything.&#160;  Now and then
they would call a general assembly to amuse me.&#160;
 On one such occasion a moody little fellow sang me
a strange crooning song, with a refrain so pathetic
that, although unintelligible to me, it caused the
tears to run down my face.&#160;  This phenomenon made
those who saw it regard me with much perplexity.&#160;
 Then first I bethought myself that I had not once,
in that world, looked on water, falling or lying or
running.&#160;  Plenty there had been in some long vanished
age&#8212;&#173;that was plain enough&#8212;&#173;but
the Little Ones had never seen any before they saw
my tears!&#160;  They had, nevertheless, it seemed,
some dim, instinctive perception of their origin;
for a very small child went up to the singer, shook
his clenched pud in his face, and said something like
this:&#160; &#8220;&#8217;Ou skeeze ze juice out of
ze good giant&#8217;s seeberries!&#160;  Bad giant!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How is it,&#8221; I said one
day to Lona, as she sat with the baby in her arms
at the foot of my tree, &#8220;that I never see any
children among the giants?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She stared a little, as if looking
in vain for some sense in the question, then replied,</p>

<p>&#8220;They are giants; there are no little ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have they never any children?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No; there are never any in
the wood for them.&#160;  They do not love them.&#160;
 If they saw ours, they would stamp them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Is there always the same number
of the giants then?&#160;  I thought, before I had
time to know better, that they were your fathers and
mothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>She burst into the merriest laughter, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;No, good giant; <i>we</i> are <i>their</i> firsters.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But as she said it, the merriment
died out of her, and she looked scared.</p>

<p>I stopped working, and gazed at her, bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;How <i>can</i> that be?&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not say; I do not understand,&#8221;
she answered.&#160;  &#8220;But we were here and they
not.&#160;  They go from us.&#160;  I am sorry, but we
cannot help it.&#160;  <i>They</i> could have helped
it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How long have you been here?&#8221;
I asked, more and more puzzled&#8212;&#173;in the hope
of some side-light on the matter.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Always, I think,&#8221; she
replied.&#160;  &#8220;I think somebody made us always.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned to my scraping.</p>

<p>She saw I did not understand.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The giants were not made always,&#8221;
she resumed.&#160;  &#8220;If a Little One doesn&#8217;t
care, he grows greedy, and then lazy, and then big,
and then stupid, and then bad.&#160;  The dull creatures
don&#8217;t know that they come from us.&#160;  Very
few of them believe we are anywhere.&#160;  They say
<i>nonsense</i>!&#8212;&#173;Look at little Blunty:&#160;
he is eating one of their apples!&#160; He will be
the next!&#160;  Oh! oh! he will soon be big and bad
and ugly, and not know it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The child stood by himself a little
way off, eating an apple nearly as big as his head.&#160;
 I had often thought he did not look so good as the
rest; now he looked disgusting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take the horrid thing from him!&#8221;
I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is no use,&#8221; she answered
sadly.&#160;  &#8220;We have done all we can, and it
is too late!&#160;  We were afraid he was growing, for
he would not believe anything told him; but when he
refused to share his berries, and said he had gathered
them for himself, then we knew it!&#160;  He is a glutton,
and there is no hope of him.&#8212;&#173;It makes me
sick to see him eat!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Could not some of the boys
watch him, and not let him touch the poisonous things?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He may have them if he will:&#160;
it is all one&#8212;&#173;to eat the apples, and to
be a boy that would eat them if he could.&#160;  No;
he must go to the giants!&#160;  He belongs to them.&#160;
 You can see how much bigger he is than when first
you came!&#160;  He is bigger since yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He is as like that hideous
green lump in his hand as boy could look!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It suits what he is making himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His head and it might change places!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he want to be a giant?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He hates the giants, but he
is making himself one all the same:&#160; he likes
their apples!&#160;  Oh baby, baby, he was just such
a darling as you when we found him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be very miserable when he finds himself
a giant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; he will like it well enough!&#160; 
That is the worst of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he hate the Little Ones?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He will be like the rest; he
will not remember us&#8212;&#173;most likely will not
believe there are Little Ones.&#160;  He will not care;
he will eat his apples.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Do tell me how it will come
about.&#160;  I understand your world so little!&#160;
 I come from a world where everything is different.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not know about <i>world</i>.&#160;
 What is it?&#160;  What more but a word in your beautiful
big mouth?&#8212;&#173;That makes it something!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Never mind about the word;
tell me what next will happen to Blunty.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He will wake one morning and
find himself a giant&#8212;&#173;not like you, good
giant, but like any other bad giant.&#160;  You will
hardly know him, but I will tell you which.&#160; 
He will think he has been a giant always, and will
not know you, or any of us.&#160;  The giants have lost
themselves, Peony says, and that is why they never
smile.&#160;  I wonder whether they are not glad because
they are bad, or bad because they are not glad.&#160;
But they can&#8217;t be glad when they have no babies!&#160;
 I wonder what <i>bad</i> means, good giant!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I wish I knew no more about
it than you!&#8221; I returned.&#160;  &#8220;But I
try to be good, and mean to keep on trying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I&#8212;&#173;and that is how I know you
are good.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long pause followed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then you do not know where
the babies come from into the wood?&#8221; I said,
making one attempt more.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is nothing to know there,&#8221;
she answered.&#160;  &#8220;They are in the wood; they
grow there.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then how is it you never find
one before it is quite grown?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She knitted her brows and was silent a moment:&#160;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not there till they&#8217;re
finished,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is a pity the little sillies
can&#8217;t speak till they&#8217;ve forgotten everything
they had to tell!&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Little Tolma, the last before
this baby, looked as if she had something to tell,
when I found her under a beech-tree, sucking her thumb,
but she hadn&#8217;t.&#160;  She only looked up at me&#8212;&#173;oh,
so sweetly!&#160; <i>She</i> will never go bad and grow
big!&#160;  When they begin to grow big they care for
nothing but bigness; and when they cannot grow any
bigger, they try to grow fatter.&#160;  The bad giants
are very proud of being fat.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So they are in my world,&#8221;
I said; &#8220;only they do not say <i>fat</i> there,
they say <i>rich</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In one of their houses,&#8221;
continued Lona, &#8220;sits the biggest and fattest
of them&#8212;&#173;so proud that nobody can see him;
and the giants go to his house at certain times, and
call out to him, and tell him how fat he is, and beg
him to make them strong to eat more and grow fat like
him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The rumour at length reached my ears
that Blunty had vanished.&#160;  I saw a few grave
faces among the bigger ones, but he did not seem to
be much missed.</p>

<p>The next morning Lona came to me and whispered,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Look! look there&#8212;&#173;by
that quince-tree:&#160; that is the giant that was
Blunty!&#8212;&#173;Would you have known him?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Never,&#8221; I answered. 
&#8220;&#8212;&#173;But now you tell me, I could fancy
it might be Blunty staring through a fog!&#160;  He
<i>does</i> look stupid!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He is for ever eating those
apples now!&#8221; she said.&#160;  &#8220;That is what
comes of Little Ones that <i>won&#8217;t</i> be little!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They call it growing-up in
my world!&#8221; I said to myself.&#160;  &#8220;If
only she would teach me to grow the other way, and
become a Little One!&#8212;&#173;Shall I ever be able
to laugh like them?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had had the chance, and had flung
it from me!&#160;  Blunty and I were alike!&#160;  He
did not know his loss, and I had to be taught mine!</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1>

<p><b>A CRISIS</b></p>

<p align="justify">For a time I had no desire save to
spend my life with the Little Ones.&#160;  But soon
other thoughts and feelings began to influence me.&#160;
First awoke the vague sense that I ought to be doing
something; that I was not meant for the fattening
of boors!&#160;  Then it came to me that I was in a
marvellous world, of which it was assuredly my business
to discover the ways and laws; and that, if I would
do anything in return for the children&#8217;s goodness,
I must learn more about them than they could tell
me, and to that end must be free.&#160;  Surely, I
thought, no suppression of their growth can be essential
to their loveliness and truth and purity!&#160;  Not
in any world could the possibility exist of such a
discord between constitution and its natural outcome!&#160;
 Life and law cannot be so at variance that perfection
must be gained by thwarting development!&#160;  But
the growth of the Little Ones <i>was</i> arrested! something
interfered with it:&#160; what was it?&#160;  Lona seemed
the eldest of them, yet not more than fifteen, and
had been long in charge of a multitude, in semblance
and mostly in behaviour merest children, who regarded
her as their mother!&#160;  Were they growing at all?&#160;
 I doubted it.&#160;  Of time they had scarcely the
idea; of their own age they knew nothing!&#160;  Lona
herself thought she had lived always!&#160;  Full of
wisdom and empty of knowledge, she was at once their
Love and their Law!&#160;  But what seemed to me her
ignorance might in truth be my own lack of insight!&#160;
 Her one anxiety plainly was, that her Little Ones
should not grow, and change into bad giants!&#160;
 Their &#8220;good giant&#8221; was bound to do his
best for them:&#160; without more knowledge of their
nature, and some knowledge of their history, he could
do nothing, and must therefore leave them!&#160;  They
would only be as they were before; they had in no way
become dependent on me; they were still my protectors,
I was not theirs; my presence but brought them more
in danger of their idiotic neighbours!&#160;  I longed
to teach them many things:&#160; I must first understand
more of those I would teach!&#160;  Knowledge no doubt
made bad people worse, but it must make good people
better!&#160;  I was convinced they would learn mathematics;
and might they not be taught to write down the dainty
melodies they murmured and forgot?</p>

<p align="justify">The conclusion was, that I must rise
and continue my travels, in the hope of coming upon
some elucidation of the fortunes and destiny of the
bewitching little creatures.</p>

<p align="justify">My design, however, would not so soon
have passed into action, but for what now occurred.</p>

<p align="justify">To prepare them for my temporary absence,
I was one day telling them while at work that I would
long ago have left the bad giants, but that I loved
the Little Ones so much&#8212;&#173;when, as by one
accord, they came rushing and crowding upon me; they
scrambled over each other and up the tree and dropped
on my head, until I was nearly smothered.&#160;  With
three very little ones in my arms, one on each shoulder
clinging to my neck, one standing straight up on my
head, four or five holding me fast by the legs, others
grappling my body and arms, and a multitude climbing
and descending upon these, I was helpless as one overwhelmed
by lava.&#160;  Absorbed in the merry struggle, not
one of them saw my tyrant coming until he was almost
upon me.&#160; With just one cry of &#8220;Take care,
good giant!&#8221; they ran from me like mice, they
dropped from me like hedgehogs, they flew from me up
the tree like squirrels, and the same moment, sharp
round the stem came the bad giant, and dealt me such
a blow on the head with a stick that I fell to the
ground.&#160;  The children told me afterwards that
they sent him &#8220;such a many bumps of big apples
and stones&#8221; that he was frightened, and ran
blundering home.</p>

<p align="justify">When I came to myself it was night.&#160;
 Above me were a few pale stars that expected the
moon.&#160;  I thought I was alone.&#160;  My head ached
badly, and I was terribly athirst.</p>

<p align="justify">I turned wearily on my side.&#160;
 The moment my ear touched the ground, I heard the
gushing and gurgling of water, and the soft noises
made me groan with longing.&#160;  At once I was amid
a multitude of silent children, and delicious little
fruits began to visit my lips.&#160;  They came and
came until my thirst was gone.</p>

<p align="justify">Then I was aware of sounds I had never
heard there before; the air was full of little sobs.</p>

<p align="justify">I tried to sit up.&#160;  A pile of
small bodies instantly heaped itself at my back.&#160;
 Then I struggled to my feet, with much pushing and
pulling from the Little Ones, who were wonderfully
strong for their size.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You must go away, good giant,&#8221;
they said.&#160;  &#8220;When the bad giants see you
hurt, they will all trample on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I must,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and grow strong, and come again,&#8221;
they said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; I replied&#8212;&#173;and sat
down.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Indeed you must go at once!&#8221;
whispered Lona, who had been supporting me, and now
knelt beside me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I listened at his door,&#8221;
said one of the bigger boys, &#8220;and heard the
bad giant say to his wife that he had found you idle,
talking to a lot of moles and squirrels, and when
he beat you, they tried to kill him.&#160;  He said
you were a wizard, and they must knock you, or they
would have no peace.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will go at once,&#8221; I
said, &#8220;and come back as soon as I have found
out what is wanted to make you bigger and stronger.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be bigger,&#8221;
they answered, looking very serious.&#160; &#8220;We
<i>won&#8217;t</i> grow bad giants!&#8212;&#173;We are
strong now; you don&#8217;t know how much strong!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It was no use holding them out a prospect
that had not any attraction for them!&#160;  I said
nothing more, but rose and moved slowly up the slope
of the valley.&#160;  At once they formed themselves
into a long procession; some led the way, some walked
with me helping me, and the rest followed.&#160;  They
kept feeding me as we went.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are broken,&#8221; they
said, &#8220;and much red juice has run out of you:&#160;
put some in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">When we reached the edge of the valley,
there was the moon just lifting her forehead over
the rim of the horizon.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She has come to take care of
you, and show you the way,&#8221; said Lona.</p>

<p align="justify">I questioned those about me as we
walked, and learned there was a great place with a
giant-girl for queen.&#160;  When I asked if it was
a city, they said they did not know.&#160;  Neither
could they tell how far off, or in what direction
it was, or what was the giant-girl&#8217;s name; all
they knew was, that she hated the Little Ones, and
would like to kill them, only she could not find them.&#160;
 I asked how they knew that; Lona answered that she
had always known it.&#160;  If the giant-girl came
to look for them, they must hide hard, she said.&#160;
 When I told them I should go and ask her why she
hated them, they cried out,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No, no! she will kill you,
good giant; she will kill you!&#160;  She is an awful
bad-giant witch!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I asked them where I was to go then.&#160;
 They told me that, beyond the baby-forest, away where
the moon came from, lay a smooth green country, pleasant
to the feet, without rocks or trees.&#160;  But when
I asked how I was to set out for it,</p>

<p>&#8220;The moon will tell you, we think,&#8221; they
said.</p>

<p align="justify">They were taking me up the second
branch of the river bed:&#160; when they saw that the
moon had reached her height, they stopped to return.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We have never gone so far from
our trees before,&#8221; they said.&#160;  &#8220;Now
mind you watch how you go, that you may see inside
your eyes how to come back to us.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And beware of the giant-woman
that lives in the desert,&#8221; said one of the bigger
girls as they were turning, &#8220;I suppose you have
heard of her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then take care not to go near
her.&#160;  She is called the Cat-woman.&#160; She is
awfully ugly&#8212;&#173;<i>and</i> <i>scratches</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As soon as the bigger ones stopped,
the smaller had begun to run back.&#160;  The others
now looked at me gravely for a moment, and then walked
slowly away.&#160;  Last to leave me, Lona held up the
baby to be kissed, gazed in my eyes, whispered, &#8220;The
Cat-woman will not hurt <i>you</i>,&#8221; and went
without another word.&#160;  I stood a while, gazing
after them through the moonlight, then turned and,
with a heavy heart, began my solitary journey.&#160;
 Soon the laughter of the Little Ones overtook me,
like sheep-bells innumerable, rippling the air, and
echoing in the rocks about me.&#160;  I turned again,
and again gazed after them:&#160; they went gamboling
along, with never a care in their sweet souls.&#160;
 But Lona walked apart with her baby.</p>

<p align="justify">Pondering as I went, I recalled many
traits of my little friends.</p>

<p align="justify">Once when I suggested that they should
leave the country of the bad giants, and go with me
to find another, they answered, &#8220;But that would
be to <i>not</i> ourselves!&#8221;&#8212;&#173;so strong
in them was the love of place that their country seemed
essential to their very being!&#160;  Without ambition
or fear, discomfort or greed, they had no motive to
desire any change; they knew of nothing amiss; and,
except their babies, they had never had a chance of
helping any one but myself:&#8212;&#173;How were they
to grow?&#160;  But again, Why should they grow?&#160;
 In seeking to improve their conditions, might I not
do them harm, and only harm?&#160; To enlarge their
minds after the notions of my world&#8212;&#173;might
it not be to distort and weaken them?&#160;  Their
fear of growth as a possible start for gianthood might
be instinctive!</p>

<p align="justify">The part of philanthropist is indeed
a dangerous one; and the man who would do his neighbour
good must first study how not to do him evil, and
must begin by pulling the beam out of his own eye.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XV</h1>

<p><b>A STRANGE HOSTESS</b></p>

<p align="justify">I travelled on attended by the moon.&#160;
 As usual she was full&#8212;&#173;I had never seen
her other&#8212;&#173;and to-night as she sank I thought
I perceived something like a smile on her countenance.</p>

<p align="justify">When her under edge was a little below
the horizon, there appeared in the middle of her disc,
as if it had been painted upon it, a cottage, through
the open door and window of which she shone; and with
the sight came the conviction that I was expected there.&#160;
 Almost immediately the moon was gone, and the cottage
had vanished; the night was rapidly growing dark,
and my way being across a close succession of small
ravines, I resolved to remain where I was and expect
the morning.&#160;  I stretched myself, therefore, in
a sandy hollow, made my supper off the fruits the
children had given me at parting, and was soon asleep.</p>

<p align="justify">I woke suddenly, saw above me constellations
unknown to my former world, and had lain for a while
gazing at them, when I became aware of a figure seated
on the ground a little way from and above me.&#160;
 I was startled, as one is on discovering all at once
that he is not alone.&#160;  The figure was between
me and the sky, so that I saw its outline well.&#160;
 From where I lay low in the hollow, it seemed larger
than human.</p>

<p align="justify">It moved its head, and then first
I saw that its back was toward me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Will you not come with me?&#8221;
said a sweet, mellow voice, unmistakably a woman&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Wishing to learn more of my hostess,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; I replied,
&#8220;but I am not uncomfortable here.&#160;  Where
would you have me go?&#160;  I like sleeping in the
open air.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is no hurt in the air,&#8221;
she returned; &#8220;but the creatures that roam the
night in these parts are not such as a man would willingly
have about him while he sleeps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not been disturbed,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I have been sitting by you ever since you
lay down.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is very kind of you!&#160;
 How came you to know I was here?&#160;  Why do you
show me such favour?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I saw you,&#8221; she answered,
still with her back to me, &#8220;in the light of
the moon, just as she went down.&#160;  I see badly
in the day, but at night perfectly.&#160;  The shadow
of my house would have hidden you, but both its doors
were open.&#160;  I was out on the waste, and saw you
go into this hollow.&#160;  You were asleep, however,
before I could reach you, and I was not willing to
disturb you.&#160;  People are frightened if I come
on them suddenly.&#160;  They call me the Cat-woman.&#160;
 It is not my name.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I remembered what the children had
told me&#8212;&#173;that she was very ugly, and scratched.&#160;
 But her voice was gentle, and its tone a little apologetic:&#160;
she could not be a bad giantess!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You shall not hear it from
me,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;Please tell me what
I <i>may</i> call you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;When you know me, call me by
the name that seems to you to fit me,&#8221; she replied:&#160;
&#8220;that will tell me what sort you are.&#160;  People
do not often give me the right one.&#160;  It is well
when they do.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I suppose, madam, you live
in the cottage I saw in the heart of the moon?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do.&#160;  I live there alone,
except when I have visitors.&#160;  It is a poor place,
but I do what I can for my guests, and sometimes their
sleep is sweet to them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Her voice entered into me, and made
me feel strangely still.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go with you, madam,&#8221; I said, rising.</p>

<p align="justify">She rose at once, and without a glance
behind her led the way.&#160;  I could see her just
well enough to follow.&#160;  She was taller than myself,
but not so tall as I had thought her.&#160;  That she
never turned her face to me made me curious&#8212;&#173;nowise
apprehensive, her voice rang so true.&#160;  But how
was I to fit her with a name who could not see her?&#160;
I strove to get alongside of her, but failed:&#160;
when I quickened my pace she quickened hers, and kept
easily ahead of me.&#160;  At length I did begin to
grow a little afraid.&#160;  Why was she so careful
not to be seen?&#160;  Extraordinary ugliness would
account for it:&#160; she might fear terrifying me!&#160;
 Horror of an inconceivable monstrosity began to assail
me:&#160; was I following through the dark an unheard
of hideousness?&#160; Almost I repented of having accepted
her hospitality.</p>

<p align="justify">Neither spoke, and the silence grew
unbearable.&#160;  I <i>must</i> break it!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I want to find my way,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;to a place I have heard of, but whose
name I have not yet learned.&#160;  Perhaps you can
tell it me!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Describe it, then, and I will
direct you.&#160;  The stupid Bags know nothing, and
the careless little Lovers forget almost everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do those live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are just come from them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard those names before!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not hear them.&#160;  Neither people
knows its own name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Perhaps so! but hardly any
one anywhere knows his own name!&#160;  It would make
many a fine gentleman stare to hear himself addressed
by what is really his name!&#8221;</p>

<p>I held my peace, beginning to wonder what my name
might be.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What now do you fancy yours?&#8221;
she went on, as if aware of my thought.&#160; &#8220;But,
pardon me, it is a matter of no consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had actually opened my mouth to
answer her, when I discovered that my name was gone
from me.&#160;  I could not even recall the first letter
of it!&#160;  This was the second time I had been asked
my name and could not tell it!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;it is not wanted.&#160;  Your real name, indeed,
is written on your forehead, but at present it whirls
about so irregularly that nobody can read it.&#160;
 I will do my part to steady it.&#160;  Soon it will
go slower, and, I hope, settle at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>This startled me, and I was silent.</p>

<p align="justify">We had left the channels and walked
a long time, but no sign of the cottage yet appeared.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The Little Ones told me,&#8221;
I said at length, &#8220;of a smooth green country,
pleasant to the feet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she returned.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They told me too of a girl
giantess that was queen somewhere:&#160; is that her
country?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is a city in that grassy
land,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;where a woman is
princess.&#160;  The city is called Bulika.&#160;  But
certainly the princess is not a girl!&#160;  She is
older than this world, and came to it from yours&#8212;&#173;with
a terrible history, which is not over yet.&#160;  She
is an evil person, and prevails much with the Prince
of the Power of the Air.&#160;  The people of Bulika
were formerly simple folk, tilling the ground and
pasturing sheep.&#160;  She came among them, and they
received her hospitably.&#160;  She taught them to
dig for diamonds and opals and sell them to strangers,
and made them give up tillage and pasturage and build
a city.&#160;  One day they found a huge snake and killed
it; which so enraged her that she declared herself
their princess, and became terrible to them.&#160;
 The name of the country at that time was <i>the</i>
<i>land</i> <i>of</i> <i>waters</i>; for the dry channels,
of which you have crossed so many, were then overflowing
with live torrents; and the valley, where now the
Bags and the Lovers have their fruit-trees, was a lake
that received a great part of them.&#160;  But the wicked
princess gathered up in her lap what she could of
the water over the whole country, closed it in an
egg, and carried it away.&#160;  Her lap, however, would
not hold more than half of it; and the instant she
was gone, what she had not yet taken fled away underground,
leaving the country as dry and dusty as her own heart.&#160;
 Were it not for the waters under it, every living
thing would long ago have perished from it.&#160;  For
where no water is, no rain falls; and where no rain
falls, no springs rise.&#160;  Ever since then, the
princess has lived in Bulika, holding the inhabitants
in constant terror, and doing what she can to keep
them from multiplying.&#160;  Yet they boast and believe
themselves a prosperous, and certainly are a self-satisfied
people&#8212;&#173;good at bargaining and buying, good
at selling and cheating; holding well together for
a common interest, and utterly treacherous where interests
clash; proud of their princess and her power, and despising
every one they get the better of; never doubting themselves
the most honourable of all the nations, and each man
counting himself better than any other.&#160;  The
depth of their worthlessness and height of their vainglory
no one can understand who has not been there to see,
who has not learned to know the miserable misgoverned
and self-deceived creatures.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I thank you, madam.&#160;  And
now, if you please, will you tell me something about
the Little Ones&#8212;&#173;the Lovers?&#160;  I long
heartily to serve them.&#160;  Who and what are they?
and how do they come to be there?&#160; Those children
are the greatest wonder I have found in this world
of wonders.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In Bulika you may, perhaps,
get some light on those matters.&#160;  There is an
ancient poem in the library of the palace, I am told,
which of course no one there can read, but in which
it is plainly written that after the Lovers have gone
through great troubles and learned their own name,
they will fill the land, and make the giants their
slaves.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By that time they will have
grown a little, will they not?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, they will have grown;
yet I think too they will not have grown.&#160; It
is possible to grow and not to grow, to grow less and
to grow bigger, both at once&#8212;&#173;yes, even
to grow by means of not growing!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your words are strange, madam!&#8221;
I rejoined.&#160;  &#8220;But I have heard it said
that some words, because they mean more, appear to
mean less!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is true, and such words
<i>have</i> to be understood.&#160;  It were well for
the princess of Bulika if she heard what the very silence
of the land is shouting in her ears all day long!&#160;
 But she is far too clever to understand anything.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then I suppose, when the little
Lovers are grown, their land will have water again?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not exactly so:&#160; when they
are thirsty enough, they will have water, and when
they have water, they will grow.&#160;  To grow, they
must have water.&#160;  And, beneath, it is flowing
still.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have heard that water twice,&#8221;
I said; &#8220;&#8212;&#173;once when I lay down to
wait for the moon&#8212;&#173;and when I woke the sun
was shining! and once when I fell, all but killed
by the bad giant.&#160;  Both times came the voices
of the water, and healed me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The woman never turned her head, and
kept always a little before me, but I could hear every
word that left her lips, and her voice much reminded
me of the woman&#8217;s in the house of death.&#160;
 Much of what she said, I did not understand, and
therefore cannot remember.&#160;  But I forgot that
I had ever been afraid of her.</p>

<p align="justify">We went on and on, and crossed yet
a wide tract of sand before reaching the cottage.&#160;
 Its foundation stood in deep sand, but I could see
that it was a rock.&#160;  In character the cottage
resembled the sexton&#8217;s, but had thicker walls.&#160;
 The door, which was heavy and strong, opened immediately
into a large bare room, which had two little windows
opposite each other, without glass.&#160;  My hostess
walked in at the open door out of which the moon had
looked, and going straight to the farthest corner,
took a long white cloth from the floor, and wound
it about her head and face.&#160;  Then she closed the
other door, in at which the moon had looked, trimmed
a small horn lantern that stood on the hearth, and
turned to receive me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are very welcome, Mr. Vane!&#8221;
she said, calling me by the name I had forgotten.&#160;
 &#8220;Your entertainment will be scanty, but, as
the night is not far spent, and the day not at hand,
it is better you should be indoors.&#160;  Here you
will be safe, and a little lack is not a great misery.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I thank you heartily, madam,&#8221;
I replied.&#160;  &#8220;But, seeing you know the name
I could not tell you, may I not now know yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Mara,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>Then I remembered the sexton and the little black
cat.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Some people,&#8221; she went
on, &#8220;take me for Lot&#8217;s wife, lamenting
over Sodom; and some think I am Rachel, weeping for
her children; but I am neither of those.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I thank you again, Mara,&#8221;
I said.  &#8220;&#8212;&#173;May I lie here on your
floor till the morning?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;At the top of that stair,&#8221;
she answered, &#8220;you will find a bed&#8212;&#173;on
which some have slept better than they expected, and
some have waked all the night and slept all the next
day.&#160;  It is not a very soft one, but it is better
than the sand&#8212;&#173;and there are no hyenas sniffing
about it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The stair, narrow and steep, led straight
up from the room to an unceiled and unpartitioned
garret, with one wide, low dormer window.&#160; Close
under the sloping roof stood a narrow bed, the sight
of which with its white coverlet made me shiver, so
vividly it recalled the couches in the chamber of
death.&#160;  On the table was a dry loaf, and beside
it a cup of cold water.&#160;  To me, who had tasted
nothing but fruit for months, they were a feast.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I must leave you in the dark,&#8221;
my hostess called from the bottom of the stair.&#160;
 &#8220;This lantern is all the light I have, and there
are things to do to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is of no consequence, thank
you, madam,&#8221; I returned.&#160;  &#8220;To eat
and drink, to lie down and sleep, are things that can
be done in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rest in peace,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p align="justify">I ate up the loaf, drank the water
every drop, and laid myself down.&#160; The bed was
hard, the covering thin and scanty, and the night cold:&#160;
I dreamed that I lay in the chamber of death, between
the warrior and the lady with the healing wound.</p>

<p align="justify">I woke in the middle of the night,
thinking I heard low noises of wild animals.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Creatures of the desert scenting
after me, I suppose!&#8221; I said to myself, and,
knowing I was safe, would have gone to sleep again.&#160;
 But that instant a rough purring rose to a howl under
my window, and I sprang from my bed to see what sort
of beast uttered it.</p>

<p align="justify">Before the door of the cottage, in
the full radiance of the moon, a tall woman stood,
clothed in white, with her back toward me.&#160;  She
was stooping over a large white animal like a panther,
patting and stroking it with one hand, while with
the other she pointed to the moon half-way up the
heaven, then drew a perpendicular line to the horizon.&#160;
 Instantly the creature darted off with amazing swiftness
in the direction indicated.&#160;  For a moment my eyes
followed it, then sought the woman; but she was gone,
and not yet had I seen her face!&#160; Again I looked
after the animal, but whether I saw or only fancied
a white speck in the distance, I could not tell.&#8212;&#173;What
did it mean?&#160; What was the monster-cat sent off
to do?&#160;  I shuddered, and went back to my bed.&#160;
 Then I remembered that, when I lay down in the sandy
hollow outside, the moon was setting; yet here she
was, a few hours after, shining in all her glory!&#160;
 &#8220;Everything is uncertain here,&#8221; I said
to myself, &#8220;&#8212;&#173;even the motions of the
heavenly bodies!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I learned afterward that there were
several moons in the service of this world, but the
laws that ruled their times and different orbits I
failed to discover.</p>

<p>Again I fell asleep, and slept undisturbed.</p>

<p align="justify">When I went down in the morning, I
found bread and water waiting me, the loaf so large
that I ate only half of it.&#160;  My hostess sat muffled
beside me while I broke my fast, and except to greet
me when I entered, never opened her mouth until I
asked her to instruct me how to arrive at Bulika.&#160;
 She then told me to go up the bank of the river-bed
until it disappeared; then verge to the right until
I came to a forest&#8212;&#173;in which I might spend
a night, but which I must leave with my face to the
rising moon.&#160;  Keeping in the same direction, she
said, until I reached a running stream, I must cross
that at right angles, and go straight on until I saw
the city on the horizon.</p>

<p align="justify">I thanked her, and ventured the remark
that, looking out of the window in the night, I was
astonished to see her messenger understand her so
well, and go so straight and so fast in the direction
she had indicated.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If I had but that animal of
yours to guide me&#8212;&#173;&#8221; I went on, hoping
to learn something of its mission, but she interrupted
me, saying,</p>

<p>&#8220;It was to Bulika she went&#8212;&#173;the shortest
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How wonderfully intelligent she looked!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Astarte knows her work well
enough to be sent to do it,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you many messengers like her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As many as I require.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they hard to teach?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They need no teaching.&#160;
 They are all of a certain breed, but not one of the
breed is like another.&#160;  Their origin is so natural
it would seem to you incredible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I not know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A new one came to me last night&#8212;&#173;from
your head while you slept.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;All in this world seem to love
mystery!&#8221; I said to myself.&#160;  &#8220;Some
chance word of mine suggested an idea&#8212;&#173;and
in this form she embodies the small fact!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the creature is mine!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not at all!&#8221; she answered.&#160;
 &#8220;That only can be ours in whose existence our
will is a factor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! a metaphysician too!&#8221; I remarked
inside, and was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I take what is left of the loaf?&#8221;
I asked presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will want no more to-day,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow I may!&#8221; I rejoined.</p>

<p>She rose and went to the door, saying as she went,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It has nothing to do with to-morrow&#8212;&#173;but
you may take it if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She opened the door, and stood holding
it.&#160;  I rose, taking up the bread&#8212;&#173;but
lingered, much desiring to see her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must I go, then?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one sleeps in my house two nights together!&#8221;
she answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I thank you, then, for your
hospitality, and bid you farewell!&#8221; I said,
and turned to go.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The time will come when you
must house with me many days and many nights,&#8221;
she murmured sadly through her muffling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Willingly,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, <i>not</i> willingly!&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p align="justify">I said to myself that she was right&#8212;&#173;I
would not willingly be her guest a second time! but
immediately my heart rebuked me, and I had scarce
crossed the threshold when I turned again.</p>

<p align="justify">She stood in the middle of the room;
her white garments lay like foamy waves at her feet,
and among them the swathings of her face:&#160; it
was lovely as a night of stars.&#160;  Her great gray
eyes looked up to heaven; tears were flowing down
her pale cheeks.&#160;  She reminded me not a little
of the sexton&#8217;s wife, although the one looked
as if she had not wept for thousands of years, and
the other as if she wept constantly behind the wrappings
of her beautiful head.&#160;  Yet something in the
very eyes that wept seemed to say, &#8220;Weeping may
endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had bowed my head for a moment,
about to kneel and beg her forgiveness, when, looking
up in the act, I found myself outside a doorless house.&#160;
 I went round and round it, but could find no entrance.</p>

<p align="justify">I had stopped under one of the windows,
on the point of calling aloud my repentant confession,
when a sudden wailing, howling scream invaded my ears,
and my heart stood still.&#160;  Something sprang from
the window above my head, and lighted beyond me.&#160;
 I turned, and saw a large gray cat, its hair on end,
shooting toward the river-bed.&#160; I fell with my
face in the sand, and seemed to hear within the house
the gentle sobbing of one who suffered but did not
repent.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1>

<p><b>A GRUESOME DANCE</b></p>

<p align="justify">I rose to resume my journey, and walked
many a desert mile.&#160;  How I longed for a mountain,
or even a tall rock, from whose summit I might see
across the dismal plain or the dried-up channels to
some bordering hope!&#160;  Yet what could such foresight
have availed me?&#160; That which is within a man,
not that which lies beyond his vision, is the main
factor in what is about to befall him:&#160; the operation
upon him is the event.&#160;  Foreseeing is not understanding,
else surely the prophecy latent in man would come
oftener to the surface!</p>

<p align="justify">The sun was half-way to the horizon
when I saw before me a rugged rocky ascent; but ere
I reached it my desire to climb was over, and I longed
to lie down.&#160;  By that time the sun was almost
set, and the air had begun to grow dark.&#160;  At
my feet lay a carpet of softest, greenest moss, couch
for a king:&#160; I threw myself upon it, and weariness
at once began to ebb, for, the moment my head was down,
the third time I heard below me many waters, playing
broken airs and ethereal harmonies with the stones
of their buried channels.&#160; Loveliest chaos of
music-stuff the harp aquarian kept sending up to my
ears!&#160;  What might not a H&#228;ndel have done with
that ever-recurring gurgle and bell-like drip, to
the mingling and mutually destructive melodies their
common refrain!</p>

<p align="justify">As I lay listening, my eyes went wandering
up and down the rocky slope abrupt above me, reading
on its face the record that down there, ages ago,
rushed a cataract, filling the channels that had led
me to its foot.&#160;  My heart swelled at the thought
of the splendid tumult, where the waves danced revelling
in helpless fall, to mass their music in one organ-roar
below.&#160;  But soon the hidden brooks lulled me
to sleep, and their lullabies mingled with my dreams.</p>

<p align="justify">I woke before the sun, and eagerly
climbed to see what lay beyond.&#160; Alas, nothing
but a desert of finest sand!&#160;  Not a trace was
left of the river that had plunged adown the rocks!&#160;
 The powdery drift had filled its course to the level
of the dreary expanse!&#160;  As I looked back I saw
that the river had divided into two branches as it
fell, that whose bank I had now followed to the foot
of the rocky scaur, and that which first I crossed
to the Evil Wood.&#160;  The wood I descried between
the two on the far horizon.&#160;  Before me and to
the left, the desert stretched beyond my vision, but
far to the right I could see a lift in the sky-line,
giving hope of the forest to which my hostess had
directed me.</p>

<p align="justify">I sat down, and sought in my pocket
the half-loaf I had brought with me&#8212;&#173;then
first to understand what my hostess had meant concerning
it.&#160;  Verily the bread was not for the morrow:&#160;
it had shrunk and hardened to a stone!&#160;  I threw
it away, and set out again.</p>

<p align="justify">About noon I came to a few tamarisk
and juniper trees, and then to a few stunted firs.&#160;
 As I went on, closer thickets and larger firs met
me, and at length I was in just such a forest of pines
and other trees as that in which the Little Ones found
their babies, and believed I had returned upon a farther
portion of the same.&#160;  But what mattered <i>where</i>
while <i>everywhere</i> was the same as <i>nowhere</i>!&#160;
 I had not yet, by doing something in it, made <i>anywhere</i>
into a place!&#160;  I was not yet alive; I was only
dreaming I lived!&#160;  I was but a consciousness
with an outlook!&#160;  Truly I had been nothing else
in the world I had left, but now I knew the fact!&#160;
 I said to myself that if in this forest I should
catch the faint gleam of the mirror, I would turn
far aside lest it should entrap me unawares, and give
me back to my old existence:&#160; here I might learn
to be something by doing something!&#160;  I could
not endure the thought of going back, with so many
beginnings and not an end achieved.&#160;  The Little
Ones would meet what fate was appointed them; the
awful witch I should never meet; the dead would ripen
and arise without me; I should but wake to know that
I had dreamed, and that all my going was nowhither!&#160;
 I would rather go on and on than come to such a close!</p>

<p align="justify">I went deeper into the wood:&#160;
I was weary, and would rest in it.</p>

<p align="justify">The trees were now large, and stood
in regular, almost geometric, fashion, with roomy
spaces between.&#160;  There was little undergrowth,
and I could see a long way in every direction.&#160;
 The forest was like a great church, solemn and silent
and empty, for I met nothing on two feet or four that
day.&#160;  Now and then, it is true, some swift thing,
and again some slow thing, would cross the space on
which my eye happened that moment to settle; but it
was always at some distance, and only enhanced the
sense of wideness and vacancy.&#160;  I heard a few
birds, and saw plenty of butterflies, some of marvellously
gorgeous colouring and combinations of colour, some
of a pure and dazzling whiteness.</p>

<p align="justify">Coming to a spot where the pines stood
farther apart and gave room for flowering shrubs,
and hoping it a sign of some dwelling near, I took
the direction where yet more and more roses grew, for
I was hungry after the voice and face of my kind&#8212;&#173;after
any live soul, indeed, human or not, which I might
in some measure understand.&#160; What a hell of horror,
I thought, to wander alone, a bare existence never
going out of itself, never widening its life in another
life, but, bound with the cords of its poor peculiarities,
lying an eternal prisoner in the dungeon of its own
being!&#160;  I began to learn that it was impossible
to live for oneself even, save in the presence of
others&#8212;&#173;then, alas, fearfully possible! evil
was only through good! selfishness but a parasite
on the tree of life!&#160;  In my own world I had the
habit of solitary song; here not a crooning murmur
ever parted my lips!&#160;  There I sang without thinking;
here I thought without singing! there I had never
had a bosom-friend; here the affection of an idiot
would be divinely welcome!&#160;  &#8220;If only I had
a dog to love!&#8221; I sighed&#8212;&#173;and regarded
with wonder my past self, which preferred the company
of book or pen to that of man or woman; which, if
the author of a tale I was enjoying appeared, would
wish him away that I might return to his story.&#160;
 I had chosen the dead rather than the living, the
thing thought rather than the thing thinking!&#160;
 &#8220;Any man,&#8221; I said now, &#8220;is more
than the greatest of books!&#8221;  I had not cared
for my live brothers and sisters, and now I was left
without even the dead to comfort me!</p>

<p align="justify">The wood thinned yet more, and the
pines grew yet larger, sending up huge stems, like
columns eager to support the heavens.&#160;  More trees
of other kinds appeared; the forest was growing richer!&#160;
 The roses wore now trees, and their flowers of astonishing
splendour.</p>

<p align="justify">Suddenly I spied what seemed a great
house or castle; but its forms were so strangely indistinct,
that I could not be certain it was more than a chance
combination of tree-shapes.&#160;  As I drew nearer,
its lines yet held together, but neither they nor the
body of it grew at all more definite; and when at
length I stood in front of it, I remained as doubtful
of its nature as before.&#160;  House or castle habitable,
it certainly was not; it might be a ruin overgrown
with ivy and roses!&#160;  Yet of building hid in the
foliage, not the poorest wall-remnant could I discern.&#160;
 Again and again I seemed to descry what must be building,
but it always vanished before closer inspection.&#160;
Could it be, I pondered, that the ivy had embraced
a huge edifice and consumed it, and its interlaced
branches retained the shapes of the walls it had assimilated?&#8212;&#173;I
could be sure of nothing concerning the appearance.</p>

<p align="justify">Before me was a rectangular vacancy&#8212;&#173;the
ghost of a doorway without a door:&#160; I stepped
through it, and found myself in an open space like
a great hall, its floor covered with grass and flowers,
its walls and roof of ivy and vine, mingled with roses.</p>

<p align="justify">There could be no better place in
which to pass the night!&#160;  I gathered a quantity
of withered leaves, laid them in a corner, and threw
myself upon them.&#160;  A red sunset filled the hall,
the night was warm, and my couch restful; I lay gazing
up at the live ceiling, with its tracery of branches
and twigs, its clouds of foliage, and peeping patches
of loftier roof.&#160;  My eyes went wading about as
if tangled in it, until the sun was down, and the
sky beginning to grow dark.&#160;  Then the red roses
turned black, and soon the yellow and white alone
were visible.&#160;  When they vanished, the stars came
instead, hanging in the leaves like live topazes,
throbbing and sparkling and flashing many colours:&#160;
I was canopied with a tree from Aladdin&#8217;s cave!</p>

<p align="justify">Then I discovered that it was full
of nests, whence tiny heads, nearly indistinguishable,
kept popping out with a chirp or two, and disappearing
again.&#160;  For a while there were rustlings and stirrings
and little prayers; but as the darkness grew, the small
heads became still, and at last every feathered mother
had her brood quiet under her wings, the talk in the
little beds was over, and God&#8217;s bird-nursery
at rest beneath the waves of sleep.&#160;  Once more
a few flutterings made me look up:&#160; an owl went
sailing across.&#160;  I had only a glimpse of him,
but several times felt the cool wafture of his silent
wings.&#160;  The mother birds did not move again; they
saw that he was looking for mice, not children.</p>

<p align="justify">About midnight I came wide awake,
roused by a revelry, whose noises were yet not loud.&#160;
 Neither were they distant; they were close to me,
but attenuate.&#160;  My eyes were so dazzled, however,
that for a while I could see nothing; at last they
came to themselves.</p>

<p align="justify">I was lying on my withered leaves
in the corner of a splendid hall.&#160; Before me was
a crowd of gorgeously dressed men and gracefully robed
women, none of whom seemed to see me.&#160;  In dance
after dance they vaguely embodied the story of life,
its meetings, its passions, its partings.&#160;  A
student of Shakspere, I had learned something of every
dance alluded to in his plays, and hence partially
understood several of those I now saw&#8212;&#173;the
minuet, the pavin, the hey, the coranto, the lavolta.&#160;
 The dancers were attired in fashion as ancient as
their dances.</p>

<p align="justify">A moon had risen while I slept, and
was shining through the countless-windowed roof; but
her light was crossed by so many shadows that at first
I could distinguish almost nothing of the faces of
the multitude; I could not fail, however, to perceive
that there was something odd about them:&#160; I sat
up to see them better.&#8212;&#173;Heavens! could I
call them faces?&#160;  They were skull fronts! &#8212;&#173;hard,
gleaming bone, bare jaws, truncated noses, lipless
teeth which could no more take part in any smile!&#160;
 Of these, some flashed set and white and murderous;
others were clouded with decay, broken and gapped,
coloured of the earth in which they seemed so long
to have lain!&#160;  Fearfuller yet, the eye-sockets
were not empty; in each was a lidless living eye!&#160;
 In those wrecks of faces, glowed or flashed or sparkled
eyes of every colour, shape, and expression.&#160; 
The beautiful, proud eye, dark and lustrous, condescending
to whatever it rested upon, was the more terrible;
the lovely, languishing eye, the more repulsive; while
the dim, sad eyes, less at variance with their setting,
were sad exceedingly, and drew the heart in spite of
the horror out of which they gazed.</p>

<p align="justify">I rose and went among the apparitions,
eager to understand something of their being and belongings.&#160;
 Were they souls, or were they and their rhythmic
motions but phantasms of what had been?&#160;  By look
nor by gesture, not by slightest break in the measure,
did they show themselves aware of me; I was not present
to them:&#160; how much were they in relation to each
other?&#160;  Surely they saw their companions as I
saw them!&#160;  Or was each only dreaming itself and
the rest?&#160; Did they know each how they appeared
to the others&#8212;&#173;a death with living eyes?&#160;
 Had they used their faces, not for communication,
not to utter thought and feeling, not to share existence
with their neighbours, but to appear what they wished
to appear, and conceal what they were? and, having
made their faces masks, were they therefore deprived
of those masks, and condemned to go without faces
until they repented?</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How long must they flaunt their
facelessness in faceless eyes?&#8221; I wondered.&#160;
 &#8220;How long will the frightful punition endure?&#160;
 Have they at length begun to love and be wise?&#160;
 Have they yet yielded to the shame that has found
them?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I heard not a word, saw not a movement
of one naked mouth.&#160;  Were they because of lying
bereft of speech?&#160;  With their eyes they spoke
as if longing to be understood:&#160; was it truth or
was it falsehood that spoke in their eyes?&#160;  They
seemed to know one another:&#160; did they see one
skull beautiful, and another plain?&#160;  Difference
must be there, and they had had long study of skulls!</p>

<p align="justify">My body was to theirs no obstacle:&#160;
was I a body, and were they but forms? or was I but
a form, and were they bodies?&#160;  The moment one
of the dancers came close against me, that moment he
or she was on the other side of me, and I could tell,
without seeing, which, whether man or woman, had passed
through my house.</p>

<p align="justify">On many of the skulls the hair held
its place, and however dressed, or in itself however
beautiful, to my eyes looked frightful on the bones
of the forehead and temples.&#160;  In such case, the
outer ear often remained also, and at its tip, the
jewel of the ear as Sidney calls it, would hang, glimmering,
gleaming, or sparkling, pearl or opal or diamond&#8212;&#173;under
the night of brown or of raven locks, the sunrise
of golden ripples, or the moonshine of pale, interclouded,
fluffy cirri&#8212;&#173;lichenous all on the ivory-white
or damp-yellow naked bone.&#160;  I looked down and
saw the daintily domed instep; I looked up and saw
the plump shoulders basing the spring of the round
full neck&#8212;&#173;which withered at half-height
to the fluted shaft of a gibbose cranium.</p>

<p align="justify">The music became wilder, the dance
faster and faster; eyes flared and flashed, jewels
twinkled and glittered, casting colour and fire on
the pallid grins that glode through the hall, weaving
a ghastly rhythmic woof in intricate maze of multitudinous
motion, when sudden came a pause, and every eye turned
to the same spot:&#8212;&#173;in the doorway stood
a woman, perfect in form, in holding, and in hue, regarding
the company as from the pedestal of a goddess, while
the dancers stood &#8220;like one forbid,&#8221; frozen
to a new death by the vision of a life that killed.&#160;
 &#8220;Dead things, I live!&#8221; said her scornful
glance.&#160; Then, at once, like leaves in which an
instant wind awakes, they turned each to another,
and broke afresh into melodious consorted motion,
a new expression in their eyes, late solitary, now
filled with the interchange of a common triumph.&#160;
 &#8220;Thou also,&#8221; they seemed to say, &#8220;wilt
soon become weak as we! thou wilt soon become like
unto us!&#8221;  I turned mine again to the woman&#8212;&#173;and
saw upon her side a small dark shadow.</p>

<p align="justify">She had seen the change in the dead
stare; she looked down; she understood the talking
eyes; she pressed both her lovely hands on the shadow,
gave a smothered cry, and fled.&#160;  The birds moved
rustling in their nests, and a flash of joy lit up
the eyes of the dancers, when suddenly a warm wind,
growing in strength as it swept through the place,
blew out every light.&#160;  But the low moon yet glimmered
on the horizon with &#8220;sick assay&#8221; to shine,
and a turbid radiance yet gleamed from so many eyes,
that I saw well enough what followed.&#160; As if each
shape had been but a snow-image, it began to fall to
pieces, ruining in the warm wind.&#160;  In papery flakes
the flesh peeled from its bones, dropping like soiled
snow from under its garments; these fell fluttering
in rags and strips, and the whole white skeleton,
emerging from garment and flesh together, stood bare
and lank amid the decay that littered the floor.&#160;
 A faint rattling shiver went through the naked company;
pair after pair the lamping eyes went out; and the
darkness grew round me with the loneliness.&#160; For
a moment the leaves were still swept fluttering all
one way; then the wind ceased, and the owl floated
silent through the silent night.</p>

<p align="justify">Not for a moment had I been afraid.&#160;
 It is true that whoever would cross the threshold
of any world, must leave fear behind him; but, for
myself, I could claim no part in its absence.&#160;
 No conscious courage was operant in me; simply, I
was not afraid.&#160;  I neither knew why I was not
afraid, nor wherefore I might have been afraid.&#160;
I feared not even fear&#8212;&#173;which of all dangers
is the most dangerous.</p>

<p align="justify">I went out into the wood, at once
to resume my journey.&#160;  Another moon was rising,
and I turned my face toward it.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XVII</h1>

<p><b>A GROTESQUE TRAGEDY</b></p>

<p align="justify">I had not gone ten paces when I caught
sight of a strange-looking object, and went nearer
to know what it might be.&#160;  I found it a mouldering
carriage of ancient form, ruinous but still upright
on its heavy wheels.&#160;  On each side of the pole,
still in its place, lay the skeleton of a horse; from
their two grim white heads ascended the shrivelled
reins to the hand of the skeleton-coachman seated
on his tattered hammer-cloth; both doors had fallen
away; within sat two skeletons, each leaning back
in its corner.</p>

<p align="justify">Even as I looked, they started awake,
and with a cracking rattle of bones, each leaped from
the door next it.&#160;  One fell and lay; the other
stood a moment, its structure shaking perilously; then
with difficulty, for its joints were stiff, crept,
holding by the back of the carriage, to the opposite
side, the thin leg-bones seeming hardly strong enough
to carry its weight, where, kneeling by the other,
it sought to raise it, almost falling itself again
in the endeavour.</p>

<p align="justify">The prostrate one rose at length,
as by a sudden effort, to the sitting posture.&#160;
 For a few moments it turned its yellowish skull to
this side and that; then, heedless of its neighbour,
got upon its feet by grasping the spokes of the hind
wheel.&#160;  Half erected thus, it stood with its
back to the other, both hands holding one of its knee-joints.&#160;
 With little less difficulty and not a few contortions,
the kneeling one rose next, and addressed its companion.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Have you hurt yourself, my
lord?&#8221; it said, in a voice that sounded far-off,
and ill-articulated as if blown aside by some spectral
wind.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; answered
the other, in like but rougher tone.&#160;  &#8220;You
would do nothing to help me, and this cursed knee is
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did my best, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No doubt, my lady, for it was
bad!&#160;  I thought I should never find my feet again!&#8212;&#173;But,
bless my soul, madam! are you out in your bones?&#8221;</p>

<p>She cast a look at herself.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have nothing else to be out
in,&#8221; she returned; &#8220;&#8212;&#173;and <i>you</i>
at least cannot complain!&#160;  But what on earth
does it mean?&#160;  Am I dreaming?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;<i>You</i> may be dreaming, madam&#8212;&#173;I
cannot tell; but this knee of mine forbids me the
grateful illusion.&#8212;&#173;Ha!&#160; I too, I perceive,
have nothing to walk in but bones!&#8212;&#173;Not
so unbecoming to a man, however!&#160; I trust to goodness
they are not <i>my</i> bones! every one aches worse
than another, and this loose knee worst of all!&#160;
 The bed must have been damp&#8212;&#173;and I too
drunk to know it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably, my lord of Cokayne!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What! what!&#8212;&#173;You
make me think I too am dreaming&#8212;&#173;aches and
all!&#160; How do <i>you</i> know the title my roistering
bullies give me?&#160;  I don&#8217;t remember you!&#8212;&#173;Anyhow,
you have no right to take liberties!&#160;  My name
is&#8212;&#173;I am lord&#8212;&#8212;&#173;tut, tut!&#160;
 What do you call me when I&#8217;m&#8212;&#173;I mean
when you are sober?&#160;  I cannot&#8212;&#173;at the
moment,&#8212;&#173;Why, what <i>is</i> my name?&#8212;&#173;I
must have been <i>very</i> drunk when I went to bed!&#160;
 I often am!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You come so seldom to mine,
that I do not know, my lord; but I may take your word
for <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8212;&#173;if for nothing
else!&#8221; &#8220;Hoity toity!&#160;  I never told
you a lie in my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never told me anything but lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my honour!&#8212;&#173;Why, I never saw
the woman before!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew me well enough to lie to, my lord!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do seem to begin to dream
I have met you before, but, upon my oath, there is
nothing to know you by!&#160;  Out of your clothes,
who is to tell who you may not be?&#8212;&#173;One
thing I <i>may</i> swear&#8212;&#173;that I never saw
you so much undressed before!&#8212;&#173;By heaven,
I have no recollection of you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am glad to hear it:&#160;
my recollections of you are the less distasteful!&#8212;&#173;Good
morning, my lord!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She turned away, hobbled, clacking,
a few paces, and stood again.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are just as heartless as&#8212;&#173;as&#8212;&#173;any
other woman, madam!&#8212;&#173;Where in this hell
of a place shall I find my valet?&#8212;&#173;What was
the cursed name I used to call the fool?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He turned his bare noddle this way
and that on its creaking pivot, still holding his
knee with both hands.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will be your valet for once,
my lord,&#8221; said the lady, turning once more to
him.  &#8220;&#8212;&#173;What can I do for you?&#160;
 It is not easy to tell!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tie my leg on, of course, you
fool!&#160;  Can&#8217;t you see it is all but off?&#160;
 Heigho, my dancing days!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She looked about with her eyeless
sockets and found a piece of fibrous grass, with which
she proceeded to bind together the adjoining parts
that had formed the knee.&#160;  When she had done,
he gave one or two carefully tentative stamps.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You used to stamp rather differently,
my lord!&#8221; she said, as she rose from her knees.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Eh? what!&#8212;&#173;Now I
look at you again, it seems to me I used to hate you!&#8212;&#173;Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Naturally, my lord!&#160;  You
hated a good many people!&#8212;&#173;your wife, of
course, among the rest!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, I begin, I be-gin&#8212;&#8212;&#173;
But&#8212;&#173;I must have been a long time somewhere!&#8212;&#173;I
really forget!&#8212;&#173;There! your damned, miserable
bit of grass is breaking!&#8212;&#173;We used to get
on <i>pretty</i> well together&#8212;&#173;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not that I remember, my lord.&#160;
 The only happy moments I had in your company were
scattered over the first week of our marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Was that the way of it?&#160;
 Ha! ha!&#8212;&#173;Well, it&#8217;s over now, thank
goodness!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I wish I could believe it!&#160;
 Why were we sitting there in that carriage together?&#160;
 It wakes apprehension!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we were divorced, my lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly enough:&#160; we are still together!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A sad truth, but capable of
remedy:&#160; the forest seems of some extent!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt!&#160;  I doubt!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am sorry I cannot think of
a compliment to pay you&#8212;&#173;without lying,
that is.&#160;  To judge by your figure and complexion
you have lived hard since I saw you last!&#160;  I
cannot surely be <i>quite</i> so naked as your ladyship!&#8212;&#173;I
beg your pardon, madam!&#160;  I trust you will take
it I am but jesting in a dream!&#160;  It is of no consequence,
however; dreaming or waking, all&#8217;s one&#8212;&#173;all
merest appearance!&#160;  You can&#8217;t be certain
of anything, and that&#8217;s as good as knowing there
is nothing!&#160; Life may teach any fool that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has taught me the fool I was to love you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You were not the only fool
to do that!&#160;  Women had a trick of falling in
love with me:&#8212;&#173;I had forgotten that you were
one of them!&#8221; &#8220;I did love you, my lord&#8212;&#173;a
little&#8212;&#173;at one time!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, there was your mistake,
my lady!&#160;  You should have loved me much, loved
me devotedly, loved me savagely&#8212;&#173;loved me
eternally!&#160; Then I should have tired of you the
sooner, and not hated you so much afterward!&#8212;&#173;But
let bygones be bygones!&#8212;&#173;<i>Where</i> are we?&#160;
Locality is the question!&#160;  To be or not to be,
is <i>not</i> the question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in the other world, I presume!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Granted!&#8212;&#173;but in
which or what sort of other world?&#160;  This can&#8217;t
be hell!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It must:&#160; there&#8217;s
marriage in it!&#160;  You and I are damned in each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then I&#8217;m not like Othello,
damned in a fair wife!&#8212;&#173;Oh, I remember my
Shakspeare, madam!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She picked up a broken branch that
had fallen into a bush, and steadying herself with
it, walked away, tossing her little skull.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Give that stick to me,&#8221;
cried her late husband; &#8220;I want it more than
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She returned him no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to make me beg for it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not at all, my lord.&#160; 
I mean to keep it,&#8221; she replied, continuing
her slow departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it me at once; I mean to have it!&#160;
 I require it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Unfortunately, I think I require
it myself!&#8221; returned the lady, walking a little
quicker, with a sharper cracking of her joints and
clinking of her bones.</p>

<p align="justify">He started to follow her, but nearly
fell:&#160; his knee-grass had burst, and with an oath
he stopped, grasping his leg again.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Come and tie it up properly!&#8221;
he would have thundered, but he only piped and whistled!</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and tie it up instantly!&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>She walked a step or two farther from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear I will not touch you!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Swear on, my lord! there is
no one here to believe you.&#160;  But, pray, do not
lose your temper, or you will shake yourself to pieces,
and where to find string enough to tie up all your
crazy joints, is more than I can tell.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She came back, and knelt once more
at his side&#8212;&#173;first, however, laying the
stick in dispute beyond his reach and within her own.</p>

<p align="justify">The instant she had finished retying
the joint, he made a grab at her, thinking, apparently,
to seize her by the hair; but his hard fingers slipped
on the smooth poll.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Disgusting!&#8221; he muttered,
and laid hold of her upper arm-bone.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You will break it!&#8221; she
said, looking up from her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, then!&#8221; he answered, and began
to strain at it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I shall not tie your leg again
the next time it comes loose!&#8221; she threatened.</p>

<p align="justify">He gave her arm a vicious twist, but
happily her bones were in better condition than his.&#160;
 She stretched her other hand toward the broken branch.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right:&#160; reach me the stick!&#8221;
he grinned.</p>

<p>She brought it round with such a swing that one of
the bones of the sounder leg snapped.&#160;  He fell,
choking with curses.&#160;  The lady laughed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Now you will have to wear splints
always!&#8221; she said; &#8220;such dry bones never
mend!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You devil!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;At your service, my lord!&#160;
 Shall I fetch you a couple of wheel-spokes?&#160;
Neat&#8212;&#173;but heavy, I fear!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He turned his bone-face aside, and
did not answer, but lay and groaned.&#160;  I marvelled
he had not gone to pieces when he fell.&#160;  The
lady rose and walked away&#8212;&#173;not all ungracefully,
I thought.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What can come of it?&#8221;
I said to myself.&#160;  &#8220;These are too wretched
for any world, and this cannot be hell, for the Little
Ones are in it, and the sleepers too!&#160;  What can
it all mean?&#160;  Can things ever come right for
skeletons?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There are words too big for
you and me:&#160; <i>All</i> is one of them, and <i>ever</i>
is another,&#8221; said a voice near me which I knew.</p>

<p>I looked about, but could not see the speaker.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are not in hell,&#8221;
it resumed.&#160;  &#8220;Neither am I in hell.&#160;
 But those skeletons are in hell!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Ere he ended I caught sight of the
raven on the bough of a beech, right over my head.&#160;
 The same moment he left it, and alighting on the
ground, stood there, the thin old man of the library,
with long nose and long coat.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The male was never a gentleman,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;and in the bony stage of retrogression,
with his skeleton through his skin, and his character
outside his manners, does not look like one.&#160; 
The female is less vulgar, and has a little heart.&#160;
 But, the restraints of society removed, you see them
now just as they are and always were!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Mr. Raven, what will become of them,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We shall see,&#8221; he replied.&#160;
 &#8220;In their day they were the handsomest couple
at court; and now, even in their dry bones, they seem
to regard their former repute as an inalienable possession;
to see their faces, however, may yet do something
for them!&#160;  They felt themselves rich too while
they had pockets, but they have already begun to feel
rather pinched!&#160;  My lord used to regard my lady
as a worthless encumbrance, for he was tired of her
beauty and had spent her money; now he needs her to
cobble his joints for him!&#160;  These changes have
roots of hope in them.&#160;  Besides, they cannot now
get far away from each other, and they see none else
of their own kind:&#160; they must at last grow weary
of their mutual repugnance, and begin to love one
another! for love, not hate, is deepest in what Love
`loved into being.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I saw many more of their kind
an hour ago, in the hall close by!&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Of their kind, but not of their
sort,&#8221; he answered.&#160;  &#8220;For many years
these will see none such as you saw last night.&#160;
 Those are centuries in advance of these.&#160;  You
saw that those could even dress themselves a little!&#160;
 It is true they cannot yet retain their clothes so
long as they would&#8212;&#173;only, at present, for
a part of the night; but they are pretty steadily
growing more capable, and will by and by develop faces;
for every grain of truthfulness adds a fibre to the
show of their humanity.&#160;  Nothing but truth can
appear; and whatever is must seem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they upheld by this hope?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They are upheld by hope, but
they do not in the least know their hope; to understand
it, is yet immeasurably beyond them,&#8221; answered
Mr. Raven.</p>

<p align="justify">His unexpected appearance had caused
me no astonishment.&#160;  I was like a child, constantly
wondering, and surprised at nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you come to find me, sir?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; he replied.&#160;
 &#8220;I have no anxiety about you.&#160;  Such as
you always come back to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, please, who am I such as?&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot make my friend the
subject of conversation,&#8221; he answered, with
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when that friend is present!&#8221; I urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I decline the more strongly,&#8221; he rejoined.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when that friend asks you!&#8221; I persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then most positively I refuse,&#8221; he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because he and I would be talking
of two persons as if they were one and the same.&#160;
 Your consciousness of yourself and my knowledge of
you are far apart!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The lapels of his coat flew out, and
the lappets lifted, and I thought the metamorphosis
of HOMO to CORVUS was about to take place before my
eyes.&#160;  But the coat closed again in front of him,
and he added, with seeming inconsequence,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In this world never trust a
person who has once deceived you.&#160; Above all,
never do anything such a one may ask you to do.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will try to remember,&#8221;
I answered; &#8220;&#8212;&#173;but I may forget!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then some evil that is good for you will follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some evil that is not good for you, will not
follow.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The old man seemed to sink to the
ground, and immediately I saw the raven several yards
from me, flying low and fast.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XVIII</h1>

<p><i>Dead</i> <i>or</i> <i>alive</i>?</p>

<p align="justify">I went walking on, still facing the
moon, who, not yet high, was staring straight into
the forest.&#160;  I did not know what ailed her, but
she was dark and dented, like a battered disc of old
copper, and looked dispirited and weary.&#160;  Not
a cloud was nigh to keep her company, and the stars
were too bright for her.&#160;  &#8220;Is this going
to last for ever?&#8221; she seemed to say.&#160; 
She was going one way and I was going the other, yet
through the wood we went a long way together.&#160;
We did not commune much, for my eyes were on the ground;
but her disconsolate look was fixed on me:&#160; I
felt without seeing it.&#160;  A long time we were
together, I and the moon, walking side by side, she
the dull shine, and I the live shadow.</p>

<p align="justify">Something on the ground, under a spreading
tree, caught my eye with its whiteness, and I turned
toward it.&#160;  Vague as it was in the shadow of
the foliage, it suggested, as I drew nearer, a human
body.&#160; &#8220;Another skeleton!&#8221; I said
to myself, kneeling and laying my hand upon it.&#160;
 A body it was, however, and no skeleton, though as
nearly one as body could well be.&#160;  It lay on
its side, and was very cold&#8212;&#173; not cold like
a stone, but cold like that which was once alive, and
is alive no more.&#160;  The closer I looked at it,
the oftener I touched it, the less it seemed possible
it should be other than dead.&#160;  For one bewildered
moment, I fancied it one of the wild dancers, a ghostly
Cinderella, perhaps, that had lost her way home, and
perished in the strange night of an out-of-door world!&#160;
 It was quite naked, and so worn that, even in the
shadow, I could, peering close, have counted without
touching them, every rib in its side.&#160;  All its
bones, indeed, were as visible as if tight-covered
with only a thin elastic leather.&#160;  Its beautiful
yet terrible teeth, unseemly disclosed by the retracted
lips, gleamed ghastly through the dark.&#160;  Its hair
was longer than itself, thick and very fine to the
touch, and black as night.</p>

<p align="justify">It was the body of a tall, probably
graceful woman.&#8212;&#173;How had she come there?&#160;
 Not of herself, and already in such wasted condition,
surely!&#160;  Her strength must have failed her; she
had fallen, and lain there until she died of hunger!&#160;
 But how, even so, could she be thus emaciated?&#160;
 And how came she to be naked?&#160;  Where were the
savages to strip and leave her? or what wild beasts
would have taken her garments?&#160;  That her body
should have been left was not wonderful!</p>

<p align="justify">I rose to my feet, stood, and considered.&#160;
 I must not, could not let her lie exposed and forsaken!&#160;
 Natural reverence forbade it.&#160;  Even the garment
of a woman claims respect; her body it were impossible
to leave uncovered!&#160;  Irreverent eyes might look
on it!&#160;  Brutal claws might toss it about!&#160;
 Years would pass ere the friendly rains washed it
into the soil!&#8212;&#173;But the ground was hard,
almost solid with interlacing roots, and I had but
my bare hands!</p>

<p align="justify">At first it seemed plain that she
had not long been dead:&#160; there was not a sign
of decay about her!&#160;  But then what had the slow
wasting of life left of her to decay?</p>

<p align="justify">Could she be still alive?&#160;  Might
she not?&#160;  What if she were!&#160;  Things went
very strangely in this strange world!&#160;  Even then
there would be little chance of bringing her back,
but I must know she was dead before I buried her!</p>

<p align="justify">As I left the forest-hall, I had spied
in the doorway a bunch of ripe grapes, and brought
it with me, eating as I came:&#160; a few were yet
left on the stalk, and their juice might possibly revive
her!&#160; Anyhow it was all I had with which to attempt
her rescue!&#160;  The mouth was happily a little open;
but the head was in such an awkward position that,
to move the body, I passed my arm under the shoulder
on which it lay, when I found the pine-needles beneath
it warm:&#160; she could not have been any time dead,
and <i>might</i> still be alive, though I could discern
no motion of the heart, or any indication that she
breathed!&#160;  One of her hands was clenched hard,
apparently inclosing something small.&#160;  I squeezed
a grape into her mouth, but no swallowing followed.</p>

<p align="justify">To do for her all I could, I spread
a thick layer of pine-needles and dry leaves, laid
one of my garments over it, warm from my body, lifted
her upon it, and covered her with my clothes and a
great heap of leaves:&#160; I would save the little
warmth left in her, hoping an increase to it when
the sun came back.&#160;  Then I tried another grape,
but could perceive no slightest movement of mouth or
throat.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Doubt,&#8221; I said to myself,
&#8220;may be a poor encouragement to do anything,
but it is a bad reason for doing nothing.&#8221;&#160;
So tight was the skin upon her bones that I dared
not use friction.</p>

<p align="justify">I crept into the heap of leaves, got
as close to her as I could, and took her in my arms.&#160;
 I had not much heat left in me, but what I had I
would share with her!&#160;  Thus I spent what remained
of the night, sleepless, and longing for the sun.&#160;
 Her cold seemed to radiate into me, but no heat to
pass from me to her.</p>

<p align="justify">Had I fled from the beautiful sleepers,
I thought, each on her &#8220;dim, straight&#8221;
silver couch, to lie alone with such a bedfellow!&#160;
 I had refused a lovely privilege:&#160; I was given
over to an awful duty!&#160; Beneath the sad, slow-setting
moon, I lay with the dead, and watched for the dawn.</p>

<p align="justify">The darkness had given way, and the
eastern horizon was growing dimly clearer, when I
caught sight of a motion rather than of anything that
moved&#8212;&#173;not far from me, and close to the
ground.&#160;  It was the low undulating of a large
snake, which passed me in an unswerving line.&#160;
 Presently appeared, making as it seemed for the same
point, what I took for a roebuck-doe and her calf.&#160;
 Again a while, and two creatures like bear-cubs came,
with three or four smaller ones behind them.&#160;
 The light was now growing so rapidly that when, a
few minutes after, a troop of horses went trotting
past, I could see that, although the largest of them
were no bigger than the smallest Shetland pony, they
must yet be full-grown, so perfect were they in form,
and so much had they all the ways and action of great
horses.&#160;  They were of many breeds.&#160;  Some
seemed models of cart-horses, others of chargers,
hunters, racers.&#160;  Dwarf cattle and small elephants
followed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why are the children not here!&#8221;
I said to myself.&#160;  &#8220;The moment I am free
of this poor woman, I must go back and fetch them!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Where were the creatures going?&#160;
 What drew them?&#160;  Was this an exodus, or a morning
habit?&#160;  I must wait for the sun!&#160;  Till he
came I must not leave the woman!&#160; I laid my hand
on the body, and could not help thinking it felt a
trifle warmer.&#160;  It might have gained a little
of the heat I had lost! it could hardly have generated
any!&#160;  What reason for hope there was had not
grown less!</p>

<p align="justify">The forehead of the day began to glow,
and soon the sun came peering up, as if to see for
the first time what all this stir of a new world was
about.&#160;  At sight of his great innocent splendour,
I rose full of life, strong against death.&#160;  Removing
the handkerchief I had put to protect the mouth and
eyes from the pine-needles, I looked anxiously to
see whether I had found a priceless jewel, or but
its empty case.</p>

<p align="justify">The body lay motionless as when I
found it.&#160;  Then first, in the morning light,
I saw how drawn and hollow was the face, how sharp
were the bones under the skin, how every tooth shaped
itself through the lips.&#160;  The human garment was
indeed worn to its threads, but the bird of heaven
might yet be nestling within, might yet awake to motion
and song!</p>

<p align="justify">But the sun was shining on her face!&#160;
 I re-arranged the handkerchief, laid a few leaves
lightly over it, and set out to follow the creatures.&#160;
 Their main track was well beaten, and must have long
been used&#8212;&#173;likewise many of the tracks that,
joining it from both sides, merged in, and broadened
it.&#160;  The trees retreated as I went, and the grass
grew thicker.&#160;  Presently the forest was gone,
and a wide expanse of loveliest green stretched away
to the horizon.&#160; Through it, along the edge of
the forest, flowed a small river, and to this the
track led.&#160;  At sight of the water a new though
undefined hope sprang up in me.&#160;  The stream looked
everywhere deep, and was full to the brim, but nowhere
more than a few yards wide.&#160;  A bluish mist rose
from it, vanishing as it rose.&#160;  On the opposite
side, in the plentiful grass, many small animals were
feeding.&#160;  Apparently they slept in the forest,
and in the morning sought the plain, swimming the
river to reach it.&#160;  I knelt and would have drunk,
but the water was hot, and had a strange metallic
taste.</p>

<p align="justify">I leapt to my feet:&#160; here was
the warmth I sought&#8212;&#173;the first necessity
of life!&#160;  I sped back to my helpless charge.</p>

<p align="justify">Without well considering my solitude,
no one will understand what seemed to lie for me in
the redemption of this woman from death.&#160; &#8220;Prove
what she may,&#8221; I thought with myself, &#8220;I
shall at least be lonely no more!&#8221; I had found
myself such poor company that now first I seemed to
know what hope was.&#160;  This blessed water would
expel the cold death, and drown my desolation!</p>

<p align="justify">I bore her to the stream.&#160;  Tall
as she was, I found her marvellously light, her bones
were so delicate, and so little covered them.&#160;
 I grew yet more hopeful when I found her so far from
stiff that I could carry her on one arm, like a sleeping
child, leaning against my shoulder.&#160;  I went softly,
dreading even the wind of my motion, and glad there
was no other.</p>

<p align="justify">The water was too hot to lay her at
once in it:&#160; the shock might scare from her the
yet fluttering life!&#160;  I laid her on the bank,
and dipping one of my garments, began to bathe the
pitiful form.&#160; So wasted was it that, save from
the plentifulness and blackness of the hair, it was
impossible even to conjecture whether she was young
or old.&#160;  Her eyelids were just not shut, which
made her look dead the more:&#160; there was a crack
in the clouds of her night, at which no sun shone
through!</p>

<p align="justify">The longer I went on bathing the poor
bones, the less grew my hope that they would ever
again be clothed with strength, that ever those eyelids
would lift, and a soul look out; still I kept bathing
continuously, allowing no part time to grow cold while
I bathed another; and gradually the body became so
much warmer, that at last I ventured to submerge it:&#160;
I got into the stream and drew it in, holding the
face above the water, and letting the swift, steady
current flow all about the rest.&#160;  I noted, but
was able to conclude nothing from the fact, that,
for all the heat, the shut hand never relaxed its
hold.</p>

<p align="justify">After about ten minutes, I lifted
it out and laid it again on the bank, dried it, and
covered it as well as I could, then ran to the forest
for leaves.</p>

<p align="justify">The grass and soil were dry and warm;
and when I returned I thought it had scarcely lost
any of the heat the water had given it.&#160;  I spread
the leaves upon it, and ran for more&#8212;&#173;then
for a third and a fourth freight.</p>

<p align="justify">I could now leave it and go to explore,
in the hope of discovering some shelter.&#160;  I ran
up the stream toward some rocky hills I saw in that
direction, which were not far off.</p>

<p align="justify">When I reached them, I found the river
issuing full grown from a rock at the bottom of one
of them.&#160;  To my fancy it seemed to have run down
a stair inside, an eager cataract, at every landing
wild to get out, but only at the foot finding a door
of escape.</p>

<p align="justify">It did not fill the opening whence
it rushed, and I crept through into a little cave,
where I learned that, instead of hurrying tumultuously
down a stair, it rose quietly from the ground at the
back like the base of a large column, and ran along
one side, nearly filling a deep, rather narrow channel.&#160;
 I considered the place, and saw that, if I could
find a few fallen boughs long enough to lie across
the channel, and large enough to bear a little weight
without bending much, I might, with smaller branches
and plenty of leaves, make upon them a comfortable
couch, which the stream under would keep constantly
warm.&#160;  Then I ran back to see how my charge fared.</p>

<p align="justify">She was lying as I had left her.&#160;
 The heat had not brought her to life, but neither
had it developed anything to check farther hope.&#160;
I got a few boulders out of the channel, and arranged
them at her feet and on both sides of her.</p>

<p align="justify">Running again to the wood, I had not
to search long ere I found some small boughs fit for
my purpose&#8212;&#173;mostly of beech, their dry yellow
leaves yet clinging to them.&#160;  With these I had
soon laid the floor of a bridge-bed over the torrent.&#160;
 I crossed the boughs with smaller branches, interlaced
these with twigs, and buried all deep in leaves and
dry moss.</p>

<p align="justify">When thus at length, after not a few
journeys to the forest, I had completed a warm, dry,
soft couch, I took the body once more, and set out
with it for the cave.&#160;  It was so light that now
and then as I went I almost feared lest, when I laid
it down, I should find it a skeleton after all; and
when at last I did lay it gently on the pathless bridge,
it was a greater relief to part with that fancy than
with the weight.&#160;  Once more I covered the body
with a thick layer of leaves; and trying again to
feed her with a grape, found to my joy that I could
open the mouth a little farther.&#160;  The grape,
indeed, lay in it unheeded, but I hoped some of the
juice might find its way down.</p>

<p align="justify">After an hour or two on the couch,
she was no longer cold.&#160;  The warmth of the brook
had interpenetrated her frame&#8212;&#173;truly it was
but a frame!&#8212;&#173;and she was warm to the touch;&#8212;&#173;not,
probably, with the warmth of life, but with a warmth
which rendered it more possible, if she were alive,
that she might live.&#160;  I had read of one in a
trance lying motionless for weeks!</p>

<p align="justify">In that cave, day after day, night
after night, seven long days and nights, I sat or
lay, now waking now sleeping, but always watching.&#160;
Every morning I went out and bathed in the hot stream,
and every morning felt thereupon as if I had eaten
and drunk&#8212;&#173;which experience gave me courage
to lay her in it also every day.&#160;  Once as I did
so, a shadow of discoloration on her left side gave
me a terrible shock, but the next morning it had vanished,
and I continued the treatment&#8212;&#173; every morning,
after her bath, putting a fresh grape in her mouth.</p>

<p align="justify">I too ate of the grapes and other
berries I found in the forest; but I believed that,
with my daily bath in that river, I could have done
very well without eating at all.</p>

<p align="justify">Every time I slept, I dreamed of finding
a wounded angel, who, unable to fly, remained with
me until at last she loved me and would not leave
me; and every time I woke, it was to see, instead of
an angel-visage with lustrous eyes, the white, motionless,
wasted face upon the couch.&#160;  But Adam himself,
when first he saw her asleep, could not have looked
more anxiously for Eve&#8217;s awaking than I watched
for this woman&#8217;s.&#160;  Adam knew nothing of
himself, perhaps nothing of his need of another self;
I, an alien from my fellows, had learned to love what
I had lost!&#160;  Were this one wasted shred of womanhood
to disappear, I should have nothing in me but a consuming
hunger after life!&#160;  I forgot even the Little Ones:&#160;
things were not amiss with them! here lay what might
wake and be a woman! might actually open eyes, and
look out of them upon me!</p>

<p align="justify">Now first I knew what solitude meant&#8212;&#173;now
that I gazed on one who neither saw nor heard, neither
moved nor spoke.&#160;  I saw now that a man alone
is but a being that may become a man&#8212;&#173;that
he is but a need, and therefore a possibility.&#160;
 To be enough for himself, a being must be an eternal,
self-existent worm!&#160;  So superbly constituted,
so simply complicate is man; he rises from and stands
upon such a pedestal of lower physical organisms and
spiritual structures, that no atmosphere will comfort
or nourish his life, less divine than that offered
by other souls; nowhere but in other lives can he
breathe.&#160;  Only by the reflex of other lives can
he ripen his specialty, develop the idea of himself,
the individuality that distinguishes him from every
other.&#160;  Were all men alike, each would still
have an individuality, secured by his personal consciousness,
but there would be small reason why there should be
more than two or three such; while, for the development
of the differences which make a large and lofty unity
possible, and which alone can make millions into a
church, an endless and measureless influence and reaction
are indispensable.&#160;  A man to be perfect&#8212;&#173;complete,
that is, in having reached the spiritual condition
of persistent and universal growth, which is the mode
wherein he inherits the infinitude of his Father&#8212;&#173;
must have the education of a world of fellow-men.&#160;
 Save for the hope of the dawn of life in the form
beside me, I should have fled for fellowship to the
beasts that grazed and did not speak.&#160;  Better
to go about with them&#8212;&#173;infinitely better&#8212;&#173;than
to live alone!&#160;  But with the faintest prospect
of a woman to my friend, I, poorest of creatures,
was yet a possible man!</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XIX</h1>

<p><b>THE WHITE LEECH</b></p>

<p align="justify">I woke one morning from a profound
sleep, with one of my hands very painful.&#160;  The
back of it was much swollen, and in the centre of
the swelling was a triangular wound, like the bite
of a leech.&#160;  As the day went on, the swelling
subsided, and by the evening the hurt was all but
healed.&#160;  I searched the cave, turning over every
stone of any size, but discovered nothing I could
imagine capable of injuring me.</p>

<p align="justify">Slowly the days passed, and still
the body never moved, never opened its eyes.&#160;
 It could not be dead, for assuredly it manifested
no sign of decay, and the air about it was quite pure.&#160;
 Moreover, I could imagine that the sharpest angles
of the bones had begun to disappear, that the form
was everywhere a little rounder, and the skin had
less of the parchment-look:&#160; if such change was
indeed there, life must be there! the tide which had
ebbed so far toward the infinite, must have begun
again to flow!&#160;  Oh joy to me, if the rising ripples
of life&#8217;s ocean were indeed burying under lovely
shape the bones it had all but forsaken!&#160;  Twenty
times a day I looked for evidence of progress, and
twenty times a day I doubted&#8212;&#173; sometimes
even despaired; but the moment I recalled the mental
picture of her as I found her, hope revived.</p>

<p align="justify">Several weeks had passed thus, when
one night, after lying a long time awake, I rose,
thinking to go out and breathe the cooler air; for,
although from the running of the stream it was always
fresh in the cave, the heat was not seldom a little
oppressive.&#160;  The moon outside was full, the air
within shadowy clear, and naturally I cast a lingering
look on my treasure ere I went.&#160;  &#8220;Bliss
eternal!&#8221; I cried aloud, &#8220;do I see her
eyes?&#8221; Great orbs, dark as if cut from the sphere
of a starless night, and luminous by excess of darkness,
seemed to shine amid the glimmering whiteness of her
face.&#160;  I stole nearer, my heart beating so that
I feared the noise of it startling her.&#160;  I bent
over her.&#160;  Alas, her eyelids were close shut!&#160;
 Hope and Imagination had wrought mutual illusion!
my heart&#8217;s desire would never be!&#160;  I turned
away, threw myself on the floor of the cave, and wept.&#160;
 Then I bethought me that her eyes had been a little
open, and that now the awful chink out of which nothingness
had peered, was gone:&#160; it might be that she had
opened them for a moment, and was again asleep!&#8212;&#173;it
might be she was awake and holding them close!&#160;
In either case, life, less or more, must have shut
them!&#160;  I was comforted, and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p align="justify">That night I was again bitten, and
awoke with a burning thirst.</p>

<p align="justify">In the morning I searched yet more
thoroughly, but again in vain.&#160; The wound was
of the same character, and, as before, was nearly well
by the evening.&#160;  I concluded that some large creature
of the leech kind came occasionally from the hot stream.&#160;
 &#8220;But, if blood be its object,&#8221; I said
to myself, &#8220;so long as I am there, I need hardly
fear for my treasure!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">That same morning, when, having peeled
a grape as usual and taken away the seeds, I put it
in her mouth, her lips made a slight movement of reception,
and I <i>knew</i> she lived!</p>

<p align="justify">My hope was now so much stronger that
I began to think of some attire for her:&#160; she
must be able to rise the moment she wished!&#160;  I
betook myself therefore to the forest, to investigate
what material it might afford, and had hardly begun
to look when fibrous skeletons, like those of the
leaves of the prickly pear, suggested themselves as
fit for the purpose.&#160;  I gathered a stock of them,
laid them to dry in the sun, pulled apart the reticulated
layers, and of these had soon begun to fashion two
loose garments, one to hang from her waist, the other
from her shoulders.&#160;  With the stiletto-point of
an aloe-leaf and various filaments, I sewed together
three thicknesses of the tissue.</p>

<p align="justify">During the week that followed, there
was no farther sign except that she more evidently
took the grapes.&#160;  But indeed all the signs became
surer:&#160; plainly she was growing plumper, and her
skin fairer.&#160; Still she did not open her eyes;
and the horrid fear would at times invade me, that
her growth was of some hideous fungoid nature, the
few grapes being nowise sufficient to account for it.</p>

<p align="justify">Again I was bitten; and now the thing,
whatever it was, began to pay me regular visits at
intervals of three days.&#160;  It now generally bit
me in the neck or the arm, invariably with but one
bite, always while I slept, and never, even when I
slept, in the daytime.&#160;  Hour after hour would
I lie awake on the watch, but never heard it coming,
or saw sign of its approach.&#160;  Neither, I believe,
did I ever feel it bite me.&#160;  At length I became
so hopeless of catching it, that I no longer troubled
myself either to look for it by day, or lie in wait
for it at night.&#160;  I knew from my growing weakness
that I was losing blood at a dangerous rate, but I
cared little for that:&#160; in sight of my eyes death
was yielding to life; a soul was gathering strength
to save me from loneliness; we would go away together,
and I should speedily recover!</p>

<p align="justify">The garments were at length finished,
and, contemplating my handiwork with no small satisfaction,
I proceeded to mat layers of the fibre into sandals.</p>

<p align="justify">One night I woke suddenly, breathless
and faint, and longing after air, and had risen to
crawl from the cave, when a slight rustle in the leaves
of the couch set me listening motionless.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I caught the vile thing,&#8221;
said a feeble voice, in my mother-tongue; &#8220;I
caught it in the very act!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She was alive! she spoke!&#160;  I
dared not yield to my transport lest I should terrify
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What creature?&#8221; I breathed, rather than
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The creature,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;that
was biting you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A great white leech.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How big?&#8221; I pursued, forcing myself to
be calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not far from six feet long, I should think,&#8221;
she answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have saved my life, perhaps!&#8212;&#173;But
how could you touch the horrid thing!&#160;  How brave
of you!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did!&#8221; was all her answer, and I thought
she shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#160;  What could you do with such
a monster?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I threw it in the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it will come again, I fear!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not think I could have
killed it, even had I known how!&#8212;&#173;I heard
you moaning, and got up to see what disturbed you;
saw the frightful thing at your neck, and pulled it
away.&#160;  But I could not hold it, and was hardly
able to throw it from me.&#160;  I only heard it splash
in the water!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We&#8217;ll kill it next time!&#8221;
I said; but with that I turned faint, sought the open
air, but fell.</p>

<p align="justify">When I came to myself the sun was
up.&#160;  The lady stood a little way off, looking,
even in the clumsy attire I had fashioned for her,
at once grand and graceful.&#160;  I <i>had</i> seen
those glorious eyes!&#160;  Through the night they
had shone!&#160;  Dark as the darkness primeval, they
now outshone the day!&#160;  She stood erect as a column,
regarding me.&#160;  Her pale cheek indicated no emotion,
only question.&#160;  I rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must be going!&#8221; I said.&#160;  &#8220;The
white leech&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>I stopped:&#160; a strange smile had flickered over
her beautiful face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find me there?&#8221; she asked, pointing
to the cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I brought you there,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;You brought me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done with my clothes&#8212;&#173;and
my jewels?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had none when I found you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did you not leave me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I hoped you were not dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you have cared?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I was very lonely, and wanted you to
live.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You would have kept me enchanted
for my beauty!&#8221; she said, with proud scorn.</p>

<p>Her words and her look roused my indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no beauty left in you,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, again, did you not let me alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you were of my own kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of <i>your</i> kind?&#8221; she cried, in a tone
of utter contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so, but find I was mistaken!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless you pitied me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never had woman more claim on pity, or less
on any other feeling!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">With an expression of pain, mortification,
and anger unutterable, she turned from me and stood
silent.&#160;  Starless night lay profound in the gulfs
of her eyes:&#160; hate of him who brought it back had
slain their splendour.&#160;  The light of life was
gone from them.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Had you failed to rouse me,
what would you have done?&#8221; she asked suddenly
without moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have buried it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It!&#160; What?&#8212;&#173;You
would have buried <i>this</i>?&#8221; she exclaimed,
flashing round upon me in a white fury, her arms thrown
out, and her eyes darting forks of cold lightning.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nay; that I saw not!&#160; 
That, weary weeks of watching and tending have brought
back to you,&#8221; I answered&#8212;&#173;for with
such a woman I must be plain!&#160;  &#8220;Had I seen
the smallest sign of decay, I would at once have buried
you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Dog of a fool!&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;I was but in a trance&#8212;&#173;Samoil! what
a fate!&#8212;&#173;Go and fetch the she-savage from
whom you borrowed this hideous disguise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made it for you.&#160;  It is hideous, but
I did my best.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew herself up to her tall height.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How long have I been insensible?&#8221;
she demanded.&#160;  &#8220;A woman could not have
made that dress in a day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in twenty days,&#8221; I rejoined, &#8220;hardly
in thirty!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ha!&#160; How long do you pretend
I have lain unconscious?&#8212;&#173;Answer me at once.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot tell how long you
had lain when I found you, but there was nothing left
of you save skin and bone:&#160; that is more than three
months ago.&#8212;&#173;Your hair was beautiful, nothing
else!&#160;  I have done for it what I could.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My poor hair!&#8221; she said,
and brought a great armful of it round from behind
her; &#8220;&#8212;&#173;it will be more than a three-months&#8217;
care to bring <i>you</i> to life again!&#8212;&#173;I
suppose I must thank you, although I cannot say I
am grateful!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is no need, madam:&#160;
I would have done the same for any woman&#8212;&#173;yes,
or for any man either!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How is it my hair is not tangled?&#8221;
she said, fondling it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It always drifted in the current.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8212;&#173;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I could not have brought you
to life but by bathing you in the hot river every
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She gave a shudder of disgust, and
stood for a while with her gaze fixed on the hurrying
water.&#160;  Then she turned to me:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We must understand each other!&#8221;
she said.  &#8220;&#8212;&#173;You have done me the
two worst of wrongs&#8212;&#173;compelled me to live,
and put me to shame:&#160; neither of them can I pardon!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She raised her left hand, and flung
it out as if repelling me.&#160; Something ice-cold
struck me on the forehead.&#160;  When I came to myself,
I was on the ground, wet and shivering.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XX</h1>

<p>GONE!&#8212;&#173;<i>But</i> <i>how</i>?</p>

<p align="justify">I rose, and looked around me, dazed
at heart.&#160;  For a moment I could not see her:&#160;
she was gone, and loneliness had returned like the
cloud after the rain!&#160;  She whom I brought back
from the brink of the grave, had fled from me, and
left me with desolation!&#160;  I dared not one moment
remain thus hideously alone.&#160;  Had I indeed done
her a wrong?&#160;  I must devote my life to sharing
the burden I had compelled her to resume!</p>

<p align="justify">I descried her walking swiftly over
the grass, away from the river, took one plunge for
a farewell restorative, and set out to follow her.&#160;
 The last visit of the white leech, and the blow of
the woman, had enfeebled me, but already my strength
was reviving, and I kept her in sight without difficulty.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Is this, then, the end?&#8221;
I said as I went, and my heart brooded a sad song.&#160;
 Her angry, hating eyes haunted me.&#160;  I could understand
her resentment at my having forced life upon her, but
how had I further injured her?&#160;  Why should she
loathe me?&#160;  Could modesty itself be indignant
with true service?&#160;  How should the proudest woman,
conscious of my every action, cherish against me the
least sense of disgracing wrong?&#160;  How reverently
had I not touched her!&#160;  As a father his motherless
child, I had borne and tended her!&#160;  Had all my
labour, all my despairing hope gone to redeem only
ingratitude?&#160;  &#8220;No,&#8221; I answered myself;
&#8220;beauty must have a heart!&#160;  However profoundly
hidden, it must be there!&#160;  The deeper buried,
the stronger and truer will it wake at last in its
beautiful grave!&#160;  To rouse that heart were a
better gift to her than the happiest life!&#160;  It
would be to give her a nobler, a higher life!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She was ascending a gentle slope before
me, walking straight and steady as one that knew whither,
when I became aware that she was increasing the distance
between us.&#160;  I summoned my strength, and it came
in full tide.&#160;  My veins filled with fresh life!&#160;
 My body seemed to become ethereal, and, following
like an easy wind, I rapidly overtook her.</p>

<p align="justify">Not once had she looked behind.&#160;
 Swiftly she moved, like a Greek goddess to rescue,
but without haste.&#160;  I was within three yards of
her, when she turned sharply, yet with grace unbroken,
and stood.&#160; Fatigue or heat she showed none.&#160;
 Her paleness was not a pallor, but a pure whiteness;
her breathing was slow and deep.&#160;  Her eyes seemed
to fill the heavens, and give light to the world.&#160;
 It was nearly noon, but the sense was upon me as
of a great night in which an invisible dew makes the
stars look large.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why do you follow me?&#8221;
she asked, quietly but rather sternly, as if she had
never before seen me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have lived so long,&#8221;
I answered, &#8220;on the mere hope of your eyes,
that I must want to see them again!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You <i>will</i> not be spared!&#8221;
she said coldly.&#160;  &#8220;I command you to stop
where you stand.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not until I see you in a place
of safety will I leave you,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then take the consequences,&#8221;
she said, and resumed her swift-gliding walk.</p>

<p align="justify">But as she turned she cast on me a
glance, and I stood as if run through with a spear.&#160;
 Her scorn had failed:&#160; she would kill me with
her beauty!</p>

<p align="justify">Despair restored my volition; the
spell broke; I ran, and overtook her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have pity upon me!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">She gave no heed.&#160;  I followed
her like a child whose mother pretends to abandon
him.&#160;  &#8220;I will be your slave!&#8221; I said,
and laid my hand on her arm.</p>

<p align="justify">She turned as if a serpent had bit
her.&#160;  I cowered before the blaze of her eyes,
but could not avert my own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity me,&#8221; I cried again.</p>

<p>She resumed her walking.</p>

<p align="justify">The whole day I followed her.&#160;
 The sun climbed the sky, seemed to pause on its summit,
went down the other side.&#160;  Not a moment did she
pause, not a moment did I cease to follow.&#160;  She
never turned her head, never relaxed her pace.</p>

<p align="justify">The sun went below, and the night
came up.&#160;  I kept close to her:&#160; if I lost
sight of her for a moment, it would be for ever!</p>

<p align="justify">All day long we had been walking over
thick soft grass:&#160; abruptly she stopped, and threw
herself upon it.&#160;  There was yet light enough
to show that she was utterly weary.&#160;  I stood behind
her, and gazed down on her for a moment.</p>

<p align="justify">Did I love her?&#160;  I knew she was
not good!&#160;  Did I hate her?&#160;  I could not
leave her!&#160;  I knelt beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Begone!&#160;  Do not dare touch me,&#8221;
she cried.</p>

<p>Her arms lay on the grass by her sides as if paralyzed.</p>

<p align="justify">Suddenly they closed about my neck,
rigid as those of the torture-maiden.&#160;  She drew
down my face to hers, and her lips clung to my cheek.&#160;
 A sting of pain shot somewhere through me, and pulsed.&#160;
I could not stir a hair&#8217;s breadth.&#160;  Gradually
the pain ceased.&#160;  A slumberous weariness, a dreamy
pleasure stole over me, and then I knew nothing.</p>

<p align="justify">All at once I came to myself.&#160;
 The moon was a little way above the horizon, but
spread no radiance; she was but a bright thing set
in blackness.&#160;  My cheek smarted; I put my hand
to it, and found a wet spot.&#160;  My neck ached:&#160;
there again was a wet spot!&#160;  I sighed heavily,
and felt very tired.&#160;  I turned my eyes listlessly
around me&#8212;&#173;and saw what had become of the
light of the moon:&#160; it was gathered about the
lady! she stood in a shimmering nimbus!&#160;  I rose
and staggered toward her.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Down!&#8221; she cried imperiously,
as to a rebellious dog.&#160;  &#8220;Follow me a step
if you dare!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; I murmured, with an agonised
effort.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Set foot within the gates of
my city, and my people will stone you:&#160; they do
not love beggars!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I was deaf to her words.&#160;  Weak
as water, and half awake, I did not know that I moved,
but the distance grew less between us.&#160;  She took
one step back, raised her left arm, and with the clenched
hand seemed to strike me on the forehead.&#160;  I
received as it were a blow from an iron hammer, and
fell.</p>

<p align="justify">I sprang to my feet, cold and wet,
but clear-headed and strong.&#160;  Had the blow revived
me? it had left neither wound nor pain!&#8212;&#173;But
how came I wet?&#8212;&#173;I could not have lain long,
for the moon was no higher!</p>

<p align="justify">The lady stood some yards away, her
back toward me.&#160;  She was doing something, I could
not distinguish what.&#160;  Then by her sudden gleam
I knew she had thrown off her garments, and stood white
in the dazed moon.&#160;  One moment she stood&#8212;&#173;and
fell forward.</p>

<p align="justify">A streak of white shot away in a swift-drawn
line.&#160;  The same instant the moon recovered herself,
shining out with a full flash, and I saw that the
streak was a long-bodied thing, rushing in great,
low-curved bounds over the grass.&#160;  Dark spots
seemed to run like a stream adown its back, as if
it had been fleeting along under the edge of a wood,
and catching the shadows of the leaves.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;God of mercy!&#8221; I cried,
&#8220;is the terrible creature speeding to the night-infolded
city?&#8221; and I seemed to hear from afar the sudden
burst and spread of outcrying terror, as the pale savage
bounded from house to house, rending and slaying.</p>

<p align="justify">While I gazed after it fear-stricken,
past me from behind, like a swift, all but noiseless
arrow, shot a second large creature, pure white.&#160;
 Its path was straight for the spot where the lady
had fallen, and, as I thought, lay.&#160;  My tongue
clave to the roof of my mouth.&#160; I sprang forward
pursuing the beast.&#160;  But in a moment the spot
I made for was far behind it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was well,&#8221; I thought,
&#8220;that I could not cry out:&#160; if she had risen,
the monster would have been upon her!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But when I reached the place, no lady
was there; only the garments she had dropped lay dusk
in the moonlight.</p>

<p align="justify">I stood staring after the second beast.&#160;
 It tore over the ground with yet greater swiftness
than the former&#8212;&#173;in long, level, skimming
leaps, the very embodiment of wasteless speed.&#160;
 It followed the line the other had taken, and I watched
it grow smaller and smaller, until it disappeared
in the uncertain distance.</p>

<p align="justify">But where was the lady?&#160;  Had
the first beast surprised her, creeping upon her noiselessly?&#160;
 I had heard no shriek! and there had not been time
to devour her!&#160;  Could it have caught her up as
it ran, and borne her away to its den?&#160;  So laden
it could not have run so fast! and I should have seen
that it carried something!</p>

<p align="justify">Horrible doubts began to wake in me.&#160;
 After a thorough but fruitless search, I set out
in the track of the two animals.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXI</h1>

<p><b>THE FUGITIVE MOTHER</b></p>

<p align="justify">As I hastened along, a cloud came
over the moon, and from the gray dark suddenly emerged
a white figure, clasping a child to her bosom, and
stooping as she ran.&#160;  She was on a line parallel
with my own, but did not perceive me as she hurried
along, terror and anxiety in every movement of her
driven speed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She is chased!&#8221; I said
to myself.&#160;  &#8220;Some prowler of this terrible
night is after her!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">To follow would have added to her
fright:&#160; I stepped into her track to stop her
pursuer.</p>

<p align="justify">As I stood for a moment looking after
her through the dusk, behind me came a swift, soft-footed
rush, and ere I could turn, something sprang over
my head, struck me sharply on the forehead, and knocked
me down.&#160;  I was up in an instant, but all I saw
of my assailant was a vanishing whiteness.&#160;  I
ran after the beast, with the blood trickling from
my forehead; but had run only a few steps, when a shriek
of despair tore the quivering night.&#160;  I ran the
faster, though I could not but fear it must already
be too late.</p>

<p align="justify">In a minute or two I spied a low white
shape approaching me through the vapour-dusted moonlight.&#160;
 It must be another beast, I thought at first, for
it came slowly, almost crawling, with strange, floundering
leaps, as of a creature in agony!&#160;  I drew aside
from its path, and waited.&#160;  As it neared me,
I saw it was going on three legs, carrying its left
fore-paw high from the ground.&#160;  It had many dark,
oval spots on a shining white skin, and was attended
by a low rushing sound, as of water falling upon grass.&#160;
 As it went by me, I saw something streaming from
the lifted paw.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is blood!&#8221; I said
to myself, &#8220;some readier champion than I has
wounded the beast!&#8221;  But, strange to tell, such
a pity seized me at sight of the suffering creature,
that, though an axe had been in my hand I could not
have struck at it.&#160;  In a broken succession of
hobbling leaps it went out of sight, its blood, as
it seemed, still issuing in a small torrent, which
kept flowing back softly through the grass beside
me.&#160;  &#8220;If it go on bleeding like that,&#8221;
I thought, &#8220;it will soon be hurtless!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I went on, for I might yet be useful
to the woman, and hoped also to see her deliverer.</p>

<p align="justify">I descried her a little way off, seated
on the grass, with her child in her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I do anything for you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">At the sound of my voice she started
violently, and would have risen.&#160; I threw myself
on the ground.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You need not be frightened,&#8221;
I said.&#160;  &#8220;I was following the beast when
happily you found a nearer protector!&#160;  It passed
me now with its foot bleeding so much that by this
time it must be all but dead!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is little hope of that!&#8221;
she answered, trembling.&#160;  &#8220;Do you not know
whose beast she is?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Now I had certain strange suspicions,
but I answered that I knew nothing of the brute, and
asked what had become of her champion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What champion?&#8221; she rejoined.&#160;  &#8220;I
have seen no one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how came the monster to grief?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I pounded her foot with a stone&#8212;&#173;as
hard as I could strike.&#160;  Did you not hear her
cry?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, you are a brave woman!&#8221;
I answered.&#160;  &#8220;I thought it was you gave
the cry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the leopardess.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I never heard such a sound
from the throat of an animal! it was like the scream
of a woman in torture!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My voice was gone; I could
not have shrieked to save my baby!&#160;  When I saw
the horrid mouth at my darling&#8217;s little white
neck, I caught up a stone and mashed her lame foot.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tell me about the creature,&#8221;
I said; &#8220;I am a stranger in these parts.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You will soon know about her
if you are going to Bulika!&#8221; she answered.&#160;
 &#8220;Now, I must never go back there!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, I am going to Bulika,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;&#8212;&#173;to see the princess.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Have a care; you had better
not go!&#8212;&#173;But perhaps you are&#8212;!&#160;
 The princess is a very good, kind woman!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I heard a little movement.&#160;  Clouds
had by this time gathered so thick over the moon that
I could scarcely see my companion:&#160; I feared she
was rising to run from me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are in no danger of any
sort from me,&#8221; I said.&#160;  &#8220;What oath
would you like me to take?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I know by your speech that
you are not of the people of Bulika,&#8221; she replied;
&#8220;I will trust you!&#8212;&#173;I am not of them,
either, else I should not be able:&#160; they never
trust any one&#8212;&#173;If only I could see you!&#160;
 But I like your voice!&#8212;&#173;There, my darling
is asleep!&#160;  The foul beast has not hurt her!&#8212;&#173;Yes:&#160;
it was my baby she was after!&#8221; she went on,
caressing the child.&#160;  &#8220;And then she would
have torn her mother to pieces for carrying her off!&#8212;&#173;Some
say the princess has two white leopardesses,&#8221;
she continued:&#160; &#8220;I know only one&#8212;&#173;with
spots.&#160; Everybody knows <i>her</i>!&#160;  If the
princess hear of a baby, she sends her immediately
to suck its blood, and then it either dies or grows
up an idiot.&#160;  I would have gone away with my
baby, but the princess was from home, and I thought
I might wait until I was a little stronger.&#160; But
she must have taken the beast with her, and been on
her way home when I left, and come across my track.&#160;
 I heard the SNIFF-SNUFF of the leopardess behind
me, and ran;&#8212;&#173;oh, how I ran!&#8212;&#173;But
my darling will not die!&#160;  There is no mark on
her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you taking her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where no one ever tells!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is the princess so cruel?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is an old prophecy that
a child will be the death of her.&#160; That is why
she will listen to no offer of marriage, they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will become of her country if she
kill all the babies?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She does not care about her
country.&#160;  She sends witches around to teach the
women spells that keep babies away, and give them horrible
things to eat.&#160;  Some say she is in league with
the Shadows to put an end to the race.&#160;  At night
we hear the questing beast, and lie awake and shiver.&#160;
 She can tell at once the house where a baby is coming,
and lies down at the door, watching to get in.&#160;
 There are words that have power to shoo her away,
only they do not always work&#8212;&#173;But here I
sit talking, and the beast may by this time have got
home, and her mistress be sending the other after us!&#8221;</p>

<p>As thus she ended, she rose in haste.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not think she will ever
get home.&#8212;&#173;Let me carry the baby for you!&#8221;
I said, as I rose also.</p>

<p align="justify">She returned me no answer, and when
I would have taken it, only clasped it the closer.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot think,&#8221; I said,
walking by her side, &#8220;how the brute could be
bleeding so much!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Take my advice, and don&#8217;t
go near the palace,&#8221; she answered.&#160;  &#8220;There
are sounds in it at night as if the dead were trying
to shriek, but could not open their mouths!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She bade me an abrupt farewell.&#160;
 Plainly she did not want more of my company; so I
stood still, and heard her footsteps die away on the
grass.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXII</h1>

<p><b>BULIKA</b></p>

<p align="justify">I had lost all notion of my position,
and was walking about in pure, helpless impatience,
when suddenly I found myself in the path of the leopardess,
wading in the blood from her paw.&#160;  It ran against
my ankles with the force of a small brook, and I got
out of it the more quickly because of an unshaped
suspicion in my mind as to whose blood it might be.&#160;
 But I kept close to the sound of it, walking up the
side of the stream, for it would guide me in the direction
of Bulika.</p>

<p align="justify">I soon began to reflect, however,
that no leopardess, no elephant, no hugest animal
that in our world preceded man, could keep such a
torrent flowing, except every artery in its body were
open, and its huge system went on filling its vessels
from fields and lakes and forests as fast as they
emptied themselves:&#160; it could not be blood!&#160;
I dipped a finger in it, and at once satisfied myself
that it was not.&#160;  In truth, however it might
have come there, it was a softly murmuring rivulet
of water that ran, without channel, over the grass!&#160;
But sweet as was its song, I dared not drink of it;
I kept walking on, hoping after the light, and listening
to the familiar sound so long unheard&#8212;&#173;for
that of the hot stream was very different.&#160;  The
mere wetting of my feet in it, however, had so refreshed
me, that I went on without fatigue till the darkness
began to grow thinner, and I knew the sun was drawing
nigh.&#160;  A few minutes more, and I could discern,
against the pale aurora, the wall-towers of a city&#8212;&#173;seemingly
old as time itself.&#160;  Then I looked down to get
a sight of the brook.</p>

<p align="justify">It was gone.&#160;  I had indeed for
a long time noted its sound growing fainter, but at
last had ceased to attend to it.&#160;  I looked back:&#160;
the grass in its course lay bent as it had flowed,
and here and there glimmered a small pool.&#160;  Toward
the city, there was no trace of it.&#160;  Near where
I stood, the flow of its fountain must at least have
paused!</p>

<p align="justify">Around the city were gardens, growing
many sorts of vegetables, hardly one of which I recognised.&#160;
 I saw no water, no flowers, no sign of animals.&#160;
 The gardens came very near the walls, but were separated
from them by huge heaps of gravel and refuse thrown
from the battlements.</p>

<p align="justify">I went up to the nearest gate, and
found it but half-closed, nowise secured, and without
guard or sentinel.&#160;  To judge by its hinges, it
could not be farther opened or shut closer.&#160;  Passing
through, I looked down a long ancient street.&#160;
 It was utterly silent, and with scarce an indication
in it of life present.&#160;  Had I come upon a dead
city?&#160;  I turned and went out again, toiled a long
way over the dust-heaps, and crossed several roads,
each leading up to a gate:&#160; I would not re-enter
until some of the inhabitants should be stirring.</p>

<p align="justify">What was I there for? what did I expect
or hope to find? what did I mean to do?</p>

<p align="justify">I must see, if but once more, the
woman I had brought to life!&#160;  I did not desire
her society:&#160; she had waked in me frightful suspicions;
and friendship, not to say love, was wildly impossible
between us!&#160;  But her presence had had a strange
influence upon me, and in her presence I must resist,
and at the same time analyse that influence!&#160; 
The seemingly inscrutable in her I would fain penetrate:&#160;
to understand something of her mode of being would
be to look into marvels such as imagination could
never have suggested!&#160;  In this I was too daring:&#160;
a man must not, for knowledge, of his own will encounter
temptation!&#160; On the other hand, I had reinstated
an evil force about to perish, and was, to the extent
of my opposing faculty, accountable for what mischief
might ensue!&#160;  I had learned that she was the enemy
of children:&#160; the Little Ones might be in her
danger!&#160;  It was in the hope of finding out something
of their history that I had left them; on that I had
received a little light:&#160; I must have more; I must
learn how to protect them!</p>

<p align="justify">Hearing at length a little stir in
the place, I walked through the next gate, and thence
along a narrow street of tall houses to a little square,
where I sat down on the base of a pillar with a hideous
bat-like creature atop.&#160;  Ere long, several of
the inhabitants came sauntering past.&#160;  I spoke
to one:&#160; he gave me a rude stare and ruder word,
and went on.</p>

<p align="justify">I got up and went through one narrow
street after another, gradually filling with idlers,
and was not surprised to see no children.&#160;  By
and by, near one of the gates, I encountered a group
of young men who reminded me not a little of the bad
giants.&#160;  They came about me staring, and presently
began to push and hustle me, then to throw things
at me.&#160;  I bore it as well as I could, wishing
not to provoke enmity where wanted to remain for a
while.&#160;  Oftener than once or twice I appealed
to passers-by whom I fancied more benevolent-looking,
but none would halt a moment to listen to me.&#160;
 I looked poor, and that was enough:&#160; to the citizens
of Bulika, as to house-dogs, poverty was an offence!&#160;
 Deformity and sickness were taxed; and no legislation
of their princess was more heartily approved of than
what tended to make poverty subserve wealth.</p>

<p align="justify">I took to my heels at last, and no
one followed me beyond the gate.&#160; A lumbering
fellow, however, who sat by it eating a hunch of bread,
picked up a stone to throw after me, and happily, in
his stupid eagerness, threw, not the stone but the
bread.&#160;  I took it, and he did not dare follow
to reclaim it:&#160; beyond the walls they were cowards
every one.&#160;  I went off a few hundred yards, threw
myself down, ate the bread, fell asleep, and slept
soundly in the grass, where the hot sunlight renewed
my strength.</p>

<p align="justify">It was night when I woke.&#160;  The
moon looked down on me in friendly fashion, seeming
to claim with me old acquaintance.&#160;  She was very
bright, and the same moon, I thought, that saw me through
the terrors of my first night in that strange world.&#160;
 A cold wind blew from the gate, bringing with it
an evil odour; but it did not chill me, for the sun
had plenished me with warmth.&#160;  I crept again into
the city.&#160; There I found the few that were still
in the open air crouched in corners to escape the
shivering blast.</p>

<p align="justify">I was walking slowly through the long
narrow street, when, just before me, a huge white
thing bounded across it, with a single flash in the
moonlight, and disappeared.&#160;  I turned down the
next opening, eager to get sight of it again.</p>

<p align="justify">It was a narrow lane, almost too narrow
to pass through, but it led me into a wider street.&#160;
 The moment I entered the latter, I saw on the opposite
side, in the shadow, the creature I had followed,
itself following like a dog what I took for a man.&#160;
 Over his shoulder, every other moment, he glanced
at the animal behind him, but neither spoke to it,
nor attempted to drive it away.&#160;  At a place where
he had to cross a patch of moonlight, I saw that he
cast no shadow, and was himself but a flat superficial
shadow, of two dimensions.&#160; He was, nevertheless,
an opaque shadow, for he not merely darkened any object
on the other side of him, but rendered it, in fact,
invisible.&#160;  In the shadow he was blacker than
the shadow; in the moonlight he looked like one who
had drawn his shadow up about him, for not a suspicion
of it moved beside or under him; while the gleaming
animal, which followed so close at his heels as to
seem the white shadow of his blackness, and which
I now saw to be a leopardess, drew her own gliding
shadow black over the ground by her side.&#160;  When
they passed together from the shadow into the moonlight,
the Shadow deepened in blackness, the animal flashed
into radiance.&#160;  I was at the moment walking abreast
of them on the opposite side, my bare feet sounding
on the flat stones:&#160; the leopardess never turned
head or twitched ear; the shadow seemed once to look
at me, for I lost his profile, and saw for a second
only a sharp upright line.&#160;  That instant the wind
found me and blew through me:&#160; I shuddered from
head to foot, and my heart went from wall to wall
of my bosom, like a pebble in a child&#8217;s rattle.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXIII</h1>

<p><b>A WOMAN OF BULIKA</b></p>

<p align="justify">I turned aside into an alley, and
sought shelter in a small archway.&#160; In the mouth
of it I stopped, and looked out at the moonlight which
filled the alley.&#160;  The same instant a woman came
gliding in after me, turned, trembling, and looked
out also.&#160;  A few seconds passed; then a huge
leopard, its white skin dappled with many blots, darted
across the archway.&#160;  The woman pressed close to
me, and my heart filled with pity.&#160;  I put my
arm round her.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If the brute come here, I will
lay hold of it,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and you must
run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen it before?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Several times,&#8221; she answered,
still trembling.&#160;  &#8220;She is a pet of the
princess&#8217;s.&#160;  You are a stranger, or you
would know her!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am a stranger,&#8221; I answered.&#160;
 &#8220;But is she, then, allowed to run loose?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She is kept in a cage, her
mouth muzzled, and her feet in gloves of crocodile
leather.&#160;  Chained she is too; but she gets out
often, and sucks the blood of any child she can lay
hold of.&#160;  Happily there are not many mothers
in Bulika!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here she burst into tears.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I wish I were at home!&#8221;
she sobbed.&#160;  &#8220;The princess returned only
last night, and there is the leopardess out already!&#160;
 How am I to get into the house?&#160;  It is me she
is after, I know!&#160;  She will be lying at my own
door, watching for me!&#8212;&#173;But I am a fool to
talk to a stranger!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;All strangers are not bad!&#8221;
I said.&#160;  &#8220;The beast shall not touch you
till she has done with me, and by that time you will
be in.&#160;  You are happy to have a house to go to!&#160;
 What a terrible wind it is!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Take me home safe, and I will
give you shelter from it,&#8221; she rejoined.&#160;
 &#8220;But we must wait a little!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I asked her many questions.&#160; 
She told me the people never did anything except dig
for precious stones in their cellars.&#160;  They were
rich, and had everything made for them in other towns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because it is a disgrace to
work,&#8221; she answered.&#160;  &#8220;Everybody in
Bulika knows that!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I asked how they were rich if none
of them earned money.&#160;  She replied that their
ancestors had saved for them, and they never spent.&#160;
 When they wanted money they sold a few of their gems.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there must be some poor!&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I suppose there must be, but
we never think of such people.&#160;  When one goes
poor, we forget him.&#160;  That is how we keep rich.&#160;
 We mean to be rich always.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But when you have dug up all
your precious stones and sold them, you will have
to spend your money, and one day you will have none
left!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We have so many, and there
are so many still in the ground, that that day will
never come,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Suppose a strange people were
to fall upon you, and take everything you have!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No strange people will dare;
they are all horribly afraid of our princess.&#160;
 She it is who keeps us safe and free and rich!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Every now and then as she spoke, she
would stop and look behind her.</p>

<p align="justify">I asked why her people had such a
hatred of strangers.&#160;  She answered that the presence
of a stranger defiled the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because we are more ancient
and noble than any other nation.&#8212;&#173; Therefore,&#8221;
she added, &#8220;we always turn strangers out before
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How, then, can you take me into your house?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make an exception of you,&#8221; she
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no place in the city for the taking
in of strangers?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Such a place would be pulled
down, and its owner burned.&#160;  How is purity to
be preserved except by keeping low people at a proper
distance?&#160;  Dignity is such a delicate thing!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She told me that their princess had
reigned for thousands of years; that she had power
over the air and the water as well as the earth&#8212;&#173;
and, she believed, over the fire too; that she could
do what she pleased, and was answerable to nobody.</p>

<p align="justify">When at length she was willing to
risk the attempt, we took our way through lanes and
narrow passages, and reached her door without having
met a single live creature.&#160;  It was in a wider
street, between two tall houses, at the top of a narrow,
steep stair, up which she climbed slowly, and I followed.&#160;
 Ere we reached the top, however, she seemed to take
fright, and darted up the rest of the steps:&#160; I
arrived just in time to have the door closed in my
face, and stood confounded on the landing, where was
about length enough, between the opposite doors of
the two houses, for a man to lie down.</p>

<p align="justify">Weary, and not scrupling to defile
Bulika with my presence, I took advantage of the shelter,
poor as it was.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXIV</h1>

<p><b>THE WHITE LEOPARDESS</b></p>

<p align="justify">At the foot of the stair lay the moonlit
street, and I could hear the unwholesome, inhospitable
wind blowing about below.&#160;  But not a breath of
it entered my retreat, and I was composing myself to
rest, when suddenly my eyes opened, and there was
the head of the shining creature I had seen following
the Shadow, just rising above the uppermost step!&#160;
 The moment she caught sight of my eyes, she stopped
and began to retire, tail foremost.&#160;  I sprang
up; whereupon, having no room to turn, she threw herself
backward, head over tail, scrambled to her feet, and
in a moment was down the stair and gone.&#160;  I followed
her to the bottom, and looked all up and down the street.&#160;
 Not seeing her, I went back to my hard couch.</p>

<p align="justify">There were, then, two evil creatures
prowling about the city, one with, and one without
spots!&#160;  I was not inclined to risk much for man
or woman in Bulika, but the life of a child might well
be worth such a poor one as mine, and I resolved to
keep watch at that door the rest of the night.</p>

<p align="justify">Presently I heard the latch move,
slow, slow:&#160; I looked up, and seeing the door
half-open, rose and slid softly in.&#160;  Behind it
stood, not the woman I had befriended, but the muffled
woman of the desert.&#160;  Without a word she led
me a few steps to an empty stone-paved chamber, and
pointed to a rug on the floor.&#160;  I wrapped myself
in it, and once more lay down.&#160;  She shut the door
of the room, and I heard the outer door open and close
again.&#160;  There was no light save what came from
the moonlit air.</p>

<p align="justify">As I lay sleepless, I began to hear
a stifled moaning.&#160;  It went on for a good while,
and then came the cry of a child, followed by a terrible
shriek.&#160;  I sprang up and darted into the passage:&#160;
from another door in it came the white leopardess
with a new-born baby in her mouth, carrying it like
a cub of her own.&#160;  I threw myself upon her, and
compelled her to drop the infant, which fell on the
stone slabs with a piteous wail.</p>

<p align="justify">At the cry appeared the muffled woman.&#160;
 She stepped over us, the beast and myself, where
we lay struggling in the narrow passage, took up the
child, and carried it away.&#160;  Returning, she lifted
me off the animal, opened the door, and pushed me
gently out.&#160;  At my heels followed the leopardess.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She too has failed me!&#8221;
thought I; &#8220;&#8212;&#173;given me up to the beast
to be settled with at her leisure!&#160;  But we shall
have a tussle for it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I ran down the stair, fearing she
would spring on my back, but she followed me quietly.&#160;
 At the foot I turned to lay hold of her, but she
sprang over my head; and when again I turned to face
her, she was crouching at my feet!&#160;  I stooped
and stroked her lovely white skin; she responded by
licking my bare feet with her hard dry tongue.&#160;
Then I patted and fondled her, a well of tenderness
overflowing in my heart:&#160; she might be treacherous
too, but if I turned from every show of love lest
it should be feigned, how was I ever to find the real
love which must be somewhere in every world?</p>

<p>I stood up; she rose, and stood beside me.</p>

<p align="justify">A bulky object fell with a heavy squelch
in the middle of the street, a few yards from us.&#160;
 I ran to it, and found a pulpy mass, with just form
enough left to show it the body of a woman.&#160;  It
must have been thrown from some neighbouring window!&#160;
 I looked around me:&#160; the Shadow was walking along
the other side of the way, with the white leopardess
again at his heel!</p>

<p align="justify">I followed and gained upon them, urging
in my heart for the leopardess that probably she was
not a free agent.&#160;  When I got near them, however,
she turned and flew at me with such a hideous snarl,
that instinctively I drew back:&#160; instantly she
resumed her place behind the Shadow.&#160;  Again I
drew near; again she flew at me, her eyes flaming
like live emeralds.&#160;  Once more I made the experiment:&#160;
she snapped at me like a dog, and bit me.&#160;  My
heart gave way, and I uttered a cry; whereupon the
creature looked round with a glance that plainly meant&#8212;&#173;&#8220;Why
<i>would</i> you make me do it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I turned away angry with myself:&#160;
I had been losing my time ever since I entered the
place! night as it was I would go straight to the
palace!&#160;  From the square I had seen it&#8212;&#173;high
above the heart of the city, compassed with many defences,
more a fortress than a palace!</p>

<p align="justify">But I found its fortifications, like
those of the city, much neglected, and partly ruinous.&#160;
 For centuries, clearly, they had been of no account!&#160;
 It had great and strong gates, with something like
a drawbridge to them over a rocky chasm; but they stood
open, and it was hard to believe that water had ever
occupied the hollow before them.&#160;  All was so
still that sleep seemed to interpenetrate the structure,
causing the very moonlight to look discordantly awake.&#160;
I must either enter like a thief, or break a silence
that rendered frightful the mere thought of a sound!</p>

<p align="justify">Like an outcast dog I was walking
about the walls, when I came to a little recess with
a stone bench:&#160; I took refuge in it from the wind,
lay down, and in spite of the cold fell fast asleep.</p>

<p align="justify">I was wakened by something leaping
upon me, and licking my face with the rough tongue
of a feline animal.&#160;  &#8220;It is the white leopardess!&#8221;
I thought.&#160;  &#8220;She is come to suck my blood!&#8212;&#173;and
why should she not have it?&#8212;&#173;it would cost
me more to defend than to yield it!&#8221;  So I lay
still, expecting a shoot of pain.&#160;  But the pang
did not arrive; a pleasant warmth instead began to
diffuse itself through me.&#160; Stretched at my back,
she lay as close to me as she could lie, the heat
of her body slowly penetrating mine, and her breath,
which had nothing of the wild beast in it, swathing
my head and face in a genial atmosphere.&#160;  A full
conviction that her intention toward me was good,
gained possession of me.&#160;  I turned like a sleepy
boy, threw my arm over her, and sank into profound
unconsciousness.</p>

<p align="justify">When I began to come to myself, I
fancied I lay warm and soft in my own bed.&#160;  &#8220;Is
it possible I am at home?&#8221; I thought.&#160;  The
well-known scents of the garden seemed to come crowding
in.&#160;  I rubbed my eyes, and looked out:&#160; I
lay on a bare stone, in the heart of a hateful city!</p>

<p align="justify">I sprang from the bench.&#160;  Had
I indeed had a leopardess for my bedfellow, or had
I but dreamed it?&#160;  She had but just left me, for
the warmth of her body was with me yet!</p>

<p align="justify">I left the recess with a new hope,
as strong as it was shapeless.&#160; One thing only
was clear to me:&#160; I must find the princess!&#160;
 Surely I had some power with her, if not over her!&#160;
 Had I not saved her life, and had she not prolonged
it at the expense of my vitality?&#160; The reflection
gave me courage to encounter her, be she what she
might.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXV</h1>

<p><b>THE PRINCESS</b></p>

<p align="justify">Making a circuit of the castle, I
came again to the open gates, crossed the ravine-like
moat, and found myself in a paved court, planted at
regular intervals with towering trees like poplars.&#160;
 In the centre was one taller than the rest, whose
branches, near the top, spread a little and gave it
some resemblance to a palm.&#160;  Between their great
stems I got glimpses of the palace, which was of a
style strange to me, but suggested Indian origin.&#160;
 It was long and low, with lofty towers at the corners,
and one huge dome in the middle, rising from the roof
to half the height of the towers.&#160;  The main entrance
was in the centre of the front&#8212;&#173;a low arch
that seemed half an ellipse.&#160;  No one was visible,
the doors stood wide open, and I went unchallenged
into a large hall, in the form of a longish ellipse.&#160;
 Toward one side stood a cage, in which couched, its
head on its paws, a huge leopardess, chained by a
steel collar, with its mouth muzzled and its paws
muffled.&#160;  It was white with dark oval spots,
and lay staring out of wide-open eyes, with canoe-shaped
pupils, and great green irids.&#160;  It appeared to
watch me, but not an eyeball, not a foot, not a whisker
moved, and its tail stretched out behind it rigid
as an iron bar.&#160;  I could not tell whether it
was a live thing or not.</p>

<p align="justify">&#62;From this vestibule two low passages
led; I took one of them, and found it branch into
many, all narrow and irregular.&#160;  At a spot where
was scarce room for two to pass, a page ran against
me.&#160;  He started back in terror, but having scanned
me, gathered impudence, puffed himself out, and asked
my business.</p>

<p>&#8220;To see the princess,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A likely thing!&#8221; he returned.&#160;
 &#8220;I have not seen her highness this morning
myself!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I caught him by the back of the neck,
shook him, and said, &#8220;Take me to her at once,
or I will drag you with me till I find her.&#160;  She
shall know how her servants receive her visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He gave a look at me, and began to
pull like a blind man&#8217;s dog, leading me thus
to a large kitchen, where were many servants, feebly
busy, and hardly awake.&#160;  I expected them to fall
upon me and drive me out, but they stared instead,
with wide eyes&#8212;&#173;not at me, but at something
behind me, and grew more ghastly as they stared.&#160;
 I turned my head, and saw the white leopardess, regarding
them in a way that might have feared stouter hearts.</p>

<p align="justify">Presently, however, one of them, seeing,
I suppose, that attack was not imminent, began to
recover himself; I turned to him, and let the boy
go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me to the princess,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has not yet left her room, your lordship,&#8221;
he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her know that I am here, waiting audience
of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will your lordship please to give me your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell her that one who knows the white leech
desires to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will kill me if I take such a message:&#160;
I must not.&#160;  I dare not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You refuse?&#8221;</p>

<p>He cast a glance at my attendant, and went.</p>

<p align="justify">The others continued staring&#8212;&#173;too
much afraid of her to take their eyes off her.&#160;
 I turned to the graceful creature, where she stood,
her muzzle dropped to my heel, white as milk, a warm
splendour in the gloomy place, and stooped and patted
her.&#160;  She looked up at me; the mere movement
of her head was enough to scatter them in all directions.&#160;
 She rose on her hind legs, and put her paws on my
shoulders; I threw my arms round her.&#160;  She pricked
her ears, broke from me, and was out of sight in a
moment.</p>

<p>The man I had sent to the princess entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please to come this way, my lord,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p align="justify">My heart gave a throb, as if bracing
itself to the encounter.&#160;  I followed him through
many passages, and was at last shown into a room so
large and so dark that its walls were invisible.&#160;
 A single spot on the floor reflected a little light,
but around that spot all was black.&#160;  I looked
up, and saw at a great height an oval aperture in
the roof, on the periphery of which appeared the joints
between blocks of black marble.&#160;  The light on
the floor showed close fitting slabs of the same material.&#160;
 I found afterward that the elliptical wall as well
was of black marble, absorbing the little light that
reached it.&#160;  The roof was the long half of an
ellipsoid, and the opening in it was over one of the
foci of the ellipse of the floor.&#160;  I fancied
I caught sight of reddish lines, but when I would
have examined them, they were gone.</p>

<p align="justify">All at once, a radiant form stood
in the centre of the darkness, flashing a splendour
on every side.&#160;  Over a robe of soft white, her
hair streamed in a cataract, black as the marble on
which it fell.&#160; Her eyes were a luminous blackness;
her arms and feet like warm ivory.&#160;  She greeted
me with the innocent smile of a girl&#8212;&#173;and
in face, figure, and motion seemed but now to have
stepped over the threshold of womanhood.&#160;  &#8220;Alas,&#8221;
thought I, &#8220;ill did I reckon my danger!&#160;
 Can this be the woman I rescued&#8212;&#173;she who
struck me, scorned me, left me?&#8221;  I stood gazing
at her out of the darkness; she stood gazing into
it, as if searching for me.</p>

<p align="justify">She disappeared.&#160;  &#8220;She
will not acknowledge me!&#8221; I thought.&#160;  But
the next instant her eyes flashed out of the dark straight
into mine.&#160;  She had descried me and come to me!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have found me at last!&#8221;
she said, laying her hand on my shoulder.&#160;  &#8220;I
knew you would!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">My frame quivered with conflicting
consciousnesses, to analyse which I had no power.&#160;
 I was simultaneously attracted and repelled:&#160;
each sensation seemed either.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You shiver!&#8221; she said.&#160;
 &#8220;This place is cold for you!&#160;  Come.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I stood silent:&#160; she had struck
me dumb with beauty; she held me dumb with sweetness.</p>

<p align="justify">Taking me by the hand, she drew me
to the spot of light, and again flashed upon me.&#160;
 An instant she stood there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have grown brown since last I saw you,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This is almost the first roof
I have been under since you left me,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose was the other?&#8221; she rejoined.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know the woman&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I would gladly learn it!&#160;
 The instinct of hospitality is not strong in my people!&#8221;
She took me again by the hand, and led me through the
darkness many steps to a curtain of black.&#160;  Beyond
it was a white stair, up which she conducted me to
a beautiful chamber.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How you must miss the hot flowing
river!&#8221; she said.&#160;  &#8220;But there is
a bath in the corner with no white leeches in it!&#160;
 At the foot of your couch you will find a garment.&#160;
 When you come down, I shall be in the room to your
left at the foot of the stair.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I stood as she left me, accusing my
presumption:&#160; how was I to treat this lovely woman
as a thing of evil, who behaved to me like a sister?&#8212;&#173;Whence
the marvellous change in her?&#160;  She left me with
a blow; she received me almost with an embrace!&#160;
 She had reviled me; she said she knew I would follow
and find her!&#160;  Did she know my doubts concerning
her&#8212;&#173;how much I should want explained?&#160;
 <i>Could</i> she explain all?&#160;  Could I believe
her if she did?&#160;  As to her hospitality, I had
surely earned and might accept that&#8212;&#173;at least
until I came to a definite judgment concerning her!</p>

<p align="justify">Could such beauty as I saw, and such
wickedness as I suspected, exist in the same person?&#160;
 If they could, <i>how</i> was it possible?&#160;  Unable
to answer the former question, I must let the latter
wait!</p>

<p align="justify">Clear as crystal, the water in the
great white bath sent a sparkling flash from the corner
where it lay sunk in the marble floor, and seemed
to invite me to its embrace.&#160;  Except the hot stream,
two draughts in the cottage of the veiled woman, and
the pools in the track of the wounded leopardess,
I had not seen water since leaving home:&#160; it looked
a thing celestial.&#160;  I plunged in.</p>

<p align="justify">Immediately my brain was filled with
an odour strange and delicate, which yet I did not
altogether like.&#160;  It made me doubt the princess
afresh:&#160; had she medicated it? had she enchanted
it? was she in any way working on me unlawfully?&#160;
And how was there water in the palace, and not a drop
in the city?&#160;  I remembered the crushed paw of
the leopardess, and sprang from the bath.</p>

<p align="justify">What had I been bathing in?&#160; 
Again I saw the fleeing mother, again I heard the
howl, again I saw the limping beast.&#160;  But what
matter whence it flowed? was not the water sweet?&#160;
 Was it not very water the pitcher-plant secreted
from its heart, and stored for the weary traveller?&#160;
 Water came from heaven:&#160; what mattered the well
where it gathered, or the spring whence it burst?&#160;
 But I did not re-enter the bath.</p>

<p align="justify">I put on the robe of white wool, embroidered
on the neck and hem, that lay ready for me, and went
down the stair to the room whither my hostess had
directed me.&#160;  It was round, all of alabaster,
and without a single window:&#160; the light came through
everywhere, a soft, pearly shimmer rather than shine.&#160;
 Vague shadowy forms went flitting about over the
walls and low dome, like loose rain-clouds over a
grey-blue sky.</p>

<p align="justify">The princess stood waiting me, in
a robe embroidered with argentine rings and discs,
rectangles and lozenges, close together&#8212;&#173;a
silver mail.&#160;  It fell unbroken from her neck
and hid her feet, but its long open sleeves left her
arms bare.</p>

<p align="justify">In the room was a table of ivory,
bearing cakes and fruit, an ivory jug of milk, a crystal
jug of wine of a pale rose-colour, and a white loaf.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Here we do not kill to eat,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;but I think you will like what I
can give you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I told her I could desire nothing
better than what I saw.&#160;  She seated herself on
a couch by the table, and made me a sign to sit by
her.</p>

<p align="justify">She poured me out a bowlful of milk,
and, handing me the loaf, begged me to break from
it such a piece as I liked.&#160;  Then she filled from
the wine-jug two silver goblets of grotesquely graceful
workmanship.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have never drunk wine like this!&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p align="justify">I drank, and wondered:&#160; every
flower of Hybla and Hymettus must have sent its ghost
to swell the soul of that wine!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And now that you will be able
to listen,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I must do what
I can to make myself intelligible to you.&#160;  Our
natures, however, are so different, that this may
not be easy.&#160;  Men and women live but to die;
we, that is such as I&#8212;&#173;we are but a few&#8212;&#173;live
to live on.&#160;  Old age is to you a horror; to me
it is a dear desire:&#160; the older we grow, the nearer
we are to our perfection.&#160;  Your perfection is
a poor thing, comes soon, and lasts but a little while;
ours is a ceaseless ripening.&#160;  I am not yet ripe,
and have lived thousands of your years&#8212;&#173;how
many, I never cared to note.&#160;  The everlasting
will not be measured.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Many lovers have sought me;
I have loved none of them:&#160; they sought but to
enslave me; they sought me but as the men of my city
seek gems of price.&#8212;&#173;When you found me,
I found a man!&#160;  I put you to the test; you stood
it; your love was genuine!&#8212;&#173;It was, however,
far from ideal&#8212;&#173;far from such love as I
would have.&#160;  You loved me truly, but not with
true love.&#160;  Pity has, but is not love.&#160;  What
woman of any world would return love for pity?&#160;
 Such love as yours was then, is hateful to me.&#160;
 I knew that, if you saw me as I am, you would love
me&#8212;&#173;like the rest of them&#8212;&#173;to have
and to hold:&#160; I would none of that either!&#160;
 I would be otherwise loved!&#160;  I would have a love
that outlived hopelessness, outmeasured indifference,
hate, scorn!&#160; Therefore did I put on cruelty,
despite, ingratitude.&#160;  When I left you, I had
shown myself such as you could at least no longer follow
from pity:&#160; I was no longer in need of you!&#160;
 But you must satisfy my desire or set me free&#8212;&#173;prove
yourself priceless or worthless!&#160; To satisfy the
hunger of my love, you must follow me, looking for
nothing, not gratitude, not even pity in return!&#8212;&#173;follow
and find me, and be content with merest presence,
with scantest forbearance!&#8212;&#173; I, not you,
have failed; I yield the contest.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She looked at me tenderly, and hid
her face in her hands.&#160;  But I had caught a flash
and a sparkle behind the tenderness, and did not believe
her.&#160;  She laid herself out to secure and enslave
me; she only fascinated me!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Beautiful princess,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;let me understand how you came to be
found in such evil plight.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There are things I cannot explain,&#8221;
she replied, &#8220;until you have become capable
of understanding them&#8212;&#173;which can only be
when love is grown perfect.&#160;  There are many things
so hidden from you that you cannot even wish to know
them; but any question you can put, I can in some
measure answer.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I had set out to visit a part
of my dominions occupied by a savage dwarf-people,
strong and fierce, enemies to law and order, opposed
to every kind of progress&#8212;&#173;an evil race.&#160;
 I went alone, fearing nothing, unaware of the least
necessity for precaution.&#160;  I did not know that
upon the hot stream beside which you found me, a certain
woman, by no means so powerful as myself, not being
immortal, had cast what you call a spell&#8212;&#173;which
is merely the setting in motion of a force as natural
as any other, but operating primarily in a region
beyond the ken of the mortal who makes use of the force.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I set out on my journey, reached
the stream, bounded across it,&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A shadow of embarrassment darkened
her cheek:&#160; I understood it, but showed no sign.&#160;
 Checked for the merest moment, she went on:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8212;&#173;you know what a
step it is in parts!&#8212;&#173;But in the very act,
an indescribable cold invaded me.&#160;  I recognised
at once the nature of the assault, and knew it could
affect me but temporarily.&#160;  By sheer force of
will I dragged myself to the wood&#8212;&#173;nor knew
anything more until I saw you asleep, and the horrible
worm at your neck.&#160;  I crept out, dragged the
monster from you, and laid my lips to the wound.&#160;
You began to wake; I buried myself among the leaves.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She rose, her eyes flashing as never
human eyes flashed, and threw her arms high over her
head.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What you have made me is yours!&#8221;
she cried.&#160;  &#8220;I will repay you as never
yet did woman!&#160;  My power, my beauty, my love are
your own:&#160; take them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She dropt kneeling beside me, laid
her arms across my knees, and looked up in my face.</p>

<p align="justify">Then first I noted on her left hand
a large clumsy glove.&#160;  In my mind&#8217;s eye
I saw hair and claws under it, but I knew it was a
hand shut hard&#8212;&#173;perhaps badly bruised.&#160;
 I glanced at the other:&#160; it was lovely as hand
could be, and I felt that, if I did less than loathe
her, I should love her.&#160;  Not to dally with usurping
emotions, I turned my eyes aside.</p>

<p align="justify">She started to her feet.&#160;  I sat
motionless, looking down.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;To me she may be true!&#8221;
said my vanity.&#160;  For a moment I was tempted to
love a lie.</p>

<p align="justify">An odour, rather than the gentlest
of airy pulses, was fanning me.&#160; I glanced up.&#160;
 She stood erect before me, waving her lovely arms
in seemingly mystic fashion.</p>

<p align="justify">A frightful roar made my heart rebound
against the walls of its cage.&#160;  The alabaster
trembled as if it would shake into shivers.&#160; The
princess shuddered visibly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My wine was too strong for
you!&#8221; she said, in a quavering voice; &#8220;I
ought not to have let you take a full draught!&#160;
 Go and sleep now, and when you wake ask me what you
please.&#8212;&#173;I will go with you:&#160; come.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she preceded me up the stair,&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not wonder that roar startled
you!&#8221; she said.&#160;  &#8220;It startled me,
I confess:&#160; for a moment I feared she had escaped.&#160;
 But that is impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The roar seemed to me, however&#8212;&#173;I
could not tell why&#8212;&#173;to come from the <i>white</i>
leopardess, and to be meant for me, not the princess.</p>

<p align="justify">With a smile she left me at the door
of my room, but as she turned I read anxiety on her
beautiful face.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXVI</h1>

<p><b>A BATTLE ROYAL</b></p>

<p align="justify">I threw myself on the bed, and began
to turn over in my mind the tale she had told me.&#160;
 She had forgotten herself, and, by a single incautious
word, removed one perplexity as to the condition in
which I found her in the forest!&#160;  The leopardess
<i>bounded</i> over; the princess lay prostrate on the
bank:&#160; the running stream had dissolved her self-enchantment!&#160;
 Her own account of the object of her journey revealed
the danger of the Little Ones then imminent:&#160; I
had saved the life of their one fearful enemy!</p>

<p align="justify">I had but reached this conclusion
when I fell asleep.&#160;  The lovely wine may not
have been quite innocent.</p>

<p align="justify">When I opened my eyes, it was night.&#160;
 A lamp, suspended from the ceiling, cast a clear,
although soft light through the chamber.&#160;  A delicious
languor infolded me.&#160;  I seemed floating, far from
land, upon the bosom of a twilight sea.&#160;  Existence
was in itself pleasure.&#160; I had no pain.&#160; 
Surely I was dying!</p>

<p align="justify">No pain!&#8212;&#173;ah, what a shoot
of mortal pain was that! what a sickening sting!&#160;
 It went right through my heart!&#160; Again!&#160; That
was sharpness itself!&#8212;&#173;and so sickening!&#160;
 I could not move my hand to lay it on my heart; something
kept it down!</p>

<p align="justify">The pain was dying away, but my whole
body seemed paralysed.&#160;  Some evil thing was upon
me!&#8212;&#173;something hateful!&#160;  I would have
struggled, but could not reach a struggle.&#160;  My
will agonised, but in vain, to assert itself.&#160;
 I desisted, and lay passive.&#160;  Then I became aware
of a soft hand on my face, pressing my head into the
pillow, and of a heavy weight lying across me.</p>

<p align="justify">I began to breathe more freely; the
weight was gone from my chest; I opened my eyes.</p>

<p align="justify">The princess was standing above me
on the bed, looking out into the room, with the air
of one who dreamed.&#160;  Her great eyes were clear
and calm.&#160;  Her mouth wore a look of satisfied
passion; she wiped from it a streak of red.</p>

<p align="justify">She caught my gaze, bent down, and
struck me on the eyes with the handkerchief in her
hand:&#160; it was like drawing the edge of a knife
across them, and for a moment or two I was blind.</p>

<p align="justify">I heard a dull heavy sound, as of
a large soft-footed animal alighting from a little
jump.&#160;  I opened my eyes, and saw the great swing
of a long tail as it disappeared through the half-open
doorway.&#160; I sprang after it.</p>

<p align="justify">The creature had vanished quite.&#160;
 I shot down the stair, and into the hall of alabaster.&#160;
 The moon was high, and the place like the inside
of a faint, sun-blanched moon.&#160;  The princess was
not there.&#160; I must find her:&#160; in her presence
I might protect myself; out of it I could not!&#160;
 I was a tame animal for her to feed upon; a human
fountain for a thirst demoniac!&#160;  She showed me
favour the more easily to use me!&#160;  My waking
eyes did not fear her, but they would close, and she
would come!&#160;  Not seeing her, I felt her everywhere,
for she might be anywhere&#8212;&#173;might even now
be waiting me in some secret cavern of sleep!&#160;
 Only with my eyes upon her could I feel safe from
her!</p>

<p align="justify">Outside the alabaster hall it was
pitch-dark, and I had to grope my way along with hands
and feet.&#160;  At last I felt a curtain, put it aside,
and entered the black hall.&#160;  There I found a great
silent assembly.&#160;  How it was visible I neither
saw nor could imagine, for the walls, the floor, the
roof, were shrouded in what seemed an infinite blackness,
blacker than the blackest of moonless, starless nights;
yet my eyes could separate, although vaguely, not a
few of the individuals in the mass interpenetrated
and divided, as well as surrounded, by the darkness.&#160;
 It seemed as if my eyes would never come quite to
themselves.&#160;  I pressed their balls and looked
and looked again, but what I saw would not grow distinct.&#160;
 Blackness mingled with form, silence and undefined
motion possessed the wide space.&#160;  All was a dim,
confused dance, filled with recurrent glimpses of
shapes not unknown to me.&#160;  Now appeared a woman,
with glorious eyes looking out of a skull; now an
armed figure on a skeleton horse; now one now another
of the hideous burrowing phantasms.&#160;  I could
trace no order and little relation in the mingling
and crossing currents and eddies.&#160;  If I seemed
to catch the shape and rhythm of a dance, it was but
to see it break, and confusion prevail.&#160;  With
the shifting colours of the seemingly more solid shapes,
mingled a multitude of shadows, independent apparently
of originals, each moving after its own free shadow-will.&#160;
 I looked everywhere for the princess, but throughout
the wildly changing kaleidoscopic scene, could not
see her nor discover indication of her presence.&#160;
 Where was she?&#160;  What might she not be doing?&#160;
 No one took the least notice of me as I wandered
hither and thither seeking her.&#160;  At length losing
hope, I turned away to look elsewhere.&#160;  Finding
the wall, and keeping to it with my hand, for even
then I could not see it, I came, groping along, to
a curtained opening into the vestibule.</p>

<p align="justify">Dimly moonlighted, the cage of the
leopardess was the arena of what seemed a desperate
although silent struggle.&#160;  Two vastly differing
forms, human and bestial, with entangled confusion
of mingling bodies and limbs, writhed and wrestled
in closest embrace.&#160;  It had lasted but an instant
when I saw the leopardess out of the cage, walking
quietly to the open door.&#160;  As I hastened after
her I threw a glance behind me:&#160; there was the
leopardess in the cage, couching motionless as when
I saw her first.</p>

<p align="justify">The moon, half-way up the sky, was
shining round and clear; the bodiless shadow I had
seen the night before, was walking through the trees
toward the gate; and after him went the leopardess,
swinging her tail.&#160;  I followed, a little way
off, as silently as they, and neither of them once
looked round.&#160;  Through the open gate we went
down to the city, lying quiet as the moonshine upon
it.&#160;  The face of the moon was very still, and
its stillness looked like that of expectation.</p>

<p align="justify">The Shadow took his way straight to
the stair at the top of which I had lain the night
before.&#160;  Without a pause he went up, and the
leopardess followed.&#160;  I quickened my pace, but,
a moment after, heard a cry of horror.&#160;  Then
came the fall of something soft and heavy between
me and the stair, and at my feet lay a body, frightfully
blackened and crushed, but still recognisable as that
of the woman who had led me home and shut me out.&#160;
 As I stood petrified, the spotted leopardess came
bounding down the stair with a baby in her mouth.&#160;
 I darted to seize her ere she could turn at the foot;
but that instant, from behind me, the white leopardess,
like a great bar of glowing silver, shot through the
moonlight, and had her by the neck.&#160;  She dropped
the child; I caught it up, and stood to watch the
battle between them.</p>

<p align="justify">What a sight it was&#8212;&#173;now
the one, now the other uppermost, both too intent
for any noise beyond a low growl, a whimpered cry,
or a snarl of hate&#8212;&#173;followed by a quicker
scrambling of claws, as each, worrying and pushing
and dragging, struggled for foothold on the pavement!&#160;
The spotted leopardess was larger than the white, and
I was anxious for my friend; but I soon saw that,
though neither stronger nor more active, the white
leopardess had the greater endurance.&#160;  Not once
did she lose her hold on the neck of the other.&#160;
 From the spotted throat at length issued a howl of
agony, changing, by swift-crowded gradations, into
the long-drawn <i>crescendo</i> of a woman&#8217;s uttermost
wail.&#160;  The white one relaxed her jaws; the spotted
one drew herself away, and rose on her hind legs.&#160;
 Erect in the moonlight stood the princess, a confused
rush of shadows careering over her whiteness&#8212;&#173;the
spots of the leopard crowding, hurrying, fleeing to
the refuge of her eyes, where merging they vanished.&#160;
The last few, outsped and belated, mingled with the
cloud of her streamy hair, leaving her radiant as
the moon when a legion of little vapours has flown,
wind-hunted, off her silvery disc&#8212;&#173;save
that, adown the white column of her throat, a thread
of blood still trickled from every wound of her adversary&#8217;s
terrible teeth.&#160;  She turned away, took a few
steps with the gait of a Hecate, fell, covered afresh
with her spots, and fled at a long, stretching gallop.</p>

<p align="justify">The white leopardess turned also,
sprang upon me, pulled my arms asunder, caught the
baby as it fell, and flew with it along the street
toward the gate</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXVII</h1>

<p><b>THE SILENT FOUNTAIN</b></p>

<p align="justify">I turned and followed the spotted
leopardess, catching but one glimpse of her as she
tore up the brow of the hill to the gate of the palace.&#160;
 When I reached the entrance-hall, the princess was
just throwing the robe around her which she had left
on the floor.&#160; The blood had ceased to flow from
her wounds, and had dried in the wind of her flight.</p>

<p align="justify">When she saw me, a flash of anger
crossed her face, and she turned her head aside.&#160;
 Then, with an attempted smile, she looked at me,
and said,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have met with a small accident!&#160;
 Happening to hear that the cat-woman was again in
the city, I went down to send her away.&#160;  But
she had one of her horrid creatures with her:&#160;
it sprang upon me, and had its claws in my neck before
I could strike it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She gave a shiver, and I could not
help pitying her, although I knew she lied, for her
wounds were real, and her face reminded me of how
she looked in the cave.&#160;  My heart began to reproach
me that I had let her fight unaided, and I suppose
I looked the compassion I felt.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Child of folly!&#8221; she
said, with another attempted smile, &#8220;&#8212;&#173;not
crying, surely!&#8212;&#173;Wait for me here; I am going
into the black hall for a moment.&#160;  I want you
to get me something for my scratches.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But I followed her close.&#160;  Out
of my sight I feared her.</p>

<p align="justify">The instant the princess entered,
I heard a buzzing sound as of many low voices, and,
one portion after another, the assembly began to be
shiftingly illuminated, as by a ray that went travelling
from spot to spot.&#160;  Group after group would shine
out for a space, then sink back into the general vagueness,
while another part of the vast company would grow
momently bright.</p>

<p align="justify">Some of the actions going on when
thus illuminated, were not unknown to me; I had been
in them, or had looked on them, and so had the princess:&#160;
present with every one of them I now saw her.&#160;
 The skull-headed dancers footed the grass in the
forest-hall:&#160; there was the princess looking in
at the door!&#160;  The fight went on in the Evil Wood:&#160;
there was the princess urging it!&#160;  Yet I was close
behind her all the time, she standing motionless,
her head sunk on her bosom.&#160; The confused murmur
continued, the confused commotion of colours and shapes;
and still the ray went shifting and showing.&#160; 
It settled at last on the hollow in the heath, and
there was the princess, walking up and down, and trying
in vain to wrap the vapour around her!&#160;  Then
first I was startled at what I saw:&#160; the old librarian
walked up to her, and stood for a moment regarding
her; she fell; her limbs forsook her and fled; her
body vanished.</p>

<p align="justify">A wild shriek rang through the echoing
place, and with the fall of her eidolon, the princess
herself, till then standing like a statue in front
of me, fell heavily, and lay still.&#160;  I turned
at once and went out:&#160; not again would I seek
to restore her!&#160;  As I stood trembling beside
the cage, I knew that in the black ellipsoid I had
been in the brain of the princess!&#8212;&#173;I saw
the tail of the leopardess quiver once.</p>

<p align="justify">While still endeavouring to compose
myself, I heard the voice of the princess beside me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Come now,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;I will show you what I want you to do for me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She led the way into the court.&#160;
 I followed in dazed compliance.</p>

<p align="justify">The moon was near the zenith, and
her present silver seemed brighter than the gold of
the absent sun.&#160;  She brought me through the trees
to the tallest of them, the one in the centre.&#160;
 It was not quite like the rest, for its branches,
drawing their ends together at the top, made a clump
that looked from beneath like a fir-cone.&#160;  The
princess stood close under it, gazing up, and said,
as if talking to herself,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;On the summit of that tree
grows a tiny blossom which would at once heal my scratches!&#160;
 I might be a dove for a moment and fetch it, but
I see a little snake in the leaves whose bite would
be worse to a dove than the bite of a tiger to me!&#8212;&#173;How
I hate that cat-woman!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She turned to me quickly, saying with
one of her sweetest smiles,</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you climb?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The smile vanished with the brief
question, and her face changed to a look of sadness
and suffering.&#160;  I ought to have left her to suffer,
but the way she put her hand to her wounded neck went
to my heart.</p>

<p align="justify">I considered the tree.&#160;  All the
way up to the branches, were projections on the stem
like the remnants on a palm of its fallen leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can climb that tree,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with bare feet!&#8221; she returned.</p>

<p align="justify">In my haste to follow the leopardess
disappearing, I had left my sandals in my room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no matter,&#8221; I said; &#8220;I have
long gone barefoot!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Again I looked at the tree, and my
eyes went wandering up the stem until my sight lost
itself in the branches.&#160;  The moon shone like
silvery foam here and there on the rugged bole, and
a little rush of wind went through the top with a
murmurous sound as of water falling softly into water.&#160;
 I approached the tree to begin my ascent of it.&#160;
 The princess stopped me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot let you attempt it
with your feet bare!&#8221; she insisted.&#160; &#8220;A
fall from the top would kill you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So would a bite from the snake!&#8221;
I answered&#8212;&#173;not believing, I confess, that
there was any snake.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It would not hurt <i>you</i>!&#8221;
she replied.  &#8220;&#8212;&#173;Wait a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She tore from her garment the two
wide borders that met in front, and kneeling on one
knee, made me put first my left foot, then my right
on the other, and bound them about with the thick embroidered
strips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have left the ends hanging, princess!&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have nothing to cut them
off with; but they are not long enough to get entangled,&#8221;
she replied.</p>

<p>I turned to the tree, and began to climb.</p>

<p align="justify">Now in Bulika the cold after sundown
was not so great as in certain other parts of the
country&#8212;&#173;especially about the sexton&#8217;s
cottage; yet when I had climbed a little way, I began
to feel very cold, grew still colder as I ascended,
and became coldest of all when I got among the branches.&#160;
 Then I shivered, and seemed to have lost my hands
and feet.</p>

<p align="justify">There was hardly any wind, and the
branches did not sway in the least, yet, as I approached
the summit, I became aware of a peculiar unsteadiness:&#160;
every branch on which I placed foot or laid hold,
seemed on the point of giving way.&#160;  When my head
rose above the branches near the top, and in the open
moonlight I began to look about for the blossom, that
instant I found myself drenched from head to foot.&#160;
 The next, as if plunged in a stormy water, I was
flung about wildly, and felt myself sinking.&#160; 
Tossed up and down, tossed this way and tossed that
way, rolled over and over, checked, rolled the other
way and tossed up again, I was sinking lower and lower.&#160;
 Gasping and gurgling and choking, I fell at last upon
a solid bottom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you so!&#8221; croaked a voice in my
ear.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXVIII</h1>

<p><b>I AM SILENCED</b></p>

<p align="justify">I rubbed the water out of my eyes,
and saw the raven on the edge of a huge stone basin.&#160;
 With the cold light of the dawn reflected from his
glossy plumage, he stood calmly looking down upon me.&#160;
 I lay on my back in water, above which, leaning on
my elbows, I just lifted my face.&#160;  I was in the
basin of the large fountain constructed by my father
in the middle of the lawn.&#160;  High over me glimmered
the thick, steel-shiny stalk, shooting, with a torrent
uprush, a hundred feet into the air, to spread in
a blossom of foam.</p>

<p>Nettled at the coolness of the raven&#8217;s remark,</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me nothing!&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you to do nothing any one you distrusted
asked you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut! how was mortal to remember that?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You will not forget the consequences
of having forgotten it!&#8221; replied Mr. Raven,
who stood leaning over the margin of the basin, and
stretched his hand across to me.</p>

<p align="justify">I took it, and was immediately beside
him on the lawn, dripping and streaming.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You must change your clothes
at once!&#8221; he said.&#160;  &#8220;A wetting does
not signify where you come from&#8212;&#173;though at
present such an accident is unusual; here it has its
inconveniences!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He was again a raven, walking, with
something stately in his step, toward the house, the
door of which stood open.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have not much to change!&#8221;
I laughed; for I had flung aside my robe to climb
the tree.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is a long time since I moulted
a feather!&#8221; said the raven.</p>

<p align="justify">In the house no one seemed awake.&#160;
 I went to my room, found a dressing-gown, and descended
to the library.</p>

<p align="justify">As I entered, the librarian came from
the closet.&#160;  I threw myself on a couch.&#160;
 Mr. Raven drew a chair to my side and sat down.&#160;
 For a minute or two neither spoke.&#160;  I was the
first to break the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it all mean?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A good question!&#8221; he
rejoined:&#160; &#8220;nobody knows what anything is;
a man can learn only what a thing means!&#160;  Whether
he do, depends on the use he is making of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made no use of anything yet!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not much; but you know the
fact, and that is something!&#160;  Most people take
more than a lifetime to learn that they have learned
nothing, and done less!&#160;  At least you have not
been without the desire to be of use!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I did want to do something
for the children&#8212;&#173;the precious Little Ones,
I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you did&#8212;&#173;and started the wrong
way!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know the right way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true also&#8212;&#173;but you are to
blame that you did not.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am ready to believe whatever
you tell me&#8212;&#173;as soon as I understand what
it means.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Had you accepted our invitation,
you would have known the right way.&#160;  When a man
will not act where he is, he must go far to find his
work.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Indeed I have gone far, and
got nowhere, for I have not found my work!&#160;  I
left the children to learn how to serve them, and have
only learned the danger they are in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;When you were with them, you
were where you could help them:&#160; you left your
work to look for it!&#160;  It takes a wise man to know
when to go away; a fool may learn to go back at once!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Do you mean, sir, I could have
done something for the Little Ones by staying with
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you teach them anything by leaving them?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No; but how could I teach them?&#160;
 I did not know how to begin.&#160; Besides, they were
far ahead of me!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is true.&#160;  But you
were not a rod to measure them with!&#160; Certainly,
if they knew what you know, not to say what you might
have known, they would be ahead of you&#8212;&#173;out
of sight ahead! but you saw they were not growing&#8212;&#173;or
growing so slowly that they had not yet developed
the idea of growing! they were even afraid of growing!&#8212;&#173;You
had never seen children remain children!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely I had no power to make them grow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have removed some of the hindrances
to their growing!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What are they?&#160;  I do not
know them.&#160;  I did think perhaps it was the want
of water!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is! they have none to cry with!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would gladly have kept them from requiring
any for that purpose!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No doubt you would&#8212;&#173;the
aim of all stupid philanthropists!&#160;  Why, Mr.
Vane, but for the weeping in it, your world would never
have become worth saving!&#160;  You confess you thought
it might be water they wanted:&#160; why did not you
dig them a well or two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That never entered my mind!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not when the sounds of the
waters under the earth entered your ears?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I believe it did once.&#160;
 But I was afraid of the giants for them.&#160; That
was what made me bear so much from the brutes myself!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Indeed you almost taught the
noble little creatures to be afraid of the stupid
Bags!&#160;  While they fed and comforted and worshipped
you, all the time you submitted to be the slave of
bestial men!&#160; You gave the darlings a seeming
coward for their hero!&#160;  A worse wrong you could
hardly have done them.&#160;  They gave you their hearts;
you owed them your soul!&#8212;&#173;You might by this
time have made the Bags hewers of wood and drawers
of water to the Little Ones!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I fear what you say is true,
Mr. Raven!&#160;  But indeed I was afraid that more
knowledge might prove an injury to them&#8212;&#173;render
them less innocent, less lovely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They had given you no reason to harbour such
a fear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not a little knowledge a dangerous thing?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is one of the pet falsehoods
of your world!&#160;  Is man&#8217;s greatest knowledge
more than a little? or is it therefore dangerous?&#160;
 The fancy that knowledge is in itself a great thing,
would make any degree of knowledge more dangerous
than any amount of ignorance.&#160; To know all things
would not be greatness.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;At least it was for love of
them, not from cowardice that I served the giants!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Granted.&#160;  But you ought
to have served the Little Ones, not the giants!&#160;
 You ought to have given the Little Ones water; then
they would soon have taught the giants their true
position.&#160;  In the meantime you could yourself
have made the giants cut down two-thirds of their
coarse fruit-trees to give room to the little delicate
ones!&#160;  You lost your chance with the Lovers, Mr.
Vane!&#160;  You speculated about them instead of helping
them!&#8221;</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXIX</h1>

<p><b>THE PERSIAN CAT</b></p>

<p align="justify">I sat in silence and shame.&#160; 
What he said was true:&#160; I had not been a wise
neighbour to the Little Ones!</p>

<p>Mr. Raven resumed:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You wronged at the same time
the stupid creatures themselves.&#160;  For them slavery
would have been progress.&#160;  To them a few such
lessons as you could have given them with a stick
from one of their own trees, would have been invaluable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know they were cowards!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What difference does that make?&#160;
 The man who grounds his action on another&#8217;s
cowardice, is essentially a coward himself.&#8212;&#173;I
fear worse will come of it!&#160;  By this time the
Little Ones might have been able to protect themselves
from the princess, not to say the giants&#8212;&#173;they
were always fit enough for that; as it was they laughed
at them! but now, through your relations with her,&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate her!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you let her know you hated her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again I was silent.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not even to her have you been
faithful!&#8212;&#173;But hush! we were followed from
the fountain, I fear!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No living creature did I see!&#8212;&#173;except
a disreputable-looking cat that bolted into the shrubbery.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was a magnificent Persian&#8212;&#173;so
wet and draggled, though, as to look what she was&#8212;&#173;worse
than disreputable!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What do you mean, Mr. Raven?&#8221;
I cried, a fresh horror taking me by the throat. 
&#8220;&#8212;&#173;There was a beautiful blue Persian
about the house, but she fled at the very sound of
water!&#8212;&#173;Could she have been after the goldfish?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We shall see!&#8221; returned
the librarian.&#160;  &#8220;I know a little about
cats of several sorts, and there is that in the room
which will unmask this one, or I am mistaken in her.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He rose, went to the door of the closet,
brought from it the mutilated volume, and sat down
again beside me.&#160;  I stared at the book in his
hand:&#160; it was a whole book, entire and sound!</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was the other half of it?&#8221; I gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sticking through into my library,&#8221; he
answered.</p>

<p align="justify">I held my peace.&#160;  A single question
more would have been a plunge into a bottomless sea,
and there might be no time!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said:&#160;
&#8220;I am going to read a stanza or two.&#160;  There
is one present who, I imagine, will hardly enjoy the
reading!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He opened the vellum cover, and turned
a leaf or two.&#160;  The parchment was discoloured
with age, and one leaf showed a dark stain over two-thirds
of it.&#160;  He slowly turned this also, and seemed
looking for a certain passage in what appeared a continuous
poem.&#160;  Somewhere about the middle of the book
he began to read.</p>

<p align="justify">But what follows represents&#8212;&#173;not
what he read, only the impression it made upon me.&#160;
 The poem seemed in a language I had never before
heard, which yet I understood perfectly, although I
could not write the words, or give their meaning save
in poor approximation.&#160;  These fragments, then,
are the shapes which those he read have finally taken
in passing again through my brain:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;But if I found
a man that could believe<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In
what he saw not, felt not, and yet knew,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From him I should
take substance, and receive<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Firmness
and form relate to touch and view;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then
should I clothe me in the likeness true<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of that idea where
his soul did cleave!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned a leaf and read again:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;In me was every
woman.&#160;  I had power<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over
the soul of every living man,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such as no woman
ever had in dower&#8212;&#173;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Could
what no woman ever could, or can;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All
women, I, the woman, still outran,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Outsoared, outsank,
outreigned, in hall or bower.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;For I, though
me he neither saw nor heard,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor
with his hand could touch finger of mine,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although not once
my breath had ever stirred<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A
hair of him, could trammel brain and spine<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With
rooted bonds which Death could not untwine&#8212;&#173;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or life, though
hope were evermore deferred.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Again he paused, again turned a leaf,
and again began:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;For by his side
I lay, a bodiless thing;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I
breathed not, saw not, felt not, only thought,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And made him love
me&#8212;&#173;with a hungering<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After
he knew not what&#8212;&#173;if it was aught<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or
but a nameless something that was wrought<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By him out of
himself; for I did sing</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;A song that had
no sound into his soul;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I
lay a heartless thing against his heart,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Giving him nothing
where he gave his whole<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Being
to clothe me human, every part:&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That
I at last into his sense might dart,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus first into
his living mind I stole.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Ah, who was ever
conquering Love but I!&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who
else did ever throne in heart of man!&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To visible being,
with a gladsome cry<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Waking,
life&#8217;s tremor through me throbbing ran!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A strange, repulsive feline wail arose
somewhere in the room.&#160;  I started up on my elbow
and stared about me, but could see nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Raven turned several leaves, and went on:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Sudden I woke,
nor knew the ghastly fear<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That
held me&#8212;&#173;not like serpent coiled about,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But like a vapour
moist, corrupt, and drear,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Filling
heart, soul, and breast and brain throughout;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My
being lay motionless in sickening doubt,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor dared to ask
how came the horror here.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;My past entire
I knew, but not my now;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I
understood nor what I was, nor where;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I knew what I
had been:&#160; still on my brow<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I
felt the touch of what no more was there!&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I
was a fainting, dead, yet live Despair;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A life that flouted
life with mop and mow!</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;That I was a
queen I knew right well,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And
sometimes wore a splendour on my head<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whose flashing
even dead darkness could not quell&#8212;&#173;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The
like on neck and arms and girdle-stead;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And
men declared a light my closed eyes shed<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That killed the
diamond in its silver cell.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Again I heard the ugly cry of feline
pain.&#160;  Again I looked, but saw neither shape
nor motion.&#160;  Mr. Raven seemed to listen a moment,
but again turned several pages, and resumed:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Hideously wet,
my hair of golden hue<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fouled
my fair hands:&#160; to have it swiftly shorn<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I had given my
rubies, all for me dug new&#8212;&#173;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No
eyes had seen, and such no waist had worn!&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For
a draught of water from a drinking horn,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For one blue breath,
I had given my sapphires blue!</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Nay, I had given
my opals for a smock,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A
peasant-maiden&#8217;s garment, coarse and clean:&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My shroud was
rotting!&#160;  Once I heard a cock<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lustily
crow upon the hillock green<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over
my coffin.&#160;  Dulled by space between,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Came back an answer
like a ghostly mock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more arose the bestial wail.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I thought some foul thing was
in the room!&#8221; said the librarian, casting a
glance around him; but instantly he turned a leaf or
two, and again read:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;For I had bathed
in milk and honey-dew,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In
rain from roses shook, that ne&#8217;er touched earth,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And ointed me
with nard of amber hue;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Never
had spot me spotted from my birth,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or
mole, or scar of hurt, or fret of dearth;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Never one hair
superfluous on me grew.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Fleeing cold
whiteness, I would sit alone&#8212;&#173;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not
in the sun&#8212;&#173;I feared his bronzing light,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in his radiance
back around me thrown<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By
fulgent mirrors tempering his might;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus
bathing in a moon-bath not too bright,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My skin I tinted
slow to ivory tone.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;But now, all
round was dark, dark all within!&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My
eyes not even gave out a phantom-flash;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My fingers sank
in pulp through pulpy skin;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My
body lay death-weltered in a mash<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of
slimy horrors&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">With a fearsome yell, her clammy fur
staring in clumps, her tail thick as a cable, her
eyes flashing green as a chrysoprase, her distended
claws entangling themselves so that she floundered
across the carpet, a huge white cat rushed from somewhere,
and made for the chimney.&#160;  Quick as thought the
librarian threw the manuscript between her and the
hearth.&#160;  She crouched instantly, her eyes fixed
on the book.&#160;  But his voice went on as if still
he read, and his eyes seemed also fixed on the book:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Ah, the two worlds!
so strangely are they one,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And
yet so measurelessly wide apart!&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oh, had I lived
the bodiless alone<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And
from defiling sense held safe my heart,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then
had I scaped the canker and the smart,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scaped life-in-death,
scaped misery&#8217;s endless moan!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">At these words such a howling, such
a prolonged yell of agony burst from the cat, that
we both stopped our ears.&#160;  When it ceased, Mr.
Raven walked to the fire-place, took up the book, and,
standing between the creature and the chimney, pointed
his finger at her for a moment.&#160;  She lay perfectly
still.&#160;  He took a half-burnt stick from the hearth,
drew with it some sign on the floor, put the manuscript
back in its place, with a look that seemed to say,
&#8220;Now we have her, I think!&#8221; and, returning
to the cat, stood over her and said, in a still, solemn
voice:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Lilith, when you came here
on the way to your evil will, you little thought into
whose hands you were delivering yourself!&#8212;&#173;
Mr. Vane, when God created me,&#8212;&#173;not out of
Nothing, as say the unwise, but out of His own endless
glory&#8212;&#173;He brought me an angelic splendour
to be my wife:&#160; there she lies!&#160;  For her first
thought was <i>power</i>; she counted it slavery to
be one with me, and bear children for Him who gave
her being.&#160;  One child, indeed, she bore; then,
puffed with the fancy that she had created her, would
have me fall down and worship her!&#160;  Finding,
however, that I would but love and honour, never obey
and worship her, she poured out her blood to escape
me, fled to the army of the aliens, and soon had so
ensnared the heart of the great Shadow, that he became
her slave, wrought her will, and made her queen of
Hell.&#160;  How it is with her now, she best knows,
but I know also.&#160;  The one child of her body she
fears and hates, and would kill, asserting a right,
which is a lie, over what God sent through her into
His new world.&#160;  Of creating, she knows no more
than the crystal that takes its allotted shape, or
the worm that makes two worms when it is cloven asunder.&#160;
 Vilest of God&#8217;s creatures, she lives by the
blood and lives and souls of men.&#160;  She consumes
and slays, but is powerless to destroy as to create.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The animal lay motionless, its beryl
eyes fixed flaming on the man:&#160; his eyes on hers
held them fixed that they could not move from his.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then God gave me another wife&#8212;&#173;not
an angel but a woman&#8212;&#173;who is to this as
light is to darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The cat gave a horrible screech, and
began to grow bigger.&#160;  She went on growing and
growing.&#160;  At last the spotted leopardess uttered
a roar that made the house tremble.&#160;  I sprang
to my feet.&#160;  I do not think Mr. Raven started
even with his eyelids.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is but her jealousy that
speaks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;jealousy self-kindled,
foiled and fruitless; for here I am, her master now
whom she, would not have for her husband! while my
beautiful Eve yet lives, hoping immortally!&#160; 
Her hated daughter lives also, but beyond her evil
ken, one day to be what she counts her destruction&#8212;&#173;for
even Lilith shall be saved by her childbearing.&#160;
 Meanwhile she exults that my human wife plunged herself
and me in despair, and has borne me a countless race
of miserables; but my Eve repented, and is now beautiful
as never was woman or angel, while her groaning, travailing
world is the nursery of our Father&#8217;s children.&#160;
 I too have repented, and am blessed.&#8212;&#173;Thou,
Lilith, hast not yet repented; but thou must.&#8212;&#173;Tell
me, is the great Shadow beautiful?&#160;  Knowest thou
how long thou wilt thyself remain beautiful?&#8212;&#173;Answer
me, if thou knowest.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Then at last I understood that Mr.
Raven was indeed Adam, the old and the new man; and
that his wife, ministering in the house of the dead,
was Eve, the mother of us all, the lady of the New
Jerusalem.</p>

<p align="justify">The leopardess reared; the flickering
and fleeing of her spots began; the princess at length
stood radiant in her perfect shape.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I <i>am</i> beautiful&#8212;&#173;and
immortal!&#8221; she said&#8212;&#173;and she looked
the goddess she would be.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;As a bush that burns, and is
consumed,&#8221; answered he who had been her husband.
 &#8220;&#8212;&#173;What is that under thy right hand?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">For her arm lay across her bosom,
and her hand was pressed to her side.</p>

<p>A swift pang contorted her beautiful face, and passed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is but a leopard-spot that
lingers! it will quickly follow those I have dismissed,&#8221;
she answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Thou art beautiful because
God created thee, but thou art the slave of sin:&#160;
take thy hand from thy side.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Her hand sank away, and as it dropt
she looked him in the eyes with a quailing fierceness
that had in it no surrender.</p>

<p>He gazed a moment at the spot.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is not on the leopard; it
is in the woman!&#8221; he said.&#160;  &#8220;Nor will
it leave thee until it hath eaten to thy heart, and
thy beauty hath flowed from thee through the open
wound!&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a glance downward, and shivered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Lilith,&#8221; said Adam, and
his tone had changed to a tender beseeching, &#8220;hear
me, and repent, and He who made thee will cleanse thee!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Her hand returned quivering to her
side.&#160;  Her face grew dark.&#160;  She gave the
cry of one from whom hope is vanishing.&#160;  The cry
passed into a howl.&#160;  She lay writhing on the
floor, a leopardess covered with spots.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The evil thou meditatest,&#8221;
Adam resumed, &#8220;thou shalt never compass, Lilith,
for Good and not Evil is the Universe.&#160;  The battle
between them may last for countless ages, but it must
end:&#160; how will it fare with thee when Time hath
vanished in the dawn of the eternal morn?&#160; Repent,
I beseech thee; repent, and be again an angel of God!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She rose, she stood upright, a woman
once more, and said,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will not repent.&#160;  I
will drink the blood of thy child.&#8221;&#160; My
eyes were fastened on the princess; but when Adam spoke,
I turned to him:&#160; he stood towering above her;
the form of his visage was altered, and his voice
was terrible.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Down!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;or
by the power given me I will melt thy very bones.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She flung herself on the floor, dwindled
and dwindled, and was again a gray cat.&#160;  Adam
caught her up by the skin of her neck, bore her to
the closet, and threw her in.&#160;  He described a
strange figure on the threshold, and closing the door,
locked it.</p>

<p align="justify">Then he returned to my side the old
librarian, looking sad and worn, and furtively wiping
tears from his eyes.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXX</h1>

<p><b>ADAM EXPLAINS</b></p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We must be on our guard,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;or she will again outwit us.&#160;
She would befool the very elect!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are we to be on our guard?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Every way,&#8221; he answered.&#160;
 &#8220;She fears, therefore hates her child, and
is in this house on her way to destroy her.&#160;  The
birth of children is in her eyes the death of their
parents, and every new generation the enemy of the
last.&#160;  Her daughter appears to her an open channel
through which her immortality&#8212;&#173;which yet
she counts self-inherent&#8212;&#173;is flowing fast
away:&#160; to fill it up, almost from her birth she
has pursued her with an utter enmity.&#160;  But the
result of her machinations hitherto is, that in the
region she claims as her own, has appeared a colony
of children, to which that daughter is heart and head
and sheltering wings.&#160;  My Eve longed after the
child, and would have been to her as a mother to her
first-born, but we were then unfit to train her:&#160;
she was carried into the wilderness, and for ages
we knew nothing of her fate.&#160;  But she was divinely
fostered, and had young angels for her playmates;
nor did she ever know care until she found a baby
in the wood, and the mother-heart in her awoke.&#160;
One by one she has found many children since, and that
heart is not yet full.&#160;  Her family is her absorbing
charge, and never children were better mothered.&#160;
 Her authority over them is without appeal, but it
is unknown to herself, and never comes to the surface
except in watchfulness and service.&#160;  She has
forgotten the time when she lived without them, and
thinks she came herself from the wood, the first of
the family.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have saved the life of
her and their enemy; therefore your life belongs to
her and them.&#160;  The princess was on her way to
destroy them, but as she crossed that stream, vengeance
overtook her, and she would have died had you not
come to her aid.&#160;  You did; and ere now she would
have been raging among the Little Ones, had she dared
again cross the stream.&#160;  But there was yet a way
to the blessed little colony through the world of
the three dimensions; only, from that, by the slaying
of her former body, she had excluded herself, and
except in personal contact with one belonging to it,
could not re-enter it.&#160;  You provided the opportunity:&#160;
never, in all her long years, had she had one before.&#160;
 Her hand, with lightest touch, was on one or other
of your muffled feet, every step as you climbed.&#160;
 In that little chamber, she is now watching to leave
it as soon as ever she may.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She cannot know anything about
the door!&#8212;&#173;she cannot at least know how
to open it!&#8221; I said; but my heart was not so
confident as my words.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Hush, hush!&#8221; whispered
the librarian, with uplifted hand; &#8220;she can
hear through anything!&#8212;&#173;You must go at once,
and make your way to my wife&#8217;s cottage.&#160;
 I will remain to keep guard over her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go to the Little Ones!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beware of that, Mr. Vane.&#160;  Go to my wife,
and do as she tells you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">His advice did not recommend itself:&#160;
why haste to encounter measureless delay?&#160;  If
not to protect the children, why go at all?&#160; Alas,
even now I believed him only enough to ask him questions,
not to obey him!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tell me first, Mr. Raven,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;why, of all places, you have shut her
up there!&#160;  The night I ran from your house, it
was immediately into that closet!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The closet is no nearer our
cottage, and no farther from it, than any or every
other place.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But,&#8221; I returned, hard
to persuade where I could not understand, &#8220;how
is it then that, when you please, you take from that
same door a whole book where I saw and felt only a
part of one?&#160;  The other part, you have just told
me, stuck through into your library:&#160; when you
put it again on the shelf, will it not again stick
through into that?&#160;  Must not then the two places,
in which parts of the same volume can at the same
moment exist, lie close together?&#160;  Or can one
part of the book be in space, or <i>somewhere</i>, and
the other out of space, or <i>nowhere</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am sorry I cannot explain
the thing to you,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;but there
is no provision in you for understanding it.&#160; 
Not merely, therefore, is the phenomenon inexplicable
to you, but the very nature of it is inapprehensible
by you.&#160;  Indeed I but partially apprehend it
myself.&#160;  At the same time you are constantly experiencing
things which you not only do not, but cannot understand.&#160;
 You think you understand them, but your understanding
of them is only your being used to them, and therefore
not surprised at them.&#160;  You accept them, not
because you understand them, but because you must accept
them:&#160; they are there, and have unavoidable relations
with you!&#160;  The fact is, no man understands anything;
when he knows he does not understand, that is his
first tottering step&#8212;&#173;not toward understanding,
but toward the capability of one day understanding.&#160;
 To such things as these you are not used, therefore
you do not fancy you understand them.&#160;  Neither
I nor any man can here help you to understand; but
I may, perhaps, help you a little to believe!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He went to the door of the closet,
gave a low whistle, and stood listening.&#160;  A moment
after, I heard, or seemed to hear, a soft whir of
wings, and, looking up, saw a white dove perch for
an instant on the top of the shelves over the portrait,
thence drop to Mr. Raven&#8217;s shoulder, and lay
her head against his cheek.&#160;  Only by the motions
of their two heads could I tell that they were talking
together; I heard nothing.&#160;  Neither had I moved
my eyes from them, when suddenly she was not there,
and Mr. Raven came back to his seat.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why did you whistle?&#8221;
I asked.&#160;  &#8220;Surely sound here is not sound
there!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he answered.&#160;
 &#8220;I whistled that you might know I called her.&#160;
 Not the whistle, but what the whistle meant reached
her.&#8212;&#173;There is not a minute to lose:&#160;
you must go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will at once!&#8221; I replied, and moved
for the door.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You will sleep to-night at
my hostelry!&#8221; he said&#8212;&#173;not as a question,
but in a tone of mild authority.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My heart is with the children,&#8221;
I replied.&#160;  &#8220;But if you insist&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do insist.&#160;  You can
otherwise effect nothing.&#8212;&#173;I will go with
you as far as the mirror, and see you off.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He rose.&#160;  There came a sudden
shock in the closet.&#160;  Apparently the leopardess
had flung herself against the heavy door.&#160;  I looked
at my companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come; come!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p align="justify">Ere we reached the door of the library,
a howling yell came after us, mingled with the noise
of claws that scored at the hard oak.&#160; I hesitated,
and half turned.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;To think of her lying there
alone,&#8221; I murmured, &#8220;&#8212;&#173;with that
terrible wound!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nothing will ever close that
wound,&#8221; he answered, with a sigh.&#160; &#8220;It
must eat into her heart!&#160;  Annihilation itself
is no death to evil.&#160;  Only good where evil was,
is evil dead.&#160;  An evil thing must live with its
evil until it chooses to be good.&#160;  That alone
is the slaying of evil.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I held my peace until a sound I did
not understand overtook us.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she should break loose!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Make haste!&#8221; he rejoined.&#160;
 &#8220;I shall hurry down the moment you are gone,
and I have disarranged the mirrors.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We ran, and reached the wooden chamber
breathless.&#160;  Mr. Raven seized the chains and
adjusted the hood.&#160;  Then he set the mirrors in
their proper relation, and came beside me in front
of the standing one.&#160; Already I saw the mountain
range emerging from the mist.</p>

<p align="justify">Between us, wedging us asunder, darted,
with the yell of a demon, the huge bulk of the spotted
leopardess.&#160;  She leaped through the mirror as
through an open window, and settled at once into a
low, even, swift gallop.</p>

<p align="justify">I cast a look of dismay at my companion,
and sprang through to follow her.&#160;  He came after
me leisurely.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You need not run,&#8221; he
called; &#8220;you cannot overtake her.&#160;  This
is our way.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he turned in the opposite direction.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She has more magic at her finger-tips
than I care to know!&#8221; he added quietly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We must do what we can!&#8221;
I said, and ran on, but sickening as I saw her dwindle
in the distance, stopped, and went back to him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Doubtless we must,&#8221; he
answered.&#160;  &#8220;But my wife has warned Mara,
and she will do her part; you must sleep first:&#160;
you have given me your word!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nor do I mean to break it.&#160;
 But surely sleep is not the first thing!&#160; Surely,
surely, action takes precedence of repose!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A man can do nothing he is
not fit to do.&#8212;&#173;See! did I not tell you
Mara would do her part?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I looked whither he pointed, and saw
a white spot moving at an acute angle with the line
taken by the leopardess.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There she is!&#8221; he cried.&#160;
 &#8220;The spotted leopardess is strong, but the
white is stronger!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have seen them fight:&#160;
the combat did not appear decisive as to that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How should such eyes tell which
have never slept?&#160;  The princess did not confess
herself beaten&#8212;&#173;that she never does&#8212;&#173;but
she fled!&#160;  When she confesses her last hope gone,
that it is indeed hard to kick against the goad, then
will her day begin to dawn!&#160;  Come; come!&#160;
 He who cannot act must make haste to sleep!&#8221;</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXI</h1>

<p><b>THE SEXTON&#8217;S OLD HORSE</b></p>

<p align="justify">I stood and watched the last gleam
of the white leopardess melt away, then turned to
follow my guide&#8212;&#173;but reluctantly.&#160;  What
had I to do with sleep?&#160;  Surely reason was the
same in every world, and what reason could there be
in going to sleep with the dead, when the hour was
calling the live man?&#160;  Besides, no one would wake
me, and how could I be certain of waking early&#8212;&#173;of
waking at all?&#8212;&#173;the sleepers in that house
let morning glide into noon, and noon into night, nor
ever stirred!&#160;  I murmured, but followed, for I
knew not what else to do.</p>

<p align="justify">The librarian walked on in silence,
and I walked silent as he.&#160;  Time and space glided
past us.&#160;  The sun set; it began to grow dark,
and I felt in the air the spreading cold of the chamber
of death.&#160;  My heart sank lower and lower.&#160;
 I began to lose sight of the lean, long-coated figure,
and at length could no more hear his swishing stride
through the heather.&#160;  But then I heard instead
the slow-flapping wings of the raven; and, at intervals,
now a firefly, now a gleaming butterfly rose into
the rayless air.</p>

<p align="justify">By and by the moon appeared, slow
crossing the far horizon.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are tired, are you not,
Mr. Vane?&#8221; said the raven, alighting on a stone.&#160;
 &#8220;You must make acquaintance with the horse that
will carry you in the morning!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He gave a strange whistle through
his long black beak.&#160;  A spot appeared on the
face of the half-risen moon.&#160;  To my ears came
presently the drumming of swift, soft-galloping hoofs,
and in a minute or two, out of the very disc of the
moon, low-thundered the terrible horse.&#160;  His
mane flowed away behind him like the crest of a wind-fighting
wave, torn seaward in hoary spray, and the whisk of
his tail kept blinding the eye of the moon.&#160;  Nineteen
hands he seemed, huge of bone, tight of skin, hard
of muscle&#8212;&#173;a steed the holy Death himself
might choose on which to ride abroad and slay!&#160;
The moon seemed to regard him with awe; in her scary
light he looked a very skeleton, loosely roped together.&#160;
 Terrifically large, he moved with the lightness of
a winged insect.&#160;  As he drew near, his speed
slackened, and his mane and tail drifted about him
settling.</p>

<p align="justify">Now I was not merely a lover of horses,
but I loved every horse I saw.&#160;  I had never spent
money except upon horses, and had never sold a horse.&#160;
 The sight of this mighty one, terrible to look at,
woke in me longing to possess him.&#160;  It was pure
greed, nay, rank covetousness, an evil thing in all
the worlds.&#160;  I do not mean that I could have
stolen him, but that, regardless of his proper place,
I would have bought him if I could.&#160;  I laid my
hands on him, and stroked the protuberant bones that
humped a hide smooth and thin, and shiny as satin&#8212;&#173;so
shiny that the very shape of the moon was reflected
in it; I fondled his sharp-pointed ears, whispered
words in them, and breathed into his red nostrils
the breath of a man&#8217;s life.&#160;  He in return
breathed into mine the breath of a horse&#8217;s life,
and we loved one another.&#160;  What eyes he had!&#160;
 Blue-filmy like the eyes of the dead, behind each
was a glowing coal!&#160;  The raven, with wings half
extended, looked on pleased at my love-making to his
magnificent horse.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is well! be friends with
him,&#8221; he said:&#160; &#8220;he will carry you
all the better to-morrow!&#8212;&#173;Now we must hurry
home!&#8221;</p>

<p>My desire to ride the horse had grown passionate.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I not mount him at once, Mr. Raven?&#8221;
I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means!&#8221; he answered.&#160;  &#8220;Mount,
and ride him home.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The horse bent his head over my shoulder
lovingly.&#160;  I twisted my hands in his mane and
scrambled onto his back, not without aid from certain
protuberant bones.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would outspeed any leopard in creation!&#8221;
I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not that way at night,&#8221;
answered the raven; &#8220;the road is difficult.&#8212;&#173;
But come; loss now will be gain then!&#160;  To wait
is harder than to run, and its meed is the fuller.&#160;
 Go on, my son&#8212;&#173;straight to the cottage.&#160;
 I shall be there as soon as you.&#160;  It will rejoice
my wife&#8217;s heart to see son of hers on that horse!&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat silent.&#160;  The horse stood like a block of
marble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you linger?&#8221; asked the raven.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I long so much to ride after
the leopardess,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;that I can
scarce restrain myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have promised!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My debt to the Little Ones
appears, I confess, a greater thing than my bond to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yield to the temptation and
you will bring mischief upon them&#8212;&#173;and on
yourself also.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What matters it for me?&#160;
 I love them; and love works no evil.&#160;  I will
go.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But the truth was, I forgot the children,
infatuate with the horse.</p>

<p align="justify">Eyes flashed through the darkness,
and I knew that Adam stood in his own shape beside
me.&#160;  I knew also by his voice that he repressed
an indignation almost too strong for him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mr. Vane,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do
you not know why you have not yet done anything worth
doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I have been a fool,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wherein?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which do you count your most indiscreet action?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Bringing the princess to life:&#160;
I ought to have left her to her just fate.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nay, now you talk foolishly!&#160;
 You could not have done otherwise than you did, not
knowing she was evil!&#8212;&#173;But you never brought
any one to life!&#160;  How could you, yourself dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dead?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;and
you will be dead, so long as you refuse to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to the old riddling!&#8221; I returned
scornfully.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Be persuaded, and go home with
me,&#8221; he continued gently.&#160;  &#8220;The most&#8212;&#173;nearly
the only foolish thing you ever did, was to run from
our dead.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I pressed the horse&#8217;s ribs,
and he was off like a sudden wind.&#160;  I gave him
a pat on the side of the neck, and he went about in
a sharp-driven curve, &#8220;close to the ground,
like a cat when scratchingly she wheels about after
a mouse,&#8221; leaning sideways till his mane swept
the tops of the heather.</p>

<p align="justify">Through the dark I heard the wings
of the raven.&#160;  Five quick flaps I heard, and
he perched on the horse&#8217;s head.&#160;  The horse
checked himself instantly, ploughing up the ground
with his feet.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mr. Vane,&#8221; croaked the
raven, &#8220;think what you are doing!&#160;  Twice
already has evil befallen you&#8212;&#173;once from
fear, and once from heedlessness:&#160; breach of word
is far worse; it is a crime.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The Little Ones are in frightful
peril, and I brought it upon them!&#8221; I cried.
 &#8220;&#8212;&#173;But indeed I will not break my
word to you.&#160;  I will return, and spend in your
house what nights&#8212;&#173;what days&#8212;&#173;what
years you please.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I tell you once more you will
do them other than good if you go to-night,&#8221;
he insisted.</p>

<p align="justify">But a false sense of power, a sense
which had no root and was merely vibrated into me
from the strength of the horse, had, alas, rendered
me too stupid to listen to anything he said!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Would you take from me my last
chance of reparation?&#8221; I cried.&#160; &#8220;This
time there shall be no shirking!&#160;  It is my duty,
and I will go&#8212;&#173;if I perish for it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Go, then, foolish boy!&#8221;
he returned, with anger in his croak.&#160;  &#8220;Take
the horse, and ride to failure!&#160;  May it be to
humility!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He spread his wings and flew.&#160;
 Again I pressed the lean ribs under me.</p>

<p>&#8220;After the spotted leopardess!&#8221; I whispered
in his ear.</p>

<p align="justify">He turned his head this way and that,
snuffing the air; then started, and went a few paces
in a slow, undecided walk.&#160;  Suddenly he quickened
his walk; broke into a trot; began to gallop, and in
a few moments his speed was tremendous.&#160;  He seemed
to see in the dark; never stumbled, not once faltered,
not once hesitated.&#160;  I sat as on the ridge of
a wave.&#160;  I felt under me the play of each individual
muscle:&#160; his joints were so elastic, and his every
movement glided so into the next, that not once did
he jar me.&#160;  His growing swiftness bore him along
until he flew rather than ran.&#160; The wind met and
passed us like a tornado.</p>

<p align="justify">Across the evil hollow we sped like
a bolt from an arblast.&#160;  No monster lifted its
neck; all knew the hoofs that thundered over their
heads!&#160;  We rushed up the hills, we shot down their
farther slopes; from the rocky chasms of the river-bed
he did not swerve; he held on over them his fierce,
terrible gallop.&#160;  The moon, half-way up the heaven,
gazed with a solemn trouble in her pale countenance.&#160;
Rejoicing in the power of my steed and in the pride
of my life, I sat like a king and rode.</p>

<p align="justify">We were near the middle of the many
channels, my horse every other moment clearing one,
sometimes two in his stride, and now and then gathering
himself for a great bounding leap, when the moon reached
the key-stone of her arch.&#160;  Then came a wonder
and a terror:&#160; she began to descend rolling like
the nave of Fortune&#8217;s wheel bowled by the gods,
and went faster and faster.&#160;  Like our own moon,
this one had a human face, and now the broad forehead
now the chin was uppermost as she rolled.&#160;  I
gazed aghast.</p>

<p align="justify">Across the ravines came the howling
of wolves.&#160;  An ugly fear began to invade the
hollow places of my heart; my confidence was on the
wane!&#160;  The horse maintained his headlong swiftness,
with ears pricked forward, and thirsty nostrils exulting
in the wind his career created.&#160;  But there was
the moon jolting like an old chariot-wheel down the
hill of heaven, with awful boding!&#160;  She rolled
at last over the horizon-edge and disappeared, carrying
all her light with her.</p>

<p align="justify">The mighty steed was in the act of
clearing a wide shallow channel when we were caught
in the net of the darkness.&#160;  His head dropped;
its impetus carried his helpless bulk across, but he
fell in a heap on the margin, and where he fell he
lay.&#160;  I got up, kneeled beside him, and felt
him all over.&#160;  Not a bone could I find broken,
but he was a horse no more.&#160;  I sat down on the
body, and buried my face in my hands.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXII</h1>

<p><b>THE LOVERS AND THE BAGS</b></p>

<p align="justify">Bitterly cold grew the night.&#160;
 The body froze under me.&#160;  The cry of the wolves
came nearer; I heard their feet soft-padding on the
rocky ground; their quick panting filled the air.&#160;
 Through the darkness I saw the many glowing eyes;
their half-circle contracted around me.&#160;  My time
was come!&#160;  I sprang to my feet.&#8212;&#173;Alas,
I had not even a stick!</p>

<p align="justify">They came in a rush, their eyes flashing
with fury of greed, their black throats agape to devour
me.&#160;  I stood hopelessly waiting them.&#160; One
moment they halted over the horse&#8212;&#173;then came
at me.</p>

<p align="justify">With a sound of swiftness all but
silence, a cloud of green eyes came down on their
flank.&#160;  The heads that bore them flew at the
wolves with a cry feebler yet fiercer than their howling
snarl, and by the cry I knew them:&#160; they were
cats, led by a huge gray one.&#160;  I could see nothing
of him but his eyes, yet I knew him&#8212;&#173;and
so knew his colour and bigness.&#160;  A terrific battle
followed, whose tale alone came to me through the
night.&#160;  I would have fled, for surely it was
but a fight which should have me!&#8212;&#173;only where
was the use? my first step would be a fall! and my
foes of either kind could both see and scent me in
the dark!</p>

<p align="justify">All at once I missed the howling,
and the caterwauling grew wilder.&#160; Then came the
soft padding, and I knew it meant flight:&#160; the
cats had defeated the wolves!&#160;  In a moment the
sharpest of sharp teeth were in my legs; a moment
more and the cats were all over me in a live cataract,
biting wherever they could bite, furiously scratching
me anywhere and everywhere.&#160;  A multitude clung
to my body; I could not flee.&#160;  Madly I fell on
the hateful swarm, every finger instinct with destruction.&#160;
 I tore them off me, I throttled at them in vain:&#160;
when I would have flung them from me, they clung to
my hands like limpets.&#160;  I trampled them under
my feet, thrust my fingers in their eyes, caught them
in jaws stronger than theirs, but could not rid myself
of one.&#160;  Without cease they kept discovering upon
me space for fresh mouthfuls; they hauled at my skin
with the widespread, horribly curved pincers of clutching
claws; they hissed and spat in my face&#8212;&#173;but
never touched it until, in my despair, I threw myself
on the ground, when they forsook my body, and darted
at my face.&#160; I rose, and immediately they left
it, the more to occupy themselves with my legs.&#160;
 In an agony I broke from them and ran, careless whither,
cleaving the solid dark.&#160;  They accompanied me
in a surrounding torrent, now rubbing, now leaping
up against me, but tormenting me no more.&#160;  When
I fell, which was often, they gave me time to rise;
when from fear of falling I slackened my pace, they
flew afresh at my legs.&#160;  All that miserable night
they kept me running&#8212;&#173;but they drove me
by a comparatively smooth path, for I tumbled into
no gully, and passing the Evil Wood without seeing
it, left it behind in the dark.&#160;  When at length
the morning appeared, I was beyond the channels, and
on the verge of the orchard valley.&#160; In my joy
I would have made friends with my persecutors, but
not a cat was to be seen.&#160;  I threw myself on
the moss, and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p align="justify">I was waked by a kick, to find myself
bound hand and foot, once more the thrall of the giants!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What fitter?&#8221; I said
to myself; &#8220;to whom else should I belong?&#8221;
and I laughed in the triumph of self-disgust.&#160;
 A second kick stopped my false merriment; and thus
recurrently assisted by my captors, I succeeded at
length in rising to my feet.</p>

<p align="justify">Six of them were about me.&#160;  They
undid the rope that tied my legs together, attached
a rope to each of them, and dragged me away.&#160; 
I walked as well as I could, but, as they frequently
pulled both ropes at once, I fell repeatedly, whereupon
they always kicked me up again.&#160; Straight to my
old labour they took me, tied my leg-ropes to a tree,
undid my arms, and put the hateful flint in my left
hand.&#160;  Then they lay down and pelted me with
fallen fruit and stones, but seldom hit me.&#160; 
If I could have freed my legs, and got hold of a stick
I spied a couple of yards from me, I would have fallen
upon all six of them!&#160;  &#8220;But the Little
Ones will come at night!&#8221; I said to myself,
and was comforted.</p>

<p align="justify">All day I worked hard.&#160;  When
the darkness came, they tied my hands, and left me
fast to the tree.&#160;  I slept a good deal, but woke
often, and every time from a dream of lying in the
heart of a heap of children.&#160;  With the morning
my enemies reappeared, bringing their kicks and their
bestial company.</p>

<p align="justify">It was about noon, and I was nearly
failing from fatigue and hunger, when I heard a sudden
commotion in the brushwood, followed by a burst of
the bell-like laughter so dear to my heart.&#160;  I
gave a loud cry of delight and welcome.&#160;  Immediately
rose a trumpeting as of baby-elephants, a neighing
as of foals, and a bellowing as of calves, and through
the bushes came a crowd of Little Ones, on diminutive
horses, on small elephants, on little bears; but the
noises came from the riders, not the animals.&#160;
 Mingled with the mounted ones walked the bigger of
the boys and girls, among the latter a woman with
a baby crowing in her arms.&#160;  The giants sprang
to their lumbering feet, but were instantly saluted
with a storm of sharp stones; the horses charged their
legs; the bears rose and hugged them at the waist;
the elephants threw their trunks round their necks,
pulled them down, and gave them such a trampling as
they had sometimes given, but never received before.&#160;
 In a moment my ropes were undone, and I was in the
arms, seemingly innumerable, of the Little Ones.&#160;
For some time I saw no more of the giants.</p>

<p align="justify">They made me sit down, and my Lona
came, and without a word began to feed me with the
loveliest red and yellow fruits.&#160;  I sat and ate,
the whole colony mounting guard until I had done.&#160;
 Then they brought up two of the largest of their
elephants, and having placed them side by side, hooked
their trunks and tied their tails together.&#160; The
docile creatures could have untied their tails with
a single shake, and unhooked their trunks by forgetting
them; but tails and trunks remained as their little
masters had arranged them, and it was clear the elephants
understood that they must keep their bodies parallel.&#160;
 I got up, and laid myself in the hollow between their
two backs; when the wise animals, counteracting the
weight that pushed them apart, leaned against each
other, and made for me a most comfortable litter.&#160;
 My feet, it is true, projected beyond their tails,
but my head lay pillowed on an ear of each.&#160;  Then
some of the smaller children, mounting for a bodyguard,
ranged themselves in a row along the back of each
of my bearers; the whole assembly formed itself in
train; and the procession began to move.</p>

<p align="justify">Whither they were carrying me, I did
not try to conjecture; I yielded myself to their pleasure,
almost as happy as they.&#160;  Chattering and laughing
and playing glad tricks innumerable at first, the moment
they saw I was going to sleep, they became still as
judges.</p>

<p align="justify">I woke:&#160; a sudden musical uproar
greeted the opening of my eyes.</p>

<p align="justify">We were travelling through the forest
in which they found the babies, and which, as I had
suspected, stretched all the way from the valley to
the hot stream.</p>

<p align="justify">A tiny girl sat with her little feet
close to my face, and looked down at me coaxingly
for a while, then spoke, the rest seeming to hang
on her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;We make a petisson to king,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, my darling?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sut eyes one minute,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I will!&#160;  Here goes!&#8221; I
replied, and shut my eyes close.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! not fore I tell oo!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p align="justify">I opened them again, and we talked
and laughed together for quite another hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Close eyes!&#8221; she said suddenly.</p>

<p align="justify">I closed my eyes, and kept them close.&#160;
 The elephants stood still.&#160; I heard a soft scurry,
a little rustle, and then a silence&#8212;&#173;for
in that world <i>some</i> silences <i>are</i> heard.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Open eyes!&#8221; twenty voices
a little way off shouted at once; but when I obeyed,
not a creature was visible except the elephants that
bore me.&#160;  I knew the children marvellously quick
in getting out of the way&#8212;&#173;the giants had
taught them that; but when I raised myself, and looking
about in the open shrubless forest, could descry neither
hand nor heel, I stared in &#8220;blank astonishment.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The sun was set, and it was fast getting
dark, yet presently a multitude of birds began to
sing.&#160;  I lay down to listen, pretty sure that,
if I left them alone, the hiders would soon come out
again.</p>

<p align="justify">The singing grew to a little storm
of bird-voices.&#160;  &#8220;Surely the children must
have something to do with it!&#8212;&#173;And yet how
could they set the birds singing?&#8221; I said to
myself as I lay and listened.&#160; Soon, however,
happening to look up into the tree under which my
elephants stood, I thought I spied a little motion
among the leaves, and looked more keenly.&#160;  Sudden
white spots appeared in the dark foliage, the music
died down, a gale of childish laughter rippled the
air, and white spots came out in every direction:&#160;
the trees were full of children!&#160;  In the wildest
merriment they began to descend, some dropping from
bough to bough so rapidly that I could scarce believe
they had not fallen.&#160;  I left my litter, and was
instantly surrounded&#8212;&#173;a mark for all the
artillery of their jubilant fun.&#160; With stately
composure the elephants walked away to bed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But,&#8221; said I, when their
uproarious gladness had had scope for a while, &#8220;how
is it that I never before heard you sing like the birds?&#160;
Even when I thought it must be you, I could hardly
believe it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said one of the
wildest, &#8220;but we were not birds then!&#160;  We
were run-creatures, not fly-creatures!&#160;  We had
our hide-places in the bushes then; but when we came
to no-bushes, only trees, we had to build nests!&#160;
 When we built nests, we grew birds, and when we were
birds, we had to do birds!&#160;  We asked them to teach
us their noises, and they taught us, and now we are
real birds!&#8212;&#173;Come and see my nest.&#160;
 It&#8217;s not big enough for king, but it&#8217;s
big enough for king to see me in it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I told him I could not get up a tree
without the sun to show me the way; when he came,
I would try.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kings seldom have wings!&#8221; I added.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;King! king!&#8221; cried one,
&#8220;oo knows none of us hasn&#8217;t no wings&#8212;&#173;foolis
feddery tings!&#160;  Arms and legs is better.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is true.&#160;  I can get
up without wings&#8212;&#173;and carry straws in my
mouth too, to build my nest with!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oo knows!&#8221; he answered,
and went away sucking his thumb.</p>

<p align="justify">A moment after, I heard him calling
out of his nest, a great way up a walnut tree of enormous
size,</p>

<p>&#8220;Up adain, king!&#160;  Dood night!&#160;  I seepy!&#8221;</p>

<p>And I heard no more of him till he woke me in the
morning.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXIII</h1>

<p><b>LONA&#8217;S NARRATIVE</b></p>

<p align="justify">I lay down by a tree, and one and
one or in little groups, the children left me and
climbed to their nests.&#160;  They were always so
tired at night and so rested in the morning, that they
were equally glad to go to sleep and to get up again.&#160;
 I, although tired also, lay awake:&#160; Lona had
not bid me good night, and I was sure she would come.</p>

<p align="justify">I had been struck, the moment I saw
her again, with her resemblance to the princess, and
could not doubt her the daughter of whom Adam had
told me; but in Lona the dazzling beauty of Lilith
was softened by childlikeness, and deepened by the
sense of motherhood.&#160;  &#8220;She is occupied
probably,&#8221; I said to myself, &#8220;with the
child of the woman I met fleeing!&#8221; who, she
had already told me, was not half mother enough.</p>

<p align="justify">She came at length, sat down beside
me, and after a few moments of silent delight, expressed
mainly by stroking my face and hands, began to tell
me everything that had befallen since I went.&#160;
 The moon appeared as we talked, and now and then,
through the leaves, lighted for a quivering moment
her beautiful face&#8212;&#173;full of thought, and
a care whose love redeemed and glorified it.&#160; 
How such a child should have been born of such a mother&#8212;&#173;such
a woman of such a princess, was hard to understand;
but then, happily, she had two parents&#8212;&#173;say
rather, three!&#160;  She drew my heart by what in me
was likest herself, and I loved her as one who, grow
to what perfection she might, could only become the
more a child.&#160;  I knew now that I loved her when
I left her, and that the hope of seeing her again
had been my main comfort.&#160;  Every word she spoke
seemed to go straight to my heart, and, like the truth
itself, make it purer.</p>

<p align="justify">She told me that after I left the
orchard valley, the giants began to believe a little
more in the actual existence of their neighbours,
and became in consequence more hostile to them.&#160;
 Sometimes the Little Ones would see them trampling
furiously, perceiving or imagining some indication
of their presence, while they indeed stood beside,
and laughed at their foolish rage.&#160;  By and by,
however, their animosity assumed a more practical
shape:&#160; they began to destroy the trees on whose
fruit the Little Ones lived.&#160;  This drove the
mother of them all to meditate counteraction.&#160;
 Setting the sharpest of them to listen at night,
she learned that the giants thought I was hidden somewhere
near, intending, as soon as I recovered my strength,
to come in the dark and kill them sleeping.&#160; Thereupon
she concluded that the only way to stop the destruction
was to give them ground for believing that they had
abandoned the place.&#160;  The Little Ones must remove
into the forest&#8212;&#173;beyond the range of the
giants, but within reach of their own trees, which
they must visit by night!&#160;  The main objection
to the plan was, that the forest had little or no
undergrowth to shelter&#8212;&#173;or conceal them if
necessary.</p>

<p align="justify">But she reflected that where birds,
there the Little Ones could find habitation.&#160;
 They had eager sympathies with all modes of life,
and could learn of the wildest creatures:&#160; why
should they not take refuge from the cold and their
enemies in the tree-tops? why not, having lain in
the low brushwood, seek now the lofty foliage? why
not build nests where it would not serve to scoop hollows?&#160;
 All that the birds could do, the Little Ones could
learn&#8212;&#173;except, indeed, to fly!</p>

<p align="justify">She spoke to them on the subject,
and they heard with approval.&#160; They could already
climb the trees, and they had often watched the birds
building their nests!&#160;  The trees of the forest,
although large, did not look bad!&#160;  They went
up much nearer the sky than those of the giants, and
spread out their arms&#8212;&#173;some even stretched
them down&#8212;&#173;as if inviting them to come and
live with them!&#160;  Perhaps, in the top of the tallest,
they might find that bird that laid the baby-eggs,
and sat upon them till they were ripe, then tumbled
them down to let the little ones out!&#160;  Yes; they
would build sleep-houses in the trees, where no giant
would see them, for never by any chance did one throw
back his dull head to look up!&#160;  Then the bad giants
would be sure they had left the country, and the Little
Ones would gather their own apples and pears and figs
and mesples and peaches when they were asleep!</p>

<p align="justify">Thus reasoned the Lovers, and eagerly
adopted Lona&#8217;s suggestion&#8212;&#173;with the
result that they were soon as much at home in the tree-tops
as the birds themselves, and that the giants came
ere long to the conclusion that they had frightened
them out of the country&#8212;&#173;whereupon they
forgot their trees, and again almost ceased to believe
in the existence of their small neighbours.</p>

<p align="justify">Lona asked me whether I had not observed
that many of the children were grown.&#160;  I answered
I had not, but could readily believe it.&#160; She
assured me it was so, but said the certain evidence
that their minds too had grown since their migration
upward, had gone far in mitigation of the alarm the
discovery had occasioned her.</p>

<p align="justify">In the last of the short twilight,
and later when the moon was shining, they went down
to the valley, and gathered fruit enough to serve
them the next day; for the giants never went out in
the twilight:&#160; that to them was darkness; and
they hated the moon:&#160; had they been able, they
would have extinguished her.&#160;  But soon the Little
Ones found that fruit gathered in the night was not
altogether good the next day; so the question arose
whether it would not be better, instead of pretending
to have left the country, to make the bad giants themselves
leave it.</p>

<p align="justify">They had already, she said, in exploring
the forest, made acquaintance with the animals in
it, and with most of them personally.&#160;  Knowing
therefore how strong as well as wise and docile some
of them were, and how swift as well as manageable many
others, they now set themselves to secure their aid
against the giants, and with loving, playful approaches,
had soon made more than friends of most of them, from
the first addressing horse or elephant as Brother
or Sister Elephant, Brother or Sister Horse, until
before long they had an individual name for each.&#160;
 It was some little time longer before they said Brother
or Sister Bear, but that came next, and the other
day she had heard one little fellow cry, &#8220;Ah,
Sister Serpent!&#8221; to a snake that bit him as he
played with it too roughly.&#160;  Most of them would
have nothing to do with a caterpillar, except watch
it through its changes; but when at length it came
from its retirement with wings, all would immediately
address it as Sister Butterfly, congratulating it on
its metamorphosis&#8212;&#173;for which they used a
word that meant something like <i>repentance</i>&#8212;&#173;and
evidently regarding it as something sacred.</p>

<p align="justify">One moonlit evening, as they were
going to gather their fruit, they came upon a woman
seated on the ground with a baby in her lap&#8212;&#173;the
woman I had met on my way to Bulika.&#160;  They took
her for a giantess that had stolen one of their babies,
for they regarded all babies as their property.&#160;
 Filled with anger they fell upon her multitudinously,
beating her after a childish, yet sufficiently bewildering
fashion.&#160; She would have fled, but a boy threw
himself down and held her by the feet.&#160;  Recovering
her wits, she recognised in her assailants the children
whose hospitality she sought, and at once yielded the
baby.&#160;  Lona appeared, and carried it away in her
bosom.</p>

<p align="justify">But while the woman noted that in
striking her they were careful not to hurt the child,
the Little Ones noted that, as she surrendered her,
she hugged and kissed her just as they wanted to do,
and came to the conclusion that she must be a giantess
of the same kind as the good giant.&#160;  The moment
Lona had the baby, therefore, they brought the mother
fruit, and began to show her every sort of childish
attention.</p>

<p align="justify">Now the woman had been in perplexity
whither to betake herself, not daring to go back to
the city, because the princess was certain to find
out who had lamed her leopardess:&#160; delighted with
the friendliness of the little people, she resolved
to remain with them for the present:&#160; she would
have no trouble with her infant, and might find some
way of returning to her husband, who was rich in money
and gems, and very seldom unkind to her.</p>

<p align="justify">Here I must supplement, partly from
conjecture, what Lona told me about the woman.&#160;
 With the rest of the inhabitants of Bulika, she was
aware of the tradition that the princess lived in terror
of the birth of an infant destined to her destruction.&#160;
 They were all unacquainted, however, with the frightful
means by which she preserved her youth and beauty;
and her deteriorating physical condition requiring
a larger use of those means, they took the apparent
increase of her hostility to children for a sign that
she saw her doom approaching.&#160;  This, although
no one dreamed of any attempt against her, nourished
in them hopes of change.</p>

<p align="justify">Now arose in the mind of the woman
the idea of furthering the fulfilment of the shadowy
prediction, or of using the myth at least for her
own restoration to her husband.&#160;  For what seemed
more probable than that the fate foretold lay with
these very children?&#160; They were marvellously brave,
and the Bulikans cowards, in abject terror of animals!&#160;
 If she could rouse in the Little Ones the ambition
of taking the city, then in the confusion of the attack,
she would escape from the little army, reach her house
unrecognised, and there lying hidden, await the result!</p>

<p align="justify">Should the children now succeed in
expelling the giants, she would begin at once, while
they were yet flushed with victory, to suggest the
loftier aim!&#160;  By disposition, indeed, they were
unfit for warfare; they hardly ever quarrelled, and
never fought; loved every live thing, and hated either
to hurt or to suffer.&#160;  Still, they were easily
influenced, and could certainly be taught any exercise
within their strength!&#8212;&#173;At once she set some
of the smaller ones throwing stones at a mark; and
soon they were all engrossed with the new game, and
growing skilful in it.</p>

<p align="justify">The first practical result was their
use of stones in my rescue.&#160; While gathering fruit,
they found me asleep, went home, held a council, came
the next day with their elephants and horses, overwhelmed
the few giants watching me, and carried me off.&#160;
 Jubilant over their victory, the smaller boys were
childishly boastful, the bigger boys less ostentatious,
while the girls, although their eyes flashed more,
were not so talkative as usual.&#160;  The woman of
Bulika no doubt felt encouraged.</p>

<p align="justify">We talked the greater part of the
night, chiefly about the growth of the children, and
what it might indicate.&#160;  With Lona&#8217;s power
of recognising truth I had long been familiar; now
I began to be astonished at her practical wisdom.&#160;
 Probably, had I been more of a child myself, I should
have wondered less.</p>

<p align="justify">It was yet far from morning when I
became aware of a slight fluttering and scrambling.&#160;
 I rose on my elbow, and looking about me, saw many
Little Ones descend from their nests.&#160;  They disappeared,
and in a few moments all was again still.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they doing?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They think,&#8221; answered
Lona, &#8220;that, stupid as they are, the giants
will search the wood, and they are gone to gather stones
with which to receive them.&#160;  Stones are not plentiful
in the forest, and they have to scatter far to find
enow.&#160;  They will carry them to their nests, and
from the trees attack the giants as they come within
reach.&#160;  Knowing their habits, they do not expect
them before the morning.&#160;  If they do come, it
will be the opening of a war of expulsion:&#160; one
or the other people must go.&#160;  The result, however,
is hardly doubtful.&#160;  We do not mean to kill them;
indeed, their skulls are so thick that I do not think
we could!&#8212;&#173;not that killing would do them
much harm; they are so little alive!&#160;  If one were
killed, his giantess would not remember him beyond
three days!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Do the children then throw
so well that the thing <i>might</i> happen?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Wait till you see them!&#8221;
she answered, with a touch of pride. &#8220;&#8212;&#173;But
I have not yet told you,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;of
a strange thing that happened the night before last!&#8212;&#173;We
had come home from gathering our fruit, and were asleep
in our nests, when we were roused by the horrid noises
of beasts fighting.&#160;  The moon was bright, and
in a moment our trees glittered with staring little
eyes, watching two huge leopardesses, one perfectly
white, the other covered with black spots, which worried
and tore each other with I do not know how many teeth
and claws.&#160;  To judge by her back, the spotted
creature must have been climbing a tree when the other
sprang upon her.&#160;  When first I saw them, they
were just under my own tree, rolling over and over
each other.&#160;  I got down on the lowest branch,
and saw them perfectly.&#160;  The children enjoyed
the spectacle, siding some with this one, some with
that, for we had never seen such beasts before, and
thought they were only at play.&#160;  But by degrees
their roaring and growling almost ceased, and I saw
that they were in deadly earnest, and heartily wished
neither might be left able to climb a tree.&#160; 
But when the children saw the blood pouring from their
flanks and throats, what do you think they did?&#160;
 They scurried down to comfort them, and gathering
in a great crowd about the terrible creatures, began
to pat and stroke them.&#160;  Then I got down as well,
for they were much too absorbed to heed my calling
to them; but before I could reach them, the white
one stopped fighting, and sprang among them with such
a hideous yell that they flew up into the trees like
birds.&#160;  Before I got back into mine, the wicked
beasts were at it again tooth and claw.&#160;  Then
Whitey had the best of it; Spotty ran away as fast
as she could run, and Whitey came and lay down at
the foot of my tree.&#160;  But in a minute or two she
was up again, and walking about as if she thought
Spotty might be lurking somewhere.&#160; I waked often,
and every time I looked out, I saw her.&#160;  In the
morning she went away.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I know both the beasts,&#8221;
I said.&#160;  &#8220;Spotty is a bad beast.&#160;  She
hates the children, and would kill every one of them.&#160;
 But Whitey loves them.&#160;  She ran at them only
to frighten them away, lest Spotty should get hold
of any of them.&#160;  No one needs be afraid of Whitey!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">By this time the Little Ones were
coming back, and with much noise, for they had no
care to keep quiet now that they were at open war
with the giants, and laden with good stones.&#160; 
They mounted to their nests again, though with difficulty
because of their burdens, and in a minute were fast
asleep.&#160;  Lona retired to her tree.&#160;  I lay
where I was, and slept the better that I thought most
likely the white leopardess was still somewhere in
the wood.</p>

<p align="justify">I woke soon after the sun, and lay
pondering.&#160;  Two hours passed, and then in truth
the giants began to appear, in straggling companies
of three and four, until I counted over a hundred
of them.&#160;  The children were still asleep, and
to call them would draw the attention of the giants:&#160;
I would keep quiet so long as they did not discover
me.&#160; But by and by one came blundering upon me,
stumbled, fell, and rose again.&#160;  I thought he
would pass heedless, but he began to search about.&#160;
 I sprang to my feet, and struck him in the middle
of his huge body.&#160;  The roar he gave roused the
children, and a storm as of hail instantly came on,
of which not a stone struck me, and not one missed
the giant.&#160;  He fell and lay.&#160;  Others drew
near, and the storm extended, each purblind creature
becoming, as he entered the range of a garrisoned
tree, a target for converging stones.&#160;  In a short
time almost every giant was prostrate, and a jubilant
p&#230;an of bird-song rose from the tops of fifty trees.</p>

<p align="justify">Many elephants came hurrying up, and
the children descending the trees like monkeys, in
a moment every elephant had three or four of them
on his back, and thus loaded, began to walk over the
giants, who lay and roared.&#160;  Losing patience
at length with their noise, the elephants gave them
a few blows of their trunks, and left them.</p>

<p align="justify">Until night the bad giants remained
where they had fallen, silent and motionless.&#160;
 The next morning they had disappeared every one,
and the children saw no more of them.&#160;  They removed
to the other end of the orchard valley, and never
after ventured into the forest.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXIV</h1>

<p><b>PREPARATION</b></p>

<p align="justify">Victory thus gained, the woman of
Bulika began to speak about the city, and talked much
of its defenceless condition, of the wickedness of
its princess, of the cowardice of its inhabitants.&#160;
 In a few days the children chattered of nothing but
Bulika, although indeed they had not the least notion
of what a city was.&#160;  Then first I became aware
of the design of the woman, although not yet of its
motive.</p>

<p align="justify">The idea of taking possession of the
place, recommended itself greatly to Lona&#8212;&#173;and
to me also.&#160;  The children were now so rapidly
developing faculty, that I could see no serious obstacle
to the success of the enterprise.&#160;  For the terrible
Lilith&#8212;&#173;woman or leopardess, I knew her
one vulnerable point, her doom through her daughter,
and the influence the ancient prophecy had upon the
citizens:&#160; surely whatever in the enterprise could
be called risk, was worth taking!&#160;  Successful,&#8212;&#173;and
who could doubt their success?&#8212;&#173;must not
the Little Ones, from a crowd of children, speedily
become a youthful people, whose government and influence
would be all for righteousness?&#160;  Ruling the wicked
with a rod of iron, would they not be the redemption
of the nation?</p>

<p align="justify">At the same time, I have to confess
that I was not without views of personal advantage,
not without ambition in the undertaking.&#160;  It
was just, it seemed to me, that Lona should take her
seat on the throne that had been her mother&#8217;s,
and natural that she should make of me her consort
and minister.&#160;  For me, I would spend my life in
her service; and between us, what might we not do,
with such a core to it as the Little Ones, for the
development of a noble state?</p>

<p align="justify">I confess also to an altogether foolish
dream of opening a commerce in gems between the two
worlds&#8212;&#173;happily impossible, for it could
have done nothing but harm to both.</p>

<p align="justify">Calling to mind the appeal of Adam,
I suggested to Lona that to find them water might
perhaps expedite the growth of the Little Ones.&#160;
 She judged it prudent, however, to leave that alone
for the present, as we did not know what its first
consequences might be; while, in the course of time,
it would almost certainly subject them to a new necessity.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They are what they are without
it!&#8221; she said:&#160; &#8220;when we have the
city, we will search for water!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We began, therefore, and pushed forward
our preparations, constantly reviewing the merry troops
and companies.&#160;  Lona gave her attention chiefly
to the commissariat, while I drilled the little soldiers,
exercised them in stone-throwing, taught them the use
of some other weapons, and did all I could to make
warriors of them.&#160;  The main difficulty was to
get them to rally to their flag the instant the call
was sounded.&#160;  Most of them were armed with slings,
some of the bigger boys with bows and arrows.&#160;
 The bigger girls carried aloe-spikes, strong as steel
and sharp as needles, fitted to longish shafts&#8212;&#173;rather
formidable weapons.&#160;  Their sole duty was the charge
of such as were too small to fight.</p>

<p align="justify">Lona had herself grown a good deal,
but did not seem aware of it:&#160; she had always
been, as she still was, the tallest!&#160;  Her hair
was much longer, and she was become almost a woman,
but not one beauty of childhood had she outgrown.&#160;
 When first we met after our long separation, she
laid down her infant, put her arms round my neck,
and clung to me silent, her face glowing with gladness:&#160;
the child whimpered; she sprang to him, and had him
in her bosom instantly.&#160; To see her with any thoughtless,
obstinate, or irritable little one, was to think of
a tender grandmother.&#160;  I seemed to have known
her for ages&#8212;&#173;for always&#8212;&#173;from
before time began!&#160;  I hardly remembered my mother,
but in my mind&#8217;s eye she now looked like Lona;
and if I imagined sister or child, invariably she
had the face of Lona!&#160;  My every imagination flew
to her; she was my heart&#8217;s wife!&#160;  She hardly
ever sought me, but was almost always within sound
of my voice.&#160;  What I did or thought, I referred
constantly to her, and rejoiced to believe that, while
doing her work in absolute independence, she was most
at home by my side.&#160;  Never for me did she neglect
the smallest child, and my love only quickened my
sense of duty.&#160;  To love her and to do my duty,
seemed, not indeed one, but inseparable.&#160; She
might suggest something I should do; she might ask
me what she ought to do; but she never seemed to suppose
that I, any more than she, would like to do, or could
care about anything except what must be done.&#160;
 Her love overflowed upon me&#8212;&#173;not in caresses,
but in a closeness of recognition which I can compare
to nothing but the devotion of a divine animal.</p>

<p>I never told her anything about her mother.</p>

<p align="justify">The wood was full of birds, the splendour
of whose plumage, while it took nothing from their
song, seemed almost to make up for the lack of flowers&#8212;&#173;which,
apparently, could not grow without water.&#160; Their
glorious feathers being everywhere about in the forest,
it came into my heart to make from them a garment
for Lona.&#160;  While I gathered, and bound them in
overlapping rows, she watched me with evident appreciation
of my choice and arrangement, never asking what I
was fashioning, but evidently waiting expectant the
result of my work.&#160;  In a week or two it was finished&#8212;&#173;a
long loose mantle, to fasten at the throat and waist,
with openings for the arms.</p>

<p align="justify">I rose and put it on her.&#160;  She
rose, took it off, and laid it at my feet&#8212;&#173;I
imagine from a sense of propriety.&#160;  I put it again
on her shoulders, and showed her where to put her
arms through.&#160;  She smiled, looked at the feathers
a little and stroked them&#8212;&#173;again took it
off and laid it down, this time by her side.&#160; 
When she left me, she carried it with her, and I saw
no more of it for some days.&#160; At length she came
to me one morning wearing it, and carrying another
garment which she had fashioned similarly, but of the
dried leaves of a tough evergreen.&#160;  It had the
strength almost of leather, and the appearance of
scale-armour.&#160;  I put it on at once, and we always
thereafter wore those garments when on horseback.</p>

<p align="justify">For, on the outskirts of the forest,
had appeared one day a troop of full-grown horses,
with which, as they were nowise alarmed at creatures
of a shape so different from their own, I had soon
made friends, and two of the finest I had trained
for Lona and myself.&#160; Already accustomed to ride
a small one, her delight was great when first she
looked down from the back of an animal of the giant
kind; and the horse showed himself proud of the burden
he bore.&#160;  We exercised them every day until they
had such confidence in us as to obey instantly and
fear nothing; after which we always rode them at parade
and on the march.</p>

<p align="justify">The undertaking did indeed at times
appear to me a foolhardy one, but the confidence of
the woman of Bulika, real or simulated, always overcame
my hesitancy.&#160;  The princess&#8217;s magic, she
insisted, would prove powerless against the children;
and as to any force she might muster, our animal-allies
alone would assure our superiority:&#160; she was herself,
she said, ready, with a good stick, to encounter any
two men of Bulika.&#160;  She confessed to not a little
fear of the leopardess, but I was myself ready for
her.&#160;  I shrank, however, from carrying <i>all</i>
the children with us.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Would it not be better,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;that you remained in the forest with
your baby and the smallest of the Little Ones?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She answered that she greatly relied
on the impression the sight of them would make on
the women, especially the mothers.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;When they see the darlings,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;their hearts will be taken by storm;
and I must be there encouraging them to make a stand!&#160;
 If there be a remnant of hardihood in the place,
it will be found among the women!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;<i>You</i> must not encumber
yourself,&#8221; I said to Lona, &#8220;with any of
the children; you will be wanted everywhere!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">For there were two babies besides
the woman&#8217;s, and even on horseback she had almost
always one in her arms.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not remember ever being
without a child to take care of,&#8221; she answered;
&#8220;but when we reach the city, it shall be as you
wish!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Her confidence in one who had failed
so unworthily, shamed me.&#160;  But neither had I
initiated the movement, nor had I any ground for opposing
it; I had no choice, but must give it the best help
I could!&#160;  For myself, I was ready to live or
die with Lona.&#160;  Her humility as well as her trust
humbled me, and I gave myself heartily to her purposes.</p>

<p align="justify">Our way lying across a grassy plain,
there was no need to take food for the horses, or
the two cows which would accompany us for the infants;
but the elephants had to be provided for.&#160;  True,
the grass was as good for them as for those other
animals, but it was short, and with their one-fingered
long noses, they could not pick enough for a single
meal.&#160;  We had, therefore, set the whole colony
to gather grass and make hay, of which the elephants
themselves could carry a quantity sufficient to last
them several days, with the supplement of what we
would gather fresh every time we halted.&#160;  For
the bears we stored nuts, and for ourselves dried plenty
of fruits.&#160; We had caught and tamed several more
of the big horses, and now having loaded them and
the elephants with these provisions, we were prepared
to set out.</p>

<p align="justify">Then Lona and I held a general review,
and I made them a little speech.&#160;  I began by
telling them that I had learned a good deal about
them, and knew now where they came from.&#160; &#8220;We
did not come from anywhere,&#8221; they cried, interrupting
me; &#8220;we are here!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I told them that every one of them
had a mother of his own, like the mother of the last
baby; that I believed they had all been brought from
Bulika when they were so small that they could not
now remember it; that the wicked princess there was
so afraid of babies, and so determined to destroy
them, that their mothers had to carry them away and
leave them where she could not find them; and that
now we were going to Bulika, to find their mothers,
and deliver them from the bad giantess.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But I must tell you,&#8221;
I continued, &#8220;that there is danger before us,
for, as you know, we may have to fight hard to take
the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can fight! we are ready!&#8221; cried the
boys.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, you can,&#8221; I returned,
&#8220;and I know you will:&#160; mothers are worth
fighting for!&#160;  Only mind, you must all keep together.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, yes; we&#8217;ll take
care of each other,&#8221; they answered.&#160;  &#8220;Nobody
shall touch one of us but his own mother!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You must mind, every one, to
do immediately what your officers tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will, we will!&#8212;&#173;Now we&#8217;re
quite ready!&#160;  Let us go!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Another thing you must not
forget,&#8221; I went on:&#160; &#8220;when you strike,
be sure you make it a downright swinging blow; when
you shoot an arrow, draw it to the head; when you
sling a stone, sling it strong and straight.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That we will!&#8221; they cried
with jubilant, fearless shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will be hurt!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t mind that!&#8212;&#173;Do we,
boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of you may very possibly be killed!&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind being killed!&#8221;
cried one of the finest of the smaller boys:&#160;
he rode a beautiful little bull, which galloped and
jumped like a horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t either!&#160;  I don&#8217;t either!&#8221;
came from all sides.</p>

<p align="justify">Then Lona, queen and mother and sister
of them all, spoke from her big horse by my side:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I would give my life,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;to have my mother!&#160;  She might
kill me if she liked!&#160;  I should just kiss her
and die!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Come along, boys!&#8221; cried
a girl.&#160;  &#8220;We&#8217;re going to our mothers!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A pang went through my heart.&#8212;&#173;But
I could not draw back; it would be moral ruin to the
Little Ones!</p>

<h1>Chapter XXXV</h1>

<p><b>THE LITTLE ONES IN BULIKA</b></p>

<p align="justify">It was early in the morning when we
set out, making, between the blue sky and the green
grass, a gallant show on the wide plain.&#160;  We
would travel all the morning, and rest the afternoon;
then go on at night, rest the next day, and start
again in the short twilight.&#160; The latter part
of our journey we would endeavour so to divide as
to arrive at the city with the first of the morning,
and be already inside the gates when discovered.</p>

<p align="justify">It seemed as if all the inhabitants
of the forest would migrate with us.&#160;  A multitude
of birds flew in front, imagining themselves, no doubt,
the leading division; great companies of butterflies
and other insects played about our heads; and a crowd
of four-footed creatures followed us.&#160;  These
last, when night came, left us almost all; but the
birds and the butterflies, the wasps and the dragon-flies,
went with us to the very gates of the city.</p>

<p align="justify">We halted and slept soundly through
the afternoon:&#160; it was our first real march, but
none were tired.&#160;  In the night we went faster,
because it was cold.&#160;  Many fell asleep on the
backs of their beasts, and woke in the morning quite
fresh.&#160;  None tumbled off.&#160;  Some rode shaggy,
shambling bears, which yet made speed enough, going
as fast as the elephants.&#160;  Others were mounted
on different kinds of deer, and would have been racing
all the way had I not prevented it.&#160; Those atop
of the hay on the elephants, unable to see the animals
below them, would keep talking to them as long as they
were awake.&#160; Once, when we had halted to feed,
I heard a little fellow, as he drew out the hay to
give him, commune thus with his &#8220;darling beast&#8221;:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nosy dear, I am digging you
out of the mountain, and shall soon get down to you:&#160;
be patient; I&#8217;m a coming!&#160;  Very soon now
you&#8217;ll send up your nose to look for me, and
then we&#8217;ll kiss like good elephants, we will!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The same night there burst out such
a tumult of elephant-trumpeting, horse-neighing, and
child-imitation, ringing far over the silent levels,
that, uncertain how near the city might not be, I quickly
stilled the uproar lest it should give warning of our
approach.</p>

<p align="justify">Suddenly, one morning, the sun and
the city rose, as it seemed, together.&#160;  To the
children the walls appeared only a great mass of rock,
but when I told them the inside was full of nests of
stone, I saw apprehension and dislike at once invade
their hearts:&#160; for the first time in their lives,
I believe&#8212;&#173;many of them long little lives&#8212;&#173;they
knew fear.&#160;  The place looked to them bad:&#160;
how were they to find mothers in such a place?&#160;
 But they went on bravely, for they had confidence
in Lona&#8212;&#173;and in me too, little as I deserved
it.</p>

<p align="justify">We rode through the sounding archway.&#160;
 Sure never had such a drumming of hoofs, such a padding
of paws and feet been heard on its old pavement!&#160;
 The horses started and looked scared at the echo
of their own steps; some halted a moment, some plunged
wildly and wheeled about; but they were soon quieted,
and went on.&#160;  Some of the Little Ones shivered,
and all were still as death.&#160;  The three girls
held closer the infants they carried.&#160;  All except
the bears and butterflies manifested fear.</p>

<p align="justify">On the countenance of the woman lay
a dark anxiety; nor was I myself unaffected by the
general dread, for the whole army was on my hands
and on my conscience:&#160; I had brought it up to the
danger whose shadow was now making itself felt!&#160;
 But I was supported by the thought of the coming
kingdom of the Little Ones, with the bad giants its
slaves, and the animals its loving, obedient friends!&#160;
 Alas, I who dreamed thus, had not myself learned
to obey!&#160;  Untrusting, unfaithful obstinacy had
set me at the head of that army of innocents!&#160;
 I was myself but a slave, like any king in the world
I had left who does or would do only what pleases
him!&#160;  But Lona rode beside me a child indeed,
therefore a free woman&#8212;&#173;calm, silent, watchful,
not a whit afraid!</p>

<p align="justify">We were nearly in the heart of the
city before any of its inhabitants became aware of
our presence.&#160;  But now windows began to open,
and sleepy heads to look out.&#160;  Every face wore
at first a dull stare of wonderless astonishment,
which, as soon as the starers perceived the animals,
changed to one of consternation.&#160;  In spite of
their fear, however, when they saw that their invaders
were almost all children, the women came running into
the streets, and the men followed.&#160;  But for a
time all of them kept close to the houses, leaving
open the middle of the way, for they durst not approach
the animals.</p>

<p align="justify">At length a boy, who looked about
five years old, and was full of the idea of his mother,
spying in the crowd a woman whose face attracted him,
threw himself upon her from his antelope, and clung
about her neck; nor was she slow to return his embrace
and kisses.&#160; But the hand of a man came over her
shoulder, and seized him by the neck.&#160;  Instantly
a girl ran her sharp spear into the fellow&#8217;s
arm.&#160;  He sent forth a savage howl, and immediately
stabbed by two or three more, fled yelling.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They are just bad giants!&#8221;
said Lona, her eyes flashing as she drove her horse
against one of unusual height who, having stirred
up the little manhood in him, stood barring her way
with a club.&#160; He dared not abide the shock, but
slunk aside, and the next moment went down, struck
by several stones.&#160;  Another huge fellow, avoiding
my charger, stepped suddenly, with a speech whose rudeness
alone was intelligible, between me and the boy who
rode behind me.&#160;  The boy told him to address
the king; the giant struck his little horse on the
head with a hammer, and he fell.&#160;  Before the brute
could strike again, however, one of the elephants
behind laid him prostrate, and trampled on him so
that he did not attempt to get up until hundreds of
feet had walked over him, and the army was gone by.</p>

<p align="justify">But at sight of the women what a dismay
clouded the face of Lona!&#160; Hardly one of them
was even pleasant to look upon!&#160;  Were her darlings
to find mothers among such as these?</p>

<p align="justify">Hardly had we halted in the central
square, when two girls rode up in anxious haste, with
the tidings that two of the boys had been hurried
away by some women.&#160;  We turned at once, and then
first discovered that the woman we befriended had
disappeared with her baby.</p>

<p align="justify">But at the same moment we descried
a white leopardess come bounding toward us down a
narrow lane that led from the square to the palace.&#160;
The Little Ones had not forgotten the fight of the
two leopardesses in the forest:&#160; some of them
looked terrified, and their ranks began to waver;
but they remembered the order I had just given them,
and stood fast.</p>

<p align="justify">We stopped to see the result; when
suddenly a small boy, called Odu, remarkable for his
speed and courage, who had heard me speak of the goodness
of the white leopardess, leaped from the back of his
bear, which went shambling after him, and ran to meet
her.&#160;  The leopardess, to avoid knocking him down,
pulled herself up so suddenly that she went rolling
over and over:&#160; when she recovered her feet she
found the child on her back.&#160;  Who could doubt
the subjugation of a people which saw an urchin of
the enemy bestride an animal of which they lived in
daily terror?&#160;  Confident of the effect on the
whole army, we rode on.</p>

<p align="justify">As we stopped at the house to which
our guides led us, we heard a scream; I sprang down,
and thundered at the door.&#160;  My horse came and
pushed me away with his nose, turned about, and had
begun to batter the door with his heels, when up came
little Odu on the leopardess, and at sight of her
he stood still, trembling.&#160;  But she too had heard
the cry, and forgetting the child on her back, threw
herself at the door; the boy was dashed against it,
and fell senseless.&#160;  Before I could reach him,
Lona had him in her arms, and as soon as he came to
himself, set him on the back of his bear, which had
still followed him.</p>

<p align="justify">When the leopardess threw herself
the third time against the door, it gave way, and
she darted in.&#160;  We followed, but she had already
vanished.&#160;  We sprang up a stair, and went all
over the house, to find no one.&#160;  Darting down
again, we spied a door under the stair, and got into
a labyrinth of excavations.&#160;  We had not gone far,
however, when we met the leopardess with the child
we sought across her back.</p>

<p align="justify">He told us that the woman he took
for his mother threw him into a hole, saying she would
give him to the leopardess.&#160;  But the leopardess
was a good one, and took him out.</p>

<p align="justify">Following in search of the other boy,
we got into the next house more easily, but to find,
alas, that we were too late:&#160; one of the savages
had just killed the little captive!&#160;  It consoled
Lona, however, to learn which he was, for she had
been expecting him to grow a bad giant, from which
worst of fates death had saved him.&#160; The leopardess
sprang upon his murderer, took him by the throat,
dragged him into the street, and followed Lona with
him, like a cat with a great rat in her jaws.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Let us leave the horrible place,&#8221;
said Lona; &#8220;there are no mothers here!&#160;
 This people is not worth delivering.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The leopardess dropped her burden,
and charged into the crowd, this way and that, wherever
it was thickest.&#160;  The slaves cried out and ran,
tumbling over each other in heaps.</p>

<p align="justify">When we got back to the army, we found
it as we had left it, standing in order and ready.</p>

<p align="justify">But I was far from easy:&#160; the
princess gave no sign, and what she might be plotting
we did not know!&#160;  Watch and ward must be kept
the night through!</p>

<p align="justify">The Little Ones were such hardy creatures
that they could repose anywhere:&#160; we told them
to lie down with their animals where they were, and
sleep till they were called.&#160;  In one moment they
were down, and in another lapt in the music of their
sleep, a sound as of water over grass, or a soft wind
among leaves.&#160;  Their animals slept more lightly,
ever on the edge of waking.&#160;  The bigger boys
and girls walked softly hither and thither among the
dreaming multitude.&#160;  All was still; the whole
wicked place appeared at rest.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXVI</h1>

<p><b>MOTHER AND DAUGHTER</b></p>

<p align="justify">Lona was so disgusted with the people,
and especially with the women, that she wished to
abandon the place as soon as possible; I, on the contrary,
felt very strongly that to do so would be to fail
wilfully where success was possible; and, far worse,
to weaken the hearts of the Little Ones, and so bring
them into much greater danger.&#160;  If we retreated,
it was certain the princess would not leave us unassailed!
if we encountered her, the hope of the prophecy went
with us!&#160;  Mother and daughter must meet:&#160;
it might be that Lona&#8217;s loveliness would take
Lilith&#8217;s heart by storm! if she threatened violence,
I should be there between them!&#160;  If I found that
I had no other power over her, I was ready, for the
sake of my Lona, to strike her pitilessly on the closed
hand!&#160;  I knew she was doomed:&#160; most likely
it was decreed that her doom should now be brought
to pass through us!</p>

<p align="justify">Still without hint of the relation
in which she stood to the princess, I stated the case
to Lona as it appeared to me.&#160;  At once she agreed
to accompany me to the palace.</p>

<p align="justify">&#62;From the top of one of its great
towers, the princess had, in the early morning, while
the city yet slept, descried the approach of the army
of the Little Ones.&#160;  The sight awoke in her an
over-mastering terror:&#160; she had failed in her
endeavour to destroy them, and they were upon her!&#160;
 The prophecy was about to be fulfilled!</p>

<p align="justify">When she came to herself, she descended
to the black hall, and seated herself in the north
focus of the ellipse, under the opening in the roof.</p>

<p align="justify">For she must think!&#160;  Now what
she called <i>thinking</i> required a clear consciousness
of herself, not as she was, but as she chose to believe
herself; and to aid her in the realisation of this
consciousness, she had suspended, a little way from
and above her, itself invisible in the darkness of
the hall, a mirror to receive the full sunlight reflected
from her person.&#160;  For the resulting vision of
herself in the splendour of her beauty, she sat waiting
the meridional sun.</p>

<p align="justify">Many a shadow moved about her in the
darkness, but as often as, with a certain inner eye
which she had, she caught sight of one, she refused
to regard it.&#160;  Close under the mirror stood the
Shadow which attended her walks, but, self-occupied,
him she did not see.</p>

<p align="justify">The city was taken; the inhabitants
were cowering in terror; the Little Ones and their
strange cavalry were encamped in the square; the sun
shone upon the princess, and for a few minutes she
saw herself glorious.&#160;  The vision passed, but
she sat on.&#160;  The night was now come, and darkness
clothed and filled the glass, yet she did not move.&#160;
 A gloom that swarmed with shadows, wallowed in the
palace; the servants shivered and shook, but dared
not leave it because of the beasts of the Little Ones;
all night long the princess sat motionless:&#160; she
must see her beauty again! she must try again to think!&#160;
 But courage and will had grown weary of her, and would
dwell with her no more!</p>

<p align="justify">In the morning we chose twelve of
the tallest and bravest of the boys to go with us
to the palace.&#160;  We rode our great horses, and
they small horses and elephants.</p>

<p align="justify">The princess sat waiting the sun to
give her the joy of her own presence.&#160;  The tide
of the light was creeping up the shore of the sky,
but until the sun stood overhead, not a ray could enter
the black hall.</p>

<p align="justify">He rose to our eyes, and swiftly ascended.&#160;
 As we climbed the steep way to the palace, he climbed
the dome of its great hall.&#160;  He looked in at
the eye of it&#8212;&#173;and with sudden radiance the
princess flashed upon her own sight.&#160;  But she
sprang to her feet with a cry of despair:&#160; alas
her whiteness! the spot covered half her side, and
was black as the marble around her!&#160;  She clutched
her robe, and fell back in her chair.&#160;  The Shadow
glided out, and she saw him go.</p>

<p align="justify">We found the gate open as usual, passed
through the paved grove up to the palace door, and
entered the vestibule.&#160;  There in her cage lay
the spotted leopardess, apparently asleep or lifeless.&#160;
 The Little Ones paused a moment to look at her.&#160;
 She leaped up rampant against the cage.&#160;  The
horses reared and plunged; the elephants retreated
a step.&#160;  The next instant she fell supine, writhed
in quivering spasms, and lay motionless.&#160;  We
rode into the great hall.</p>

<p align="justify">The princess yet leaned back in her
chair in the shaft of sunlight, when from the stones
of the court came to her ears the noise of the horses&#8217;
hoofs.&#160;  She started, listened, and shook:&#160;
never had such sound been heard in her palace!&#160;
 She pressed her hand to her side, and gasped.&#160;
 The trampling came nearer and nearer; it entered the
hall itself; moving figures that were not shadows approached
her through the darkness!</p>

<p align="justify">For us, we saw a splendour, a glorious
woman centring the dark.&#160; Lona sprang from her
horse, and bounded to her.&#160;  I sprang from mine,
and followed Lona.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mother! mother!&#8221; she
cried, and her clear, lovely voice echoed in the dome.</p>

<p align="justify">The princess shivered; her face grew
almost black with hate, her eyebrows met on her forehead.&#160;
 She rose to her feet, and stood.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mother! mother!&#8221; cried
Lona again, as she leaped on the da&#239;s, and flung her
arms around the princess.</p>

<p align="justify">An instant more and I should have
reached them!&#8212;&#173;in that instant I saw Lona
lifted high, and dashed on the marble floor.&#160; 
Oh, the horrible sound of her fall!&#160;  At my feet
she fell, and lay still.&#160; The princess sat down
with the smile of a demoness.</p>

<p align="justify">I dropped on my knees beside Lona,
raised her from the stones, and pressed her to my
bosom.&#160;  With indignant hate I glanced at the
princess; she answered me with her sweetest smile.&#160;
 I would have sprung upon her, taken her by the throat,
and strangled her, but love of the child was stronger
than hate of the mother, and I clasped closer my precious
burden.&#160;  Her arms hung helpless; her blood trickled
over my hands, and fell on the floor with soft, slow
little plashes.</p>

<p align="justify">The horses scented it&#8212;&#173;mine
first, then the small ones.&#160;  Mine reared, shivering
and wild-eyed, went about, and thundered blindly down
the dark hall, with the little horses after him.&#160;
 Lona&#8217;s stood gazing down at his mistress, and
trembling all over.&#160;  The boys flung themselves
from their horses&#8217; backs, and they, not seeing
the black wall before them, dashed themselves, with
mine, to pieces against it.&#160;  The elephants came
on to the foot of the da&#239;s, and stopped, wildly trumpeting;
the Little Ones sprang upon it, and stood horrified;
the princess lay back in her seat, her face that of
a corpse, her eyes alone alive, wickedly flaming.&#160;
 She was again withered and wasted to what I found
in the wood, and her side was as if a great branding
hand had been laid upon it.&#160;  But Lona saw nothing,
and I saw but Lona.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother! mother!&#8221; she sighed, and her
breathing ceased.</p>

<p align="justify">I carried her into the court:&#160;
the sun shone upon a white face, and the pitiful shadow
of a ghostly smile.&#160;  Her head hung back.&#160;
 She was &#8220;dead as earth.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I forgot the Little Ones, forgot the
murdering princess, forgot the body in my arms, and
wandered away, looking for my Lona.&#160;  The doors
and windows were crowded with brute-faces jeering at
me, but not daring to speak, for they saw the white
leopardess behind me, hanging her head close at my
heel.&#160;  I spurned her with my foot.&#160; She held
back a moment, and followed me again.</p>

<p align="justify">I reached the square:&#160; the little
army was gone!&#160;  Its emptiness roused me.&#160;
 Where were the Little Ones, <i>her</i> Little Ones?&#160;
 I had lost her children!&#160;  I stared helpless
about me, staggered to the pillar, and sank upon its
base.</p>

<p align="justify">But as I sat gazing on the still countenance,
it seemed to smile a live momentary smile.&#160;  I
never doubted it an illusion, yet believed what it
said:&#160; I should yet see her alive!&#160;  It was
not she, it was I who was lost, and she would find
me!</p>

<p align="justify">I rose to go after the Little Ones,
and instinctively sought the gate by which we had
entered.&#160;  I looked around me, but saw nothing
of the leopardess.</p>

<p align="justify">The street was rapidly filling with
a fierce crowd.&#160;  They saw me encumbered with
my dead, but for a time dared not assail me.&#160; 
Ere I reached the gate, however, they had gathered
courage.&#160;  The women began to hustle me; I held
on heedless.&#160;  A man pushed against my sacred
burden:&#160; with a kick I sent him away howling.&#160;
 But the crowd pressed upon me, and fearing for the
dead that was beyond hurt, I clasped my treasure closer,
and freed my right arm.&#160;  That instant, however,
a commotion arose in the street behind me; the crowd
broke; and through it came the Little Ones I had left
in the palace.&#160;  Ten of them were upon four of
the elephants; on the two other elephants lay the
princess, bound hand and foot, and quite still, save
that her eyes rolled in their ghastly sockets.&#160;
 The two other Little Ones rode behind her on Lona&#8217;s
horse.&#160;  Every now and then the wise creatures
that bore her threw their trunks behind and felt her
cords.</p>

<p align="justify">I walked on in front, and out of the
city.&#160;  What an end to the hopes with which I
entered the evil place!&#160;  We had captured the bad
princess, and lost our all-beloved queen!&#160;  My
life was bare! my heart was empty!</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXVII</h1>

<p><b>THE SHADOW</b></p>

<p align="justify">A murmur of pleasure from my companions
roused me:&#160; they had caught sight of their fellows
in the distance!&#160;  The two on Lona&#8217;s horse
rode on to join them.&#160;  They were greeted with
a wavering shout&#8212;&#173;which immediately died
away.&#160;  As we drew near, the sound of their sobs
reached us like the breaking of tiny billows.</p>

<p align="justify">When I came among them, I saw that
something dire had befallen them:&#160; on their childish
faces was the haggard look left by some strange terror.&#160;
 No possible grief could have wrought the change.&#160;
 A few of them came slowly round me, and held out
their arms to take my burden.&#160; I yielded it; the
tender hopelessness of the smile with which they received
it, made my heart swell with pity in the midst of its
own desolation.&#160;  In vain were their sobs over
their mother-queen; in vain they sought to entice
from her some recognition of their love; in vain they
kissed and fondled her as they bore her away:&#160;
she would not wake!&#160;  On each side one carried
an arm, gently stroking it; as many as could get near,
put their arms under her body; those who could not,
crowded around the bearers.&#160;  On a spot where the
grass grew thicker and softer they laid her down,
and there all the Little Ones gathered sobbing.</p>

<p align="justify">Outside the crowd stood the elephants,
and I near them, gazing at my Lona over the many little
heads between.&#160;  Those next me caught sight of
the princess, and stared trembling.&#160;  Odu was the
first to speak.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have seen that woman before!&#8221;
he whispered to his next neighbour.&#160; &#8220;It
was she who fought the white leopardess, the night
they woke us with their yelling!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Silly!&#8221; returned his
companion.&#160;  &#8220;That was a wild beast, with
spots!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Look at her eyes!&#8221; insisted
Odu.&#160;  &#8220;I know she is a bad giantess, but
she is a wild beast all the same.&#160;  I know she
is the spotted one!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The other took a step nearer; Odu
drew him back with a sharp pull.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Don&#8217;t look at her!&#8221;
he cried, shrinking away, yet fascinated by the hate-filled
longing in her eyes.&#160;  &#8220;She would eat you
up in a moment!&#160; It was <i>her</i> shadow!&#160;
 She is the wicked princess!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That cannot be! they said she was beautiful!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Indeed it is the princess!&#8221;
I interposed.&#160;  &#8220;Wickedness has made her
ugly!&#8221;</p>

<p>She heard, and what a look was hers!</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very wrong of me to run away!&#8221;
said Odu thoughtfully.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What made you run away?&#8221;
I asked.&#160;  &#8220;I expected to find you where
I left you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not reply at once.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what made
me run,&#8221; answered another.&#160;  &#8220;I was
frightened!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a man that came down the hill from the
palace,&#8221; said a third.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he frighten you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t a man,&#8221;
said Odu; &#8220;he was a shadow; he had no thick to
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me more about him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He came down the hill very
black, walking like a bad giant, but spread flat.&#160;
 He was nothing but blackness.&#160;  We were frightened
the moment we saw him, but we did not run away; we
stood and watched him.&#160; He came on as if he would
walk over us.&#160;  But before he reached us, he began
to spread and spread, and grew bigger end bigger, till
at last he was so big that he went out of our sight,
and we saw him no more, and then he was upon us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He was all black through between
us, and we could not see one another; and then he
was inside us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know he was inside you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He did me quite different.&#160;
 I felt like bad.&#160;  I was not Odu any more&#8212;&#173;not
the Odu I knew.&#160;  I wanted to tear Sozo to pieces&#8212;&#173;not
really, but like!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and hugged Sozo.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t me, Sozo,&#8221;
he sobbed.&#160;  &#8220;Really, deep down, it was Odu,
loving you always!&#160;  And Odu came up, and knocked
Naughty away.&#160;  I grew sick, and thought I must
kill myself to get out of the black.&#160; Then came
a horrible laugh that had heard my think, and it set
the air trembling about me.&#160;  And then I suppose
I ran away, but I did not know I had run away until
I found myself running, fast as could, and all the
rest running too.&#160;  I would have stopped, but I
never thought of it until I was out of the gate among
the grass.&#160;  Then I knew that I had run away from
a shadow that wanted to be me and wasn&#8217;t, and
that I was the Odu that loved Sozo.&#160;  It was the
shadow that got into me, and hated him from inside
me; it was not my own self me!&#160;  And now I know
that I ought not to have run away!&#160;  But indeed
I did not quite know what I was doing until it was
done!&#160;  My legs did it, I think:&#160; they grew
frightened, and forgot me, and ran away!&#160;  Naughty
legs!&#160;  There! and there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus ended Odu, with a kick to each of his naughty
legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of the shadow?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; he answered.&#160;
 &#8220;I suppose he went home into the night where
there is no moon.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I fell a wondering where Lona was
gone, and dropping on the grass, took the dead thing
in my lap, and whispered in its ear, &#8220;Where
are you, Lona?&#160;  I love you!&#8221;  But its lips
gave no answer.&#160;  I kissed them, not quite cold,
laid the body down again, and appointing a guard over
it, rose to provide for the safety of Lona&#8217;s
people during the night.</p>

<p align="justify">Before the sun went down, I had set
a watch over the princess outside the camp, and sentinels
round it:&#160; intending to walk about it myself all
night long, I told the rest of the army to go to sleep.&#160;
They threw themselves on the grass and were asleep
in a moment.</p>

<p align="justify">When the moon rose I caught a glimpse
of something white; it was the leopardess.&#160;  She
swept silently round the sleeping camp, and I saw
her pass three times between the princess and the Little
Ones.&#160; Thereupon I made the watch lie down with
the others, and stretched myself beside the body of
Lona.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h1>

<p><b>TO THE HOUSE OF BITTERNESS</b></p>

<p align="justify">In the morning we set out, and made
for the forest as fast as we could.&#160;  I rode Lona&#8217;s
horse, and carried her body.&#160;  I would take it
to her father:&#160; he would give it a couch in the
chamber of his dead! or, if he would not, seeing she
had not come of herself, I would watch it in the desert
until it mouldered away!&#160;  But I believed he would,
for surely she had died long ago!&#160;  Alas, how bitterly
must I not humble myself before him!</p>

<p align="justify">To Adam I must take Lilith also.&#160;
 I had no power to make her repent!&#160; I had hardly
a right to slay her&#8212;&#173;much less a right to
let her loose in the world! and surely I scarce merited
being made for ever her gaoler!</p>

<p align="justify">Again and again, on the way, I offered
her food; but she answered only with a look of hungering
hate.&#160;  Her fiery eyes kept rolling to and fro,
nor ever closed, I believe, until we reached the other
side of the hot stream.&#160;  After that they never
opened until we came to the House of Bitterness.</p>

<p align="justify">One evening, as we were camping for
the night, I saw a little girl go up to her, and ran
to prevent mischief.&#160;  But ere I could reach them,
the child had put something to the lips of the princess,
and given a scream of pain.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Please, king,&#8221; she whimpered,
&#8220;suck finger.&#160;  Bad giantess make hole in
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>I sucked the tiny finger.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well now!&#8221; she cried,
and a minute after was holding a second fruit to a
mouth greedy of other fare.&#160;  But this time she
snatched her hand quickly away, and the fruit fell
to the ground.&#160;  The child&#8217;s name was Luva.</p>

<p align="justify">The next day we crossed the hot stream.&#160;
 Again on their own ground, the Little Ones were jubilant.&#160;
 But their nests were still at a great distance, and
that day we went no farther than the ivy-hall, where,
because of its grapes, I had resolved to spend the
night.&#160; When they saw the great clusters, at once
they knew them good, rushed upon them, ate eagerly,
and in a few minutes were all fast asleep on the green
floor and in the forest around the hall.&#160;  Hoping
again to see the dance, and expecting the Little Ones
to sleep through it, I had made them leave a wide
space in the middle.&#160;  I lay down among them,
with Lona by my side, but did not sleep.</p>

<p align="justify">The night came, and suddenly the company
was there.&#160;  I was wondering with myself whether,
night after night, they would thus go on dancing to
all eternity, and whether I should not one day have
to join them because of my stiff-neckedness, when
the eyes of the children came open, and they sprang
to their feet, wide awake.&#160; Immediately every
one caught hold of a dancer, and away they went, bounding
and skipping.&#160;  The spectres seemed to see and
welcome them:&#160; perhaps they knew all about the
Little Ones, for they had themselves long been on
their way back to childhood!&#160;  Anyhow, their innocent
gambols must, I thought, bring refreshment to weary
souls who, their present taken from them and their
future dark, had no life save the shadow of their
vanished past.&#160;  Many a merry but never a rude
prank did the children play; and if they did at times
cause a momentary jar in the rhythm of the dance,
the poor spectres, who had nothing to smile withal,
at least manifested no annoyance.</p>

<p align="justify">Just ere the morning began to break,
I started to see the skeleton-princess in the doorway,
her eyes open and glowing, the fearful spot black
on her side.&#160;  She stood for a moment, then came
gliding in, as if she would join the dance.&#160;  I
sprang to my feet.&#160; A cry of repugnant fear broke
from the children, and the lights vanished.&#160; 
But the low moon looked in, and I saw them clinging
to each other.&#160;  The ghosts were gone&#8212;&#173;at
least they were no longer visible.&#160;  The princess
too had disappeared.&#160;  I darted to the spot where
I had left her:&#160; she lay with her eyes closed,
as if she had never moved.&#160;  I returned to the
hall.&#160;  The Little Ones were already on the floor,
composing themselves to sleep.</p>

<p align="justify">The next morning, as we started, we
spied, a little way from us, two skeletons moving
about in a thicket.&#160;  The Little Ones broke their
ranks, and ran to them.&#160;  I followed; and, although
now walking at ease, without splint or ligature, I
was able to recognise the pair I had before seen in
that neighbourhood.&#160;  The children at once made
friends with them, laying hold of their arms, and stroking
the bones of their long fingers; and it was plain the
poor creatures took their attentions kindly.&#160;
 The two seemed on excellent terms with each other.&#160;
 Their common deprivation had drawn them together!
the loss of everything had been the beginning of a
new life to them!</p>

<p align="justify">Perceiving that they had gathered
handfuls of herbs, and were looking for more&#8212;&#173;presumably
to rub their bones with, for in what other way could
nourishment reach their system so rudimentary?&#8212;&#173;the
Little Ones, having keenly examined those they held,
gathered of the same sorts, and filled the hands the
skeletons held out to receive them.&#160;  Then they
bid them goodbye, promising to come and see them again,
and resumed their journey, saying to each other they
had not known there were such nice people living in
the same forest.</p>

<p align="justify">When we came to the nest-village,
I remained there a night with them, to see them resettled;
for Lona still looked like one just dead, and there
seemed no need of haste.</p>

<p align="justify">The princess had eaten nothing, and
her eyes remained shut:&#160; fearing she might die
ere we reached the end of our journey, I went to her
in the night, and laid my bare arm upon her lips.&#160;
 She bit into it so fiercely that I cried out.&#160;
 How I got away from her I do not know, but I came
to myself lying beyond her reach.&#160;  It was then
morning, and immediately I set about our departure.</p>

<p align="justify">Choosing twelve Little Ones, not of
the biggest and strongest, but of the sweetest and
merriest, I mounted them on six elephants, and took
two more of the wise <i>clumsies</i>, as the children
called them, to bear the princess.&#160;  I still rode
Lona&#8217;s horse, and carried her body wrapt in
her cloak before me.&#160;  As nearly as I could judge
I took the direct way, across the left branch of the
river-bed, to the House of Bitterness, where I hoped
to learn how best to cross the broader and rougher
branch, and how to avoid the basin of monsters:&#160;
I dreaded the former for the elephants, the latter
for the children.</p>

<p align="justify">I had one terrible night on the way&#8212;&#173;the
third, passed in the desert between the two branches
of the dead river.</p>

<p align="justify">We had stopped the elephants in a
sheltered place, and there let the princess slip down
between them, to lie on the sand until the morning.&#160;
 She seemed quite dead, but I did not think she was.&#160;
 I laid myself a little way from her, with the body
of Lona by my other side, thus to keep watch at once
over the dead and the dangerous.&#160; The moon was
half-way down the west, a pale, thoughtful moon, mottling
the desert with shadows.&#160;  Of a sudden she was
eclipsed, remaining visible, but sending forth no
light:&#160; a thick, diaphanous film covered her patient
beauty, and she looked troubled.&#160;  The film swept
a little aside, and I saw the edge of it against her
clearness&#8212;&#173;the jagged outline of a bat-like
wing, torn and hooked.&#160; Came a cold wind with
a burning sting&#8212;&#173;and Lilith was upon me.&#160;
 Her hands were still bound, but with her teeth she
pulled from my shoulder the cloak Lona made for me,
and fixed them in my flesh.&#160;  I lay as one paralysed.</p>

<p align="justify">Already the very life seemed flowing
from me into her, when I remembered, and struck her
on the hand.&#160;  She raised her head with a gurgling
shriek, and I felt her shiver.&#160;  I flung her from
me, and sprang to my feet.</p>

<p align="justify">She was on her knees, and rocked herself
to and fro.&#160;  A second blast of hot-stinging cold
enveloped us; the moon shone out clear, and I saw
her face&#8212;&#173;gaunt and ghastly, besmeared with
red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down, devil!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Where are you taking me?&#8221;
she asked, with the voice of a dull echo from a sepulchre.</p>

<p>&#8220;To your first husband,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will kill me!&#8221; she moaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least he will take you off my hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me my daughter,&#8221; she suddenly screamed,
grinding her teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#160;  Your doom is upon you at last!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Loose my hands for pity&#8217;s
sake!&#8221; she groaned.&#160;  &#8220;I am in torture.&#160;
The cords are sunk in my flesh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not.&#160;  Lie down!&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>She threw herself on the ground like a log.</p>

<p align="justify">The rest of the night passed in peace,
and in the morning she again seemed dead.</p>

<p align="justify">Before evening we came in sight of
the House of Bitterness, and the next moment one of
the elephants came alongside of my horse.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Please, king, you are not going
to that place?&#8221; whispered the Little One who
rode on his neck.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Indeed I am!&#160;  We are going
to stay the night there,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, please, don&#8217;t!&#160;
 That must be where the cat-woman lives!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If you had ever seen her, you
would not call her by that name!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nobody ever sees her:&#160;
she has lost her face!&#160;  Her head is back and
side all round.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She hides her face from dull,
discontented people!&#8212;&#173;Who taught you to
call her the cat-woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard the bad giants call her so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they say about her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That she had claws to her toes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not true.&#160;  I know the lady.&#160;
 I spent a night at her house.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But she <i>may</i> have claws
to her toes!&#160;  You might see her feet, and her
claws be folded up inside their cushions!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you think that I have claws to
my toes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; that can&#8217;t be! you are good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The giants might have told you so!&#8221; I
pursued.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t believe them about you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the giants good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; they love lying.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then why do you believe them
about her?&#160;  I know the lady is good; she cannot
have claws.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please how do you know she is good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know I am good?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I rode on, while he waited for his
companions, and told them what I had said.</p>

<p>They hastened after me, and when they came up,&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I would not take you to her
house if I did not believe her good,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know you would not,&#8221; they answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were to do something that frightened you&#8212;&#173;what
would you say?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The beasts frightened us sometimes
at first, but they never hurt us!&#8221; answered
one.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was before we knew them!&#8221; added
another.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Just so!&#8221; I answered.&#160;
 &#8220;When you see the woman in that cottage, you
will know that she is good.&#160;  You may wonder at
what she does, but she will always be good.&#160; 
I know her better than you know me.&#160;  She will
not hurt you,&#8212;&#173;or if she does,&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, you are not sure about
it, king dear!&#160;  You think she <i>may</i> hurt us!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am sure she will never be
unkind to you, even if she do hurt you!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent for a while.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of being
hurt&#8212;&#173;a little!&#8212;&#173;a good deal!&#8221;
cried Odu.&#160; &#8220;But I should not like scratches
in the dark!&#160;  The giants say the cat-woman has
claw-feet all over her house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am taking the princess to her,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because she is her friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can she be good then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Little Tumbledown is a friend
of the princess,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;so is Luva:&#160;
I saw them both, more than once, trying to feed her
with grapes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Tumbledown is good!&#160;  Luva is very
good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is why they are her friends.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Will the cat-woman&#8212;&#173;I
mean the woman that isn&#8217;t the cat-woman, and
has no claws to her toes&#8212;&#173;give her grapes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is more likely to give her scratches!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8212;&#173;You say she is her friend!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is just why.&#8212;&#173;A
friend is one who gives us what we need, and the princess
is sorely in need of a terrible scratching.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent again.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If any of you are afraid,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;you may go home; I shall not prevent
you.&#160;  But I cannot take one with me who believes
the giants rather than me, or one who will call a
good lady the cat-woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, king,&#8221; said one, &#8220;I&#8217;m
so afraid of being afraid!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My boy,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;there is no harm in being afraid.&#160;  The
only harm is in doing what Fear tells you.&#160;  Fear
is not your master!&#160; Laugh in his face and he
will run away.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There she is&#8212;&#173;in
the door waiting for us!&#8221; cried one, and put
his hands over his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How ugly she is!&#8221; cried another, and
did the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not see her,&#8221; I said; &#8220;her
face is covered!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has no face!&#8221; they answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She has a very beautiful face.&#160;
 I saw it once.&#8212;&#173;It is indeed as beautiful
as Lona&#8217;s!&#8221; I added with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what makes her hide it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know:&#8212;&#173;anyhow, she has
some good reason for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the cat-woman! she is frightful!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You cannot like, and you ought
not to dislike what you have never seen.&#8212;&#173;Once
more, you must not call her the cat-woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we to call her then, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Mara.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is a pretty name!&#8221;
said a girl; &#8220;I will call her `lady Mara&#8217;;
then perhaps she will show me her beautiful face!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Mara, drest and muffled in white,
was indeed standing in the doorway to receive us.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;At last!&#8221; she said.&#160;
 &#8220;Lilith&#8217;s hour has been long on the way,
but it is come!&#160;  Everything comes.&#160;  Thousands
of years have I waited&#8212;&#173;and not in vain!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She came to me, took my treasure from
my arms, carried it into the house, and returning,
took the princess.&#160;  Lilith shuddered, but made
no resistance.&#160;  The beasts lay down by the door.&#160;
 We followed our hostess, the Little Ones looking
very grave.&#160;  She laid the princess on a rough
settle at one side of the room, unbound her, and turned
to us.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mr. Vane,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and you, Little Ones, I thank you!&#160;  This
woman would not yield to gentler measures; harder must
have their turn.&#160;  I must do what I can to make
her repent!&#8221;</p>

<p>The pitiful-hearted Little Ones began to sob sorely.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Will you hurt her very much,
lady Mara?&#8221; said the girl I have just mentioned,
putting her warm little hand in mine.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes; I am afraid I must; I
fear she will make me!&#8221; answered Mara.&#160;
&#8220;It would be cruel to hurt her too little.&#160;
 It would have all to be done again, only worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I stop with her?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No, my child.&#160;  She loves
no one, therefore she cannot be <i>with</i> any one.&#160;
 There is One who will be with her, but she will not
be with Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the shadow that came down the hill be
with her?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The great Shadow will be in
her, I fear, but he cannot be <i>with</i> her, or with
any one.&#160;  She will know I am beside her, but that
will not comfort her.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Will you scratch her very deep?&#8221;
asked Odu, going near, and putting his hand in hers.&#160;
 &#8220;Please, don&#8217;t make the red juice come!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She caught him up, turned her back
to the rest of us, drew the muffling down from her
face, and held him at arms&#8217; length that he might
see her.</p>

<p align="justify">As if his face had been a mirror,
I saw in it what he saw.&#160;  For one moment he stared,
his little mouth open; then a divine wonder arose
in his countenance, and swiftly changed to intense
delight.&#160; For a minute he gazed entranced, then
she set him down.&#160;  Yet a moment he stood looking
up at her, lost in contemplation&#8212;&#173;then ran
to us with the face of a prophet that knows a bliss
he cannot tell.&#160; Mara rearranged her mufflings,
and turned to the other children.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You must eat and drink before
you go to sleep,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you have
had a long journey!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She set the bread of her house before
them, and a jug of cold water.&#160; They had never
seen bread before, and this was hard and dry, but
they ate it without sign of distaste.&#160;  They had
never seen water before, but they drank without demur,
one after the other looking up from the draught with
a face of glad astonishment.&#160;  Then she led away
the smallest, and the rest went trooping after her.&#160;
 With her own gentle hands, they told me, she put
them to bed on the floor of the garret.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXIX</h1>

<p><b>THAT NIGHT</b></p>

<p align="justify">Their night was a troubled one, and
they brought a strange report of it into the day.&#160;
 Whether the fear of their sleep came out into their
waking, or their waking fear sank with them into their
dreams, awake or asleep they were never at rest from
it.&#160;  All night something seemed going on in the
house&#8212;&#173;something silent, something terrible,
something they were not to know.&#160;  Never a sound
awoke; the darkness was one with the silence, and
the silence was the terror.</p>

<p align="justify">Once, a frightful wind filled the
house, and shook its inside, they said, so that it
quivered and trembled like a horse shaking himself;
but it was a silent wind that made not even a moan
in their chamber, and passed away like a soundless
sob.</p>

<p align="justify">They fell asleep.&#160;  But they woke
again with a great start.&#160;  They thought the house
was filling with water such as they had been drinking.&#160;
 It came from below, and swelled up until the garret
was full of it to the very roof.&#160;  But it made
no more sound than the wind, and when it sank away,
they fell asleep dry and warm.</p>

<p align="justify">The next time they woke, all the air,
they said, inside and out, was full of cats.&#160;
 They swarmed&#8212;&#173;up and down, along and across,
everywhere about the room.&#160;  They felt their claws
trying to get through the night-gowns lady Mara had
put on them, but they could not; and in the morning
not one of them had a scratch.&#160;  Through the dark
suddenly, came the only sound they heard the night
long&#8212;&#173;the far-off howl of the huge great-grandmother-cat
in the desert:&#160; she must have been calling her
little ones, they thought, for that instant the cats
stopped, and all was still.&#160;  Once more they fell
fast asleep, and did not wake till the sun was rising.</p>

<p align="justify">Such was the account the children
gave of their experiences.&#160;  But I was with the
veiled woman and the princess all through the night:&#160;
something of what took place I saw; much I only felt;
and there was more which eye could not see, and heart
only could in a measure understand.</p>

<p align="justify">As soon as Mara left the room with
the children, my eyes fell on the white leopardess:&#160;
I thought we had left her behind us, but there she
was, cowering in a corner.&#160;  Apparently she was
in mortal terror of what she might see.&#160;  A lamp
stood on the high chimney-piece, and sometimes the
room seemed full of lamp-shadows, sometimes of cloudy
forms.&#160;  The princess lay on the settle by the
wall, and seemed never to have moved hand or foot.&#160;
 It was a fearsome waiting.</p>

<p align="justify">When Mara returned, she drew the settle
with Lilith upon it to the middle of the room, then
sat down opposite me, at the other side of the hearth.&#160;
 Between us burned a small fire.</p>

<p align="justify">Something terrible was on its way!&#160;
 The cloudy presences flickered and shook.&#160;  A
silvery creature like a slowworm came crawling out
from among them, slowly crossed the clay floor, and
crept into the fire.&#160;  We sat motionless.&#160;
 The something came nearer.</p>

<p align="justify">But the hours passed, midnight drew
nigh, and there was no change.&#160; The night was
very still.&#160;  Not a sound broke the silence, not
a rustle from the fire, not a crack from board or
beam.&#160;  Now and again I felt a sort of heave,
but whether in the earth or in the air or in the waters
under the earth, whether in my own body or in my soul&#8212;&#173;whether
it was anywhere, I could not tell.&#160;  A dread sense
of judgment was upon me.&#160;  But I was not afraid,
for I had ceased to care for aught save the thing
that must be done.</p>

<p align="justify">Suddenly it was midnight.&#160;  The
muffled woman rose, turned toward the settle, and
slowly unwound the long swathes that hid her face:&#160;
they dropped on the ground, and she stepped over them.&#160;
 The feet of the princess were toward the hearth;
Mara went to her head, and turning, stood behind it.&#160;
 Then I saw her face.&#160;  It was lovely beyond speech&#8212;&#173;white
and sad, heart-and-soul sad, but not unhappy, and
I knew it never could be unhappy.&#160;  Great tears
were running down her cheeks:&#160; she wiped them
away with her robe; her countenance grew very still,
and she wept no more.&#160;  But for the pity in every
line of her expression, she would have seemed severe.&#160;
 She laid her hand on the head of the princess&#8212;&#173;on
the hair that grew low on the forehead, and stooping,
breathed on the sallow brow.&#160;  The body shuddered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Will you turn away from the
wicked things you have been doing so long?&#8221;
said Mara gently.</p>

<p align="justify">The princess did not answer.&#160;
 Mara put the question again, in the same soft, inviting
tone.</p>

<p align="justify">Still there was no sign of hearing.&#160;
 She spoke the words a third time.</p>

<p align="justify">Then the seeming corpse opened its
mouth and answered, its words appearing to frame themselves
of something else than sound.&#8212;&#173;I cannot
shape the thing further:&#160; sounds they were not,
yet they were words to me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will not,&#8221; she said.&#160;
 &#8220;I will be myself and not another!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Alas, you are another now,
not yourself!&#160;  Will you not be your real self?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be what I mean myself now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If you were restored, would
you not make what amends you could for the misery
you have caused?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would do after my nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know it:&#160; your nature is good,
and you do evil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do as my Self pleases&#8212;&#173;as
my Self desires.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do as the Shadow, overshadowing your
Self inclines you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do what I will to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have killed your daughter, Lilith!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have killed thousands.&#160;  She is my own!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was never yours as you are another&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not another&#8217;s; I am my own, and
my daughter is mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, alas, your hour is come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I care not.&#160;  I am what I am; no one can
take from me myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not the Self you imagine.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So long as I feel myself what
it pleases me to think myself, I care not.&#160;  I
am content to be to myself what I would be.&#160;  What
I choose to seem to myself makes me what I am.&#160;
 My own thought makes me me; my own thought of myself
is me.&#160;  Another shall not make me!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But another has made you, and
can compel you to see what you have made yourself.&#160;
 You will not be able much longer to look to yourself
anything but what he sees you!&#160;  You will not much
longer have satisfaction in the thought of yourself.&#160;
 At this moment you are aware of the coming change!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No one ever made me.&#160; 
I defy that Power to unmake me from a free woman!&#160;
 You are his slave, and I defy you!&#160;  You may be
able to torture me&#8212;&#173;I do not know, but you
shall not compel me to anything against my will!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Such a compulsion would be
without value.&#160;  But there is a light that goes
deeper than the will, a light that lights up the darkness
behind it:&#160; that light can change your will, can
make it truly yours and not another&#8217;s&#8212;&#173;not
the Shadow&#8217;s.&#160;  Into the created can pour
itself the creating will, and so redeem it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That light shall not enter
me:&#160; I hate it!&#8212;&#173;Begone, slave!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am no slave, for I love that
light, and will with the deeper will which created
mine.&#160;  There is no slave but the creature that
wills against its creator.&#160;  Who is a slave but
her who cries, `I am free,&#8217; yet cannot cease
to exist!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You speak foolishness from
a cowering heart!&#160;  You imagine me given over
to you:&#160; I defy you!&#160;  I hold myself against
you!&#160;  What I choose to be, you cannot change.&#160;
 I will not be what you think me&#8212;&#173;what you
say I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry:&#160; you must suffer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But be free!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She alone is free who would
make free; she loves not freedom who would enslave:&#160;
she is herself a slave.&#160;  Every life, every will,
every heart that came within your ken, you have sought
to subdue:&#160; you are the slave of every slave you
have made&#8212;&#173;such a slave that you do not
know it!&#8212;&#173;See your own self!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She took her hand from the head of
the princess, and went two backward paces from her.</p>

<p align="justify">A soundless presence as of roaring
flame possessed the house&#8212;&#173; the same, I
presume, that was to the children a silent wind.&#160;
Involuntarily I turned to the hearth:&#160; its fire
was a still small moveless glow.&#160;  But I saw the
worm-thing come creeping out, white-hot, vivid as
incandescent silver, the live heart of essential fire.&#160;
 Along the floor it crawled toward the settle, going
very slow.&#160;  Yet more slowly it crept up on it,
and laid itself, as unwilling to go further, at the
feet of the princess.&#160;  I rose and stole nearer.&#160;
 Mara stood motionless, as one that waits an event
foreknown.&#160;  The shining thing crawled on to a
bare bony foot:&#160; it showed no suffering, neither
was the settle scorched where the worm had lain.&#160;
 Slowly, very slowly, it crept along her robe until
it reached her bosom, where it disappeared among the
folds.</p>

<p align="justify">The face of the princess lay stonily
calm, the eyelids closed as over dead eyes; and for
some minutes nothing followed.&#160;  At length, on
the dry, parchment-like skin, began to appear drops
as of the finest dew:&#160; in a moment they were as
large as seed-pearls, ran together, and began to pour
down in streams.&#160;  I darted forward to snatch
the worm from the poor withered bosom, and crush it
with my foot.&#160;  But Mara, Mother of Sorrow, stepped
between, and drew aside the closed edges of the robe:&#160;
no serpent was there&#8212;&#173;no searing trail;
the creature had passed in by the centre of the black
spot, and was piercing through the joints and marrow
to the thoughts and intents of the heart.&#160;  The
princess gave one writhing, contorted shudder, and
I knew the worm was in her secret chamber.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She is seeing herself!&#8221;
said Mara; and laying her hand on my arm, she drew
me three paces from the settle.</p>

<p align="justify">Of a sudden the princess bent her
body upward in an arch, then sprang to the floor,
and stood erect.&#160;  The horror in her face made
me tremble lest her eyes should open, and the sight
of them overwhelm me.&#160;  Her bosom heaved and sank,
but no breath issued.&#160;  Her hair hung and dripped;
then it stood out from her head and emitted sparks;
again hung down, and poured the sweat of her torture
on the floor.</p>

<p align="justify">I would have thrown my arms about
her, but Mara stopped me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You cannot go near her,&#8221;
she said.&#160;  &#8220;She is far away from us, afar
in the hell of her self-consciousness.&#160;  The central
fire of the universe is radiating into her the knowledge
of good and evil, the knowledge of what she is.&#160;
 She sees at last the good she is not, the evil she
is.&#160;  She knows that she is herself the fire in
which she is burning, but she does not know that the
Light of Life is the heart of that fire.&#160;  Her
torment is that she is what she is.&#160;  Do not fear
for her; she is not forsaken.&#160;  No gentler way
to help her was left.&#160;  Wait and watch.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It may have been five minutes or five
years that she stood thus&#8212;&#173;I cannot tell;
but at last she flung herself on her face.</p>

<p align="justify">Mara went to her, and stood looking
down upon her.&#160;  Large tears fell from her eyes
on the woman who had never wept, and would not weep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you change your way?&#8221; she said at
length.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why did he make me such?&#8221;
gasped Lilith.&#160;  &#8220;I would have made myself&#8212;&#173;oh,
so different!&#160;  I am glad it was he that made me
and not I myself!&#160;  He alone is to blame for what
I am!&#160;  Never would I have made such a worthless
thing!&#160;  He meant me such that I might know it
and be miserable!&#160;  I will not be made any longer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unmake yourself, then,&#8221; said Mara.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Alas, I cannot!&#160;  You know
it, and mock me!&#160;  How often have I not agonised
to cease, but the tyrant keeps me being!&#160;  I curse
him!&#8212;&#173;Now let him kill me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words came in jets as from a dying fountain.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Had he not made you,&#8221;
said Mara, gently and slowly, &#8220;you could not
even hate him.&#160;  But he did not make you such.&#160;
 You have made yourself what you are.&#8212;&#173;Be
of better cheer:&#160; he can remake you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not be remade!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not change you; he will only restore
you to what you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not be aught of his making.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Are you not willing to have
that set right which you have set wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>She lay silent; her suffering seemed abated.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are willing, put yourself again on the
settle.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will not,&#8221; she answered,
forcing the words through her clenched teeth.</p>

<p align="justify">A wind seemed to wake inside the house,
blowing without sound or impact; and a water began
to rise that had no lap in its ripples, no sob in
its swell.&#160;  It was cold, but it did not benumb.&#160;
 Unseen and noiseless it came.&#160;  It smote no sense
in me, yet I knew it rising.&#160;  I saw it lift at
last and float her.&#160;  Gently it bore her, unable
to resist, and left rather than laid her on the settle.&#160;
 Then it sank swiftly away.</p>

<p align="justify">The strife of thought, accusing and
excusing, began afresh, and gathered fierceness.&#160;
 The soul of Lilith lay naked to the torture of pure
interpenetrating inward light.&#160;  She began to moan,
and sigh deep sighs, then murmur as holding colloquy
with a dividual self:&#160; her queendom was no longer
whole; it was divided against itself.&#160; One moment
she would exult as over her worst enemy, and weep;
the next she would writhe as in the embrace of a friend
whom her soul hated, and laugh like a demon.&#160;
 At length she began what seemed a tale about herself,
in a language so strange, and in forms so shadowy,
that I could but here and there understand a little.&#160;
 Yet the language seemed the primeval shape of one
I knew well, and the forms to belong to dreams which
had once been mine, but refused to be recalled.&#160;
 The tale appeared now and then to touch upon things
that Adam had read from the disparted manuscript, and
often to make allusion to influences and forces&#8212;&#173;vices
too, I could not help suspecting&#8212;&#173;with which
I was unacquainted.</p>

<p align="justify">She ceased, and again came the horror
in her hair, the sparkling and flowing alternate.&#160;
 I sent a beseeching look to Mara.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Those, alas, are not the tears
of repentance!&#8221; she said.&#160;  &#8220;The true
tears gather in the eyes.&#160;  Those are far more
bitter, and not so good.&#160;  Self-loathing is not
sorrow.&#160;  Yet it is good, for it marks a step
in the way home, and in the father&#8217;s arms the
prodigal forgets the self he abominates.&#160;  Once
with his father, he is to himself of no more account.&#160;
 It will be so with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went nearer and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you restore that which you have wrongfully
taken?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have taken nothing,&#8221;
answered the princess, forcing out the words in spite
of pain, &#8220;that I had not the right to take.&#160;
 My power to take manifested my right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mara left her.</p>

<p align="justify">Gradually my soul grew aware of an
invisible darkness, a something more terrible than
aught that had yet made itself felt.&#160;  A horrible
Nothingness, a Negation positive infolded her; the
border of its being that was yet no being, touched
me, and for one ghastly instant I seemed alone with
Death Absolute!&#160;  It was not the absence of everything
I felt, but the presence of Nothing.&#160;  The princess
dashed herself from the settle to the floor with an
exceeding great and bitter cry.&#160;  It was the recoil
of Being from Annihilation.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake,&#8221;
she shrieked, &#8220;tear my heart out, but let me
live!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">With that there fell upon her, and
upon us also who watched with her, the perfect calm
as of a summer night.&#160;  Suffering had all but
reached the brim of her life&#8217;s cup, and a hand
had emptied it!&#160;  She raised her head, half rose,
and looked around her.&#160;  A moment more, and she
stood erect, with the air of a conqueror:&#160; she
had won the battle!&#160;  Dareful she had met her
spiritual foes; they had withdrawn defeated!&#160;
 She raised her withered arm above her head, a p&#230;an
of unholy triumph in her throat&#8212;&#173;when suddenly
her eyes fixed in a ghastly stare.&#8212;&#173;What
was she seeing?</p>

<p align="justify">I looked, and saw:&#160; before her,
cast from unseen heavenly mirror, stood the reflection
of herself, and beside it a form of splendent beauty,
She trembled, and sank again on the floor helpless.&#160;
 She knew the one what God had intended her to be,
the other what she had made herself.</p>

<p>The rest of the night she lay motionless altogether.</p>

<p align="justify">With the gray dawn growing in the
room, she rose, turned to Mara, and said, in prideful
humility, &#8220;You have conquered.&#160;  Let me go
into the wilderness and bewail myself.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Mara saw that her submission was not
feigned, neither was it real.&#160; She looked at her
a moment, and returned:&#160;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begin, then, and set right in the place of
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I know not how,&#8221; she
replied&#8212;&#173;with the look of one who foresaw
and feared the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open thy hand, and let that which is in it
go.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A fierce refusal seemed to struggle
for passage, but she kept it prisoned.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; she said.&#160;
 &#8220;I have no longer the power.&#160;  Open it for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She held out the offending hand.&#160;
 It was more a paw than a hand.&#160;  It seemed to
me plain that she could not open it.</p>

<p>Mara did not even look at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must open it yourself,&#8221; she said
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you I cannot!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You can if you will&#8212;&#173;not
indeed at once, but by persistent effort.&#160; What
you have done, you do not yet wish undone&#8212;&#173;do
not yet intend to undo!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You think so, I dare say,&#8221;
rejoined the princess with a flash of insolence, &#8220;but
I <i>know</i> that I cannot open my hand!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I know you better than you
know yourself, and I know you can.&#160;  You have
often opened it a little way.&#160;  Without trouble
and pain you cannot open it quite, but you <i>can</i>
open it.&#160;  At worst you could beat it open!&#160;
 I pray you, gather your strength, and open it wide.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will not try what I know
impossible.&#160;  It would be the part of a fool!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Which you have been playing
all your life!&#160;  Oh, you are hard to teach!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Defiance reappeared on the face of
the princess.&#160;  She turned her back on Mara, saying,
&#8220;I know what you have been tormenting me for!&#160;
 You have not succeeded, nor shall you succeed!&#160;
 You shall yet find me stronger than you think!&#160;
 I will yet be mistress of myself!&#160; I am still
what I have always known myself&#8212;&#173;queen of
Hell, and mistress of the worlds!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Then came the most fearful thing of
all.&#160;  I did not know what it was; I knew myself
unable to imagine it; I knew only that if it came
near me I should die of terror!&#160;  I now know that
it was <i>life</i> <i>in</i> <i>death</i>&#8212;&#173;life
dead, yet existent; and I knew that Lilith had had
glimpses, but only glimpses of it before:&#160; it had
never been with her until now.</p>

<p align="justify">She stood as she had turned.&#160;
 Mara went and sat down by the fire.&#160; Fearing
to stand alone with the princess, I went also and sat
again by the hearth.&#160;  Something began to depart
from me.&#160;  A sense of cold, yet not what we call
cold, crept, not into, but out of my being, and pervaded
it.&#160;  The lamp of life and the eternal fire seemed
dying together, and I about to be left with naught
but the consciousness that I had been alive.&#160;
 Mercifully, bereavement did not go so far, and my
thought went back to Lilith.</p>

<p align="justify">Something was taking place in her
which we did not know.&#160;  We knew we did not feel
what she felt, but we knew we felt something of the
misery it caused her.&#160;  The thing itself was in
her, not in us; its reflex, her misery, reached us,
and was again reflected in us:&#160; she was in the
outer darkness, we present with her who was in it!&#160;
 We were not in the outer darkness; had we been, we
could not have been <i>with</i> her; we should have
been timelessly, spacelessly, absolutely apart.&#160;
 The darkness knows neither the light nor itself; only
the light knows itself and the darkness also.&#160;
 None but God hates evil and understands it.</p>

<p align="justify">Something was gone from her, which
then first, by its absence, she knew to have been
with her every moment of her wicked years.&#160;  The
source of life had withdrawn itself; all that was left
her of conscious being was the dregs of her dead and
corrupted life.</p>

<p align="justify">She stood rigid.&#160;  Mara buried
her head in her hands.&#160;  I gazed on the face of
one who knew existence but not love&#8212;&#173;knew
nor life, nor joy, nor good; with my eyes I saw the
face of a live death!&#160; She knew life only to know
that it was dead, and that, in her, death lived.&#160;
 It was not merely that life had ceased in her, but
that she was consciously a dead thing.&#160;  She had
killed her life, and was dead&#8212;&#173;and knew
it.&#160;  She must <i>death</i> <i>it</i> for ever and
ever!&#160; She had tried her hardest to unmake herself,
and could not! she was a dead life! she could not
cease! she must <i>be</i>!&#160;  In her face I saw and
read beyond its misery&#8212;&#173;saw in its dismay
that the dismay behind it was more than it could manifest.&#160;
 It sent out a livid gloom; the light that was in
her was darkness, and after its kind it shone.&#160;
She was what God could not have created.&#160;  She
had usurped beyond her share in self-creation, and
her part had undone His!&#160;  She saw now what she
had made, and behold, it was not good!&#160;  She was
as a conscious corpse, whose coffin would never come
to pieces, never set her free!&#160;  Her bodily eyes
stood wide open, as if gazing into the heart of horror
essential&#8212;&#173;her own indestructible evil.&#160;
 Her right hand also was now clenched&#8212;&#173;upon
existent Nothing&#8212;&#173;her inheritance!</p>

<p align="justify">But with God all things are possible:&#160;
He can save even the rich!</p>

<p align="justify">Without change of look, without sign
of purpose, Lilith walked toward Mara.&#160;  She felt
her coming, and rose to meet her.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I yield,&#8221; said the princess.&#160;
 &#8220;I cannot hold out.&#160;  I am defeated.&#160;
&#8212;&#173;Not the less, I cannot open my hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you tried?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am trying now with all my might.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will take you to my father.&#160;
 You have wronged him worst of the created, therefore
he best of the created can help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can <i>he</i> help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will forgive you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, if he would but help me
to cease!&#160;  Not even that am I capable of!&#160;
 I have no power over myself; I am a slave!&#160;  I
acknowledge it.&#160; Let me die.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A slave thou art that shall
one day be a child!&#8221; answered Mara.&#8212;&#173;&#8220;Verily,
thou shalt die, but not as thou thinkest.&#160;  Thou
shalt die out of death into life.&#160;  Now is the
Life for, that never was against thee!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Like her mother, in whom lay the motherhood
of all the world, Mara put her arms around Lilith,
and kissed her on the forehead.&#160;  The fiery-cold
misery went out of her eyes, and their fountains filled.&#160;
She lifted, and bore her to her own bed in a corner
of the room, laid her softly upon it, and closed her
eyes with caressing hands.</p>

<p align="justify">Lilith lay and wept.&#160;  The Lady
of Sorrow went to the door and opened it.</p>

<p align="justify">Morn, with the Spring in her arms,
waited outside.&#160;  Softly they stole in at the
opened door, with a gentle wind in the skirts of their
garments.&#160;  It flowed and flowed about Lilith,
rippling the unknown, upwaking sea of her life eternal;
rippling and to ripple it, until at length she who
had been but as a weed cast on the dry sandy shore
to wither, should know herself an inlet of the everlasting
ocean, henceforth to flow into her for ever, and ebb
no more.&#160;  She answered the morning wind with reviving
breath, and began to listen.&#160;  For in the skirts
of the wind had come the rain&#8212;&#173;the soft
rain that heals the mown, the many-wounded grass&#8212;&#173;soothing
it with the sweetness of all music, the hush that
lives between music and silence.&#160;  It bedewed the
desert places around the cottage, and the sands of
Lilith&#8217;s heart heard it, and drank it in.&#160;
 When Mara returned to sit by her bed, her tears were
flowing softer than the rain, and soon she was fast
asleep.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XL</h1>

<p><b>THE HOUSE OF DEATH</b></p>

<p align="justify">The Mother of Sorrows rose, muffled
her face, and went to call the Little Ones.&#160; 
They slept as if all the night they had not moved,
but the moment she spoke they sprang to their feet,
fresh as if new-made.&#160; Merrily down the stair
they followed her, and she brought them where the
princess lay, her tears yet flowing as she slept.&#160;
 Their glad faces grew grave.&#160;  They looked from
the princess out on the rain, then back at the princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sky is falling!&#8221; said one.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The white juice is running
out of the princess!&#8221; cried another, with an
awed look.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Is it rivers?&#8221; asked
Odu, gazing at the little streams that flowed adown
her hollow cheeks.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Mara,
&#8220;&#8212;&#173;the most wonderful of all rivers.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I thought rivers was bigger,
and rushed, like a lot of Little Ones, making loud
noises!&#8221; he returned, looking at me, from whom
alone he had heard of rivers.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Look at the rivers of the sky!&#8221;
said Mara.&#160;  &#8220;See how they come down to
wake up the waters under the earth!&#160;  Soon will
the rivers be flowing everywhere, merry and loud,
like thousands and thousands of happy children.&#160;
 Oh, how glad they will make you, Little Ones!&#160;
You have never seen any, and do not know how lovely
is the water!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That will be the glad of the
ground that the princess is grown good,&#8221; said
Odu.&#160;  &#8220;See the glad of the sky!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Are the rivers the glad of
the princess?&#8221; asked Luva.&#160;  &#8220;They
are not her juice, for they are not red!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are the juice inside the juice,&#8221;
answered Mara.</p>

<p>Odu put one finger to his eye, looked at it, and shook
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Princess will not bite now!&#8221; said Luva.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No; she will never do that
again,&#8221; replied Mara.  &#8220;&#8212;&#173;But
now we must take her nearer home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a nest?&#8221; asked Sozo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; a very big nest.&#160;  But we must take
her to another place first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is the biggest room in all
this world.&#8212;&#173;But I think it is going to
be pulled down:&#160; it will soon be too full of little
nests.&#8212;&#173;Go and get your clumsies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please are there any cats in it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not one.&#160;  The nests are
too full of lovely dreams for one cat to get in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We shall be ready in a minute,&#8221;
said Odu, and ran out, followed by all except Luva.</p>

<p>Lilith was now awake, and listening with a sad smile.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But her rivers are running
so fast!&#8221; said Luva, who stood by her side and
seemed unable to take her eyes from her face.&#160;
 &#8220;Her robe is all&#8212;&#173;I don&#8217;t know
what.&#160;  Clumsies won&#8217;t like it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They won&#8217;t mind it,&#8221;
answered Mara.&#160;  &#8220;Those rivers are so clean
that they make the whole world clean.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had fallen asleep by the fire, but
for some time had been awake and listening, and now
rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is time to mount, Mr. Vane,&#8221; said
our hostess.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tell me, please,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;is there not a way by which to avoid the channels
and the den of monsters?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is an easy way across
the river-bed, which I will show you,&#8221; she answered;
&#8220;but you must pass once more through the monsters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear for the children,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear will not once come nigh them,&#8221; she
rejoined.</p>

<p align="justify">We left the cottage.&#160;  The beasts
stood waiting about the door.&#160;  Odu was already
on the neck of one of the two that were to carry the
princess.&#160;  I mounted Lona&#8217;s horse; Mara
brought her body, and gave it me in my arms.&#160;
 When she came out again with the princess, a cry
of delight arose from the children:&#160; she was no
longer muffled!&#160; Gazing at her, and entranced
with her loveliness, the boys forgot to receive the
princess from her; but the elephants took Lilith tenderly
with their trunks, one round her body and one round
her knees, and, Mara helping, laid her along between
them.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why does the princess want
to go?&#8221; asked a small boy.&#160;  &#8220;She would
keep good if she staid here!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She wants to go, and she does
not want to go:&#160; we are helping her,&#8221; answered
Mara.&#160;  &#8220;She will not keep good here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you helping her to do?&#8221; he went
on.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;To go where she will get more
help&#8212;&#173;help to open her hand, which has been
closed for a thousand years.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So long?&#160;  Then she has
learned to do without it:&#160; why should she open
it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it is shut upon something that is not
hers.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Please, lady Mara, may we have
some of your very dry bread before we go?&#8221; said
Luva.</p>

<p align="justify">Mara smiled, and brought them four
loaves and a great jug of water.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We will eat as we go,&#8221;
they said.&#160;  But they drank the water with delight.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I think,&#8221; remarked one
of them, &#8220;it must be elephant-juice!&#160;  It
makes me so strong!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We set out, the Lady of Sorrow walking
with us, more beautiful than the sun, and the white
leopardess following her.&#160;  I thought she meant
but to put us in the path across the channels, but
I soon found she was going with us all the way.&#160;
 Then I would have dismounted that she might ride,
but she would not let me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have no burden to carry,&#8221;
she said.&#160;  &#8220;The children and I will walk
together.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It was the loveliest of mornings;
the sun shone his brightest, and the wind blew his
sweetest, but they did not comfort the desert, for
it had no water.</p>

<p align="justify">We crossed the channels without difficulty,
the children gamboling about Mara all the way, but
did not reach the top of the ridge over the bad burrow
until the sun was already in the act of disappearing.&#160;
Then I made the Little Ones mount their elephants,
for the moon might be late, and I could not help some
anxiety about them.</p>

<p align="justify">The Lady of Sorrow now led the way
by my side; the elephants followed&#8212;&#173;the
two that bore the princess in the centre; the leopardess
brought up the rear; and just as we reached the frightful
margin, the moon looked up and showed the shallow basin
lying before us untroubled.&#160;  Mara stepped into
it; not a movement answered her tread or the feet
of my horse.&#160;  But the moment that the elephants
carrying the princess touched it, the seemingly solid
earth began to heave and boil, and the whole dread
brood of the hellish nest was commoved.&#160;  Monsters
uprose on all sides, every neck at full length, every
beak and claw outstretched, every mouth agape.&#160;
 Long-billed heads, horribly jawed faces, knotty tentacles
innumerable, went out after Lilith.&#160;  She lay
in an agony of fear, nor dared stir a finger.&#160;
Whether the hideous things even saw the children, I
doubt; certainly not one of them touched a child;
not one loathly member passed the live rampart of
her body-guard, to lay hold of her.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Little Ones,&#8221; I cried,
&#8220;keep your elephants close about the princess.&#160;
 Be brave; they will not touch you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What will not touch us?&#160;
 We don&#8217;t know what to be brave at!&#8221; they
answered; and I perceived they were unaware of one
of the deformities around them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind then,&#8221; I returned; &#8220;only
keep close.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">They were panoplied in their blindness!&#160;
 Incapacity to see was their safety.&#160;  What they
could nowise be aware of, could not hurt them.</p>

<p align="justify">But the hideous forms I saw that night!&#160;
 Mara was a few paces in front of me when a solitary,
bodiless head bounced on the path between us.&#160;
 The leopardess came rushing under the elephants from
behind, and would have seized it, but, with frightful
contortions of visage and a loathsome howl, it gave
itself a rapid rotatory twist, sprang from her, and
buried itself in the ground.&#160;  The death in my
arms assoiling me from fear, I regarded them all unmoved,
although never, sure, was elsewhere beheld such a
crew accursed!</p>

<p align="justify">Mara still went in front of me, and
the leopardess now walked close behind her, shivering
often, for it was very cold, when suddenly the ground
before me to my left began to heave, and a low wave
of earth came slinking toward us.&#160;  It rose higher
as it drew hear; out of it slouched a dreadful head
with fleshy tubes for hair, and opening a great oval
mouth, snapped at me.&#160;  The leopardess sprang,
but fell baffled beyond it.</p>

<p align="justify">Almost under our feet, shot up the
head of an enormous snake, with a lamping wallowing
glare in its eyes.&#160;  Again the leopardess rushed
to the attack, but found nothing.&#160;  At a third
monster she darted with like fury, and like failure&#8212;&#173;then
sullenly ceased to heed the phantom-horde.&#160;  But
I understood the peril and hastened the crossing&#8212;&#173;the
rather that the moon was carrying herself strangely.&#160;
Even as she rose she seemed ready to drop and give
up the attempt as hopeless; and since, I saw her sink
back once fully her own breadth.&#160;  The arc she
made was very low, and now she had begun to descend
rapidly.</p>

<p align="justify">We were almost over, when, between
us and the border of the basin, arose a long neck,
on the top of which, like the blossom of some Stygian
lily, sat what seemed the head of a corpse, its mouth
half open, and full of canine teeth.&#160;  I went
on; it retreated, then drew aside.&#160;  The lady
stepped on the firm land, but the leopardess between
us, roused once more, turned, and flew at the throat
of the terror.&#160;  I remained where I was to see
the elephants, with the princess and the children,
safe on the bank.&#160;  Then I turned to look after
the leopardess.&#160;  That moment the moon went down,
For an instant I saw the leopardess and the snake-monster
convolved in a cloud of dust; then darkness hid them.&#160;
 Trembling with fright, my horse wheeled, and in three
bounds overtook the elephants.</p>

<p align="justify">As we came up with them, a shapeless
jelly dropped on the princess.&#160; A white dove dropped
immediately on the jelly, stabbing it with its beak.&#160;
 It made a squelching, sucking sound, and fell off.&#160;
 Then I heard the voice of a woman talking with Mara,
and I knew the voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear she is dead!&#8221; said Mara.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will send and find her,&#8221;
answered the mother.&#160;  &#8220;But why, Mara, shouldst
thou at all fear for her or for any one?&#160;  Death
cannot hurt her who dies doing the work given her
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I shall miss her sorely; she
is good and wise.&#160;  Yet I would not have her live
beyond her hour!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She has gone down with the
wicked; she will rise with the righteous.&#160; We
shall see her again ere very long.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mother,&#8221; I said, although
I did not see her, &#8220;we come to you many, but
most of us are Little Ones.&#160;  Will you be able
to receive us all?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are welcome every one,&#8221;
she answered.&#160;  &#8220;Sooner or later all will
be little ones, for all must sleep in my house!&#160;
 It is well with those that go to sleep young and
willing!&#8212;&#173;My husband is even now preparing
her couch for Lilith.&#160;  She is neither young nor
quite willing, but it is well indeed that she is come.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I heard no more.&#160;  Mother and
daughter had gone away together through the dark.&#160;
 But we saw a light in the distance, and toward it
we went stumbling over the moor.</p>

<p align="justify">Adam stood in the door, holding the
candle to guide us, and talking with his wife, who,
behind him, laid bread and wine on the table within.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Happy children,&#8221; I heard
her say, &#8220;to have looked already on the face
of my daughter!&#160;  Surely it is the loveliest in
the great world!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">When we reached the door, Adam welcomed
us almost merrily.&#160;  He set the candle on the
threshold, and going to the elephants, would have
taken the princess to carry her in; but she repulsed
him, and pushing her elephants asunder, stood erect
between them.&#160;  They walked from beside her, and
left her with him who had been her husband&#8212;&#173;ashamed
indeed of her gaunt uncomeliness, but unsubmissive.&#160;
He stood with a welcome in his eyes that shone through
their severity.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have long waited for thee, Lilith!&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>She returned him no answer.</p>

<p>Eve and her daughter came to the door.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The mortal foe of my children!&#8221;
murmured Eve, standing radiant in her beauty.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your children are no longer
in her danger,&#8221; said Mara; &#8220;she has turned
from evil.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Trust her not hastily, Mara,&#8221;
answered her mother; &#8220;she has deceived a multitude!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But you will open to her the
mirror of the Law of Liberty, mother, that she may
go into it, and abide in it!&#160;  She consents to
open her hand and restore:&#160; will not the great
Father restore her to inheritance with His other children?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not know Him!&#8221; murmured
Lilith, in a voice of fear and doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore it is that thou art miserable,&#8221;
said Adam.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will go back whence I came!&#8221;
she cried, and turned, wringing her hands, to depart.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is indeed what I would
have thee do, where I would have thee go&#8212;&#173;to
Him from whom thou camest!&#160;  In thy agony didst
thou not cry out for Him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cried out for Death&#8212;&#173;to escape
Him and thee!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Death is even now on his way
to lead thee to Him.&#160;  Thou knowest neither Death
nor the Life that dwells in Death!&#160;  Both befriend
thee.&#160; I am dead, and would see thee dead, for
I live and love thee.&#160;  Thou art weary and heavy-laden:&#160;
art thou not ashamed?&#160;  Is not the being thou
hast corrupted become to thee at length an evil thing?&#160;
 Wouldst thou yet live on in disgrace eternal?&#160;
 Cease thou canst not:&#160; wilt thou not be restored
and <i>be</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood silent with bowed head.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Mara, &#8220;take
her in thine arms, and carry her to her couch.&#160;
 There she will open her hand, and die into life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will walk,&#8221; said the princess.</p>

<p align="justify">Adam turned and led the way.&#160;
 The princess walked feebly after him into the cottage.</p>

<p align="justify">Then Eve came out to me where I sat
with Lona in my bosom.&#160;  She reached up her arms,
took her from me, and carried her in.&#160;  I dismounted,
and the children also.&#160;  The horse and the elephants
stood shivering; Mara patted and stroked them every
one; they lay down and fell asleep.&#160;  She led
us into the cottage, and gave the Little Ones of the
bread and wine on the table.&#160;  Adam and Lilith
were standing there together, but silent both.</p>

<p align="justify">Eve came from the chamber of death,
where she had laid Lona down, and offered of the bread
and wine to the princess.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Thy beauty slays me!&#160; 
It is death I would have, not food!&#8221; said Lilith,
and turned from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;This food will help thee to die,&#8221; answered
Eve.</p>

<p>But Lilith would not taste of it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If thou wilt nor eat nor drink,
Lilith,&#8221; said Adam, &#8220;come and see the
place where thou shalt lie in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He led the way through the door of
death, and she followed submissive.&#160;  But when
her foot crossed the threshold she drew it back, and
pressed her hand to her bosom, struck through with
the cold immortal.</p>

<p align="justify">A wild blast fell roaring on the roof,
and died away in a moan.&#160; She stood ghastly with
terror.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is he!&#8221; said her voiceless
lips:&#160; I read their motion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, princess!&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great Shadow,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Here he cannot enter,&#8221;
said Adam.&#160;  &#8220;Here he can hurt no one.&#160;
 Over him also is power given me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Are the children in the house?&#8221;
asked Lilith, and at the word the heart of Eve began
to love her.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He never dared touch a child,&#8221;
she said.&#160;  &#8220;Nor have you either ever hurt
a child.&#160;  Your own daughter you have but sent
into the loveliest sleep, for she was already a long
time dead when you slew her.&#160;  And now Death shall
be the atonemaker; you shall sleep together.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Wife,&#8221; said Adam, &#8220;let
us first put the children to bed, that she may see
them safe!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He came back to fetch them.&#160; 
As soon as he was gone, the princess knelt to Eve,
clasped her knees, and said,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Beautiful Eve, persuade your
husband to kill me:&#160; to you he will listen!&#160;
 Indeed I would but cannot open my hand.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You cannot die without opening
it.&#160;  To kill you would not serve you,&#8221;
answered Eve.&#160;  &#8220;But indeed he cannot! no
one can kill you but the Shadow; and whom he kills
never knows she is dead, but lives to do his will,
and thinks she is doing her own.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Show me then to my grave; I
am so weary I can live no longer.&#160;  I must go
to the Shadow&#8212;&#173;yet I would not!&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not, could not understand!</p>

<p align="justify">She struggled to rise, but fell at
the feet of Eve.&#160;  The Mother lifted, and carried
her inward.</p>

<p align="justify">I followed Adam and Mara and the children
into the chamber of death.&#160; We passed Eve with
Lilith in her arms, and went farther in.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You shall not go to the Shadow,&#8221;
I heard Eve say, as we passed them.&#160;  &#8220;Even
now is his head under my heel!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The dim light in Adam&#8217;s hand
glimmered on the sleeping faces, and as he went on,
the darkness closed over them.&#160;  The very air seemed
dead:&#160; was it because none of the sleepers breathed
it?&#160;  Profoundest sleep filled the wide place.&#160;
 It was as if not one had waked since last I was there,
for the forms I had then noted lay there still.&#160;
My father was just as I had left him, save that he
seemed yet nearer to a perfect peace.&#160;  The woman
beside him looked younger.</p>

<p align="justify">The darkness, the cold, the silence,
the still air, the faces of the lovely dead, made
the hearts of the children beat softly, but their
little tongues would talk&#8212;&#173;with low, hushed
voices.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What a curious place to sleep
in!&#8221; said one, &#8220;I would rather be in my
nest!&#8221; &#8220;It is <i>so</i> cold!&#8221; said
another.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, it is cold,&#8221; answered
our host; &#8220;but you will not be cold in your
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Where are our nests?&#8221;
asked more than one, looking round and seeing no couch
unoccupied.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Find places, and sleep where
you choose,&#8221; replied Adam.</p>

<p align="justify">Instantly they scattered, advancing
fearlessly beyond the light, but we still heard their
gentle voices, and it was plain they saw where I could
not.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried one, &#8220;here
is such a beautiful lady!&#8212;&#173;may I sleep beside
her?&#160;  I will creep in quietly, and not wake her.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, you may,&#8221; answered
the voice of Eve behind us; and we came to the couch
while the little fellow was yet creeping slowly and
softly under the sheet.&#160;  He laid his head beside
the lady&#8217;s, looked up at us, and was still.&#160;
 His eyelids fell; he was asleep.</p>

<p align="justify">We went a little farther, and there
was another who had climbed up on the couch of a woman.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mother! mother!&#8221; he cried,
kneeling over her, his face close to hers.  &#8220;&#8212;&#173;She&#8217;s
so cold she can&#8217;t speak,&#8221; he said, looking
up to us; &#8220;but I will soon make her warm!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He lay down, and pressing close to
her, put his little arm over her.&#160; In an instant
he too was asleep, smiling an absolute content.</p>

<p align="justify">We came to a third Little One; it
was Luva.&#160;  She stood on tiptoe, leaning over
the edge of a couch.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My own mother wouldn&#8217;t
have me,&#8221; she said softly:&#160; &#8220;will you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Receiving no reply, she looked up
at Eve.&#160;  The great mother lifted her to the couch,
and she got at once under the snowy covering.</p>

<p align="justify">Each of the Little Ones had by this
time, except three of the boys, found at least an
unobjecting bedfellow, and lay still and white beside
a still, white woman.&#160;  The little orphans had
adopted mothers!&#160;  One tiny girl had chosen a
father to sleep with, and that was mine.&#160;  A boy
lay by the side of the beautiful matron with the slow-healing
hand.&#160;  On the middle one of the three couches
hitherto unoccupied, lay Lona.</p>

<p align="justify">Eve set Lilith down beside it.&#160;
 Adam pointed to the vacant couch on Lona&#8217;s
right hand, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Lilith, is the bed I have prepared for
you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She glanced at her daughter lying
before her like a statue carved in semi-transparent
alabaster, and shuddered from head to foot.&#160;  &#8220;How
cold it is!&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You will soon begin to find
comfort in the cold,&#8221; answered Adam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promises to the dying are easy!&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I know it:&#160; I too have slept.&#160;
 I am dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believed you dead long ago; but I see you
alive!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;More alive than you know, or
are able to understand.&#160;  I was scarce alive when
first you knew me.&#160;  Now I have slept, and am awake;
I am dead, and live indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I fear that child,&#8221; she
said, pointing to Lona:&#160; &#8220;she will rise and
terrify me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is dreaming love to you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But the Shadow!&#8221; she
moaned; &#8220;I fear the Shadow! he will be wroth
with me!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He at sight of whom the horses
of heaven start and rear, dares not disturb one dream
in this quiet chamber!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall dream then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That I cannot tell, but none
<i>he</i> can enter into.&#160;  When the Shadow comes
here, it will be to lie down and sleep also.&#8212;&#173;His
hour will come, and he knows it will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long shall I sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and he will be the last to wake in the
morning of the universe.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The princess lay down, drew the sheet
over her, stretched herself out straight, and lay
still with open eyes.</p>

<p>Adam turned to his daughter.&#160;  She drew near.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Lilith,&#8221; said Mara, &#8220;you
will not sleep, if you lie there a thousand years,
until you have opened your hand, and yielded that which
is not yours to give or to withhold.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; she answered.&#160;
 &#8220;I would if I could, and gladly, for I am weary,
and the shadows of death are gathering about me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They will gather and gather,
but they cannot infold you while yet your hand remains
unopened.&#160;  You may think you are dead, but it
will be only a dream; you may think you have come
awake, but it will still be only a dream.&#160;  Open
your hand, and you will sleep indeed&#8212;&#173;then
wake indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am trying hard, but the fingers
have grown together and into the palm.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I pray you put forth the strength
of your will.&#160;  For the love of life, draw together
your forces and break its bonds!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have struggled in vain; I
can do no more.&#160;  I am very weary, and sleep lies
heavy upon my lids.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The moment you open your hand,
you will sleep.&#160;  Open it, and make an end.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A tinge of colour arose in the parchment-like
face; the contorted hand trembled with agonised effort.&#160;
 Mara took it, and sought to aid her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold, Mara!&#8221; cried her father.&#160; 
&#8220;There is danger!&#8221;</p>

<p>The princess turned her eyes upon Eve, beseechingly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There was a sword I once saw
in your husband&#8217;s hands,&#8221; she murmured.&#160;
&#8220;I fled when I saw it.&#160;  I heard him who
bore it say it would divide whatever was not one and
indivisible!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have the sword,&#8221; said
Adam.&#160;  &#8220;The angel gave it me when he left
the gate.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Bring it, Adam,&#8221; pleaded
Lilith, &#8220;and cut me off this hand that I may
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>He gave the candle to Eve, and went.&#160;  The princess
closed her eyes.</p>

<p align="justify">In a few minutes Adam returned with
an ancient weapon in his hand.&#160; The scabbard looked
like vellum grown dark with years, but the hilt shone
like gold that nothing could tarnish.&#160;  He drew
out the blade.&#160; It flashed like a pale blue northern
streamer, and the light of it made the princess open
her eyes.&#160;  She saw the sword, shuddered, and
held out her hand.&#160;  Adam took it.&#160;  The sword
gleamed once, there was one little gush of blood,
and he laid the severed hand in Mara&#8217;s lap.&#160;
 Lilith had given one moan, and was already fast asleep.&#160;
 Mara covered the arm with the sheet, and the three
turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you not dress the wound?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A wound from that sword,&#8221;
answered Adam, &#8220;needs no dressing.&#160;  It
is healing and not hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor lady!&#8221; I said, &#8220;she will wake
with but one hand!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Where the dead deformity clung,&#8221;
replied Mara, &#8220;the true, lovely hand is already
growing.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We heard a childish voice behind us,
and turned again.&#160;  The candle in Eve&#8217;s
hand shone on the sleeping face of Lilith, and the
waking faces of the three Little Ones, grouped on
the other side of her couch.&#160; &#8220;How beautiful
she is grown!&#8221; said one of them.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Poor princess!&#8221; said
another; &#8220;I will sleep with her.&#160;  She will
not bite any more!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As he spoke he climbed into her bed,
and was immediately fast asleep.&#160; Eve covered
him with the sheet.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will go on her other side,&#8221;
said the third.&#160;  &#8220;She shall have two to
kiss her when she wakes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am left alone!&#8221; said the first
mournfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will put you to bed,&#8221; said Eve.</p>

<p>She gave the candle to her husband, and led the child
away.</p>

<p align="justify">We turned once more to go back to
the cottage.&#160;  I was very sad, for no one had
offered me a place in the house of the dead.&#160; 
Eve joined us as we went, and walked on before with
her husband.&#160;  Mara by my side carried the hand
of Lilith in the lap of her robe.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, you have found her!&#8221;
we heard Eve say as we stepped into the cottage.</p>

<p align="justify">The door stood open; two elephant-trunks
came through it out of the night beyond.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I sent them with the lantern,&#8221;
she went on to her husband, &#8220;to look for Mara&#8217;s
leopardess:&#160; they have brought her.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I followed Adam to the door, and between
us we took the white creature from the elephants,
and carried her to the chamber we had just left, the
women preceding us, Eve with the light, and Mara still
carrying the hand.&#160;  There we laid the beauty across
the feet of the princess, her fore-paws outstretched,
and her head couching between them.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XLI</h1>

<p><b>I AM SENT</b></p>

<p>Then I turned and said to Eve,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mother, one couch next to Lona
is empty:&#160; I know I am unworthy, but may I not
sleep this night in your chamber with my dead?&#160;
 Will you not pardon both my cowardice and my self-confidence,
and take me in?&#160; I give me up.&#160;  I am sick
of myself, and would fain sleep the sleep!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The couch next to Lona is the
one already prepared for you,&#8221; she answered;
&#8220;but something waits to be done ere you sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know you can do it?&#8221; she asked
with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you require it,&#8221; I answered.&#160;
 &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to Adam:&#160;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he forgiven, husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then tell him what he has to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adam turned to his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me that hand, Mara, my child.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held it out to him in her lap.&#160;  He took it
tenderly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Let us go to the cottage,&#8221;
he said to me; &#8220;there I will instruct you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As we went, again arose a sudden stormful
blast, mingled with a great flapping on the roof,
but it died away as before in a deep moan.</p>

<p align="justify">When the door of the death-chamber
was closed behind us, Adam seated himself, and I stood
before him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You will remember,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;how, after leaving my daughter&#8217;s
house, you came to a dry rock, bearing the marks of
an ancient cataract; you climbed that rock, and found
a sandy desert:&#160; go to that rock now, and from
its summit walk deep into the desert.&#160;  But go
not many steps ere you lie down, and listen with your
head on the sand.&#160;  If you hear the murmur of
water beneath, go a little farther, and listen again.&#160;
 If you still hear the sound, you are in the right
direction.&#160;  Every few yards you must stop, lie
down, and hearken.&#160;  If, listening thus, at any
time you hear no sound of water, you are out of the
way, and must hearken in every direction until you
hear it again.&#160;  Keeping with the sound, and careful
not to retrace your steps, you will soon hear it louder,
and the growing sound will lead you to where it is
loudest:&#160; that is the spot you seek.&#160;  There
dig with the spade I will give you, and dig until you
come to moisture:&#160; in it lay the hand, cover it
to the level of the desert, and come home.&#8212;&#173;But
give good heed, and carry the hand with care.&#160;
 Never lay it down, in what place of seeming safety
soever; let nothing touch it; stop nor turn aside
for any attempt to bar your way; never look behind
you; speak to no one, answer no one, walk straight
on.&#8212;&#173;It is yet dark, and the morning is far
distant, but you must set out at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave me the hand, and brought me a spade.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This is my gardening spade,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;with it I have brought many a lovely
thing to the sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took it, and went out into the night.</p>

<p align="justify">It was very cold, and pitch-dark.&#160;
 To fall would be a dread thing, and the way I had
to go was a difficult one even in the broad sunlight!&#160;
 But I had not set myself the task, and the minute
I started I learned that I was left to no chance:&#160;
a pale light broke from the ground at every step,
and showed me where next to set my foot.&#160;  Through
the heather and the low rocks I walked without once
even stumbling.&#160;  I found the bad burrow quite
still; not a wave arose, not a head appeared as I
crossed it.</p>

<p align="justify">A moon came, and herself showed me
the easy way:&#160; toward morning I was almost over
the dry channels of the first branch of the river-bed,
and not far, I judged, from Mara&#8217;s cottage.</p>

<p align="justify">The moon was very low, and the sun
not yet up, when I saw before me in the path, here
narrowed by rocks, a figure covered from head to foot
as with a veil of moonlit mist.&#160;  I kept on my
way as if I saw nothing.&#160;  The figure threw aside
its veil.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Have you forgotten me already?&#8221;
said the princess&#8212;&#173;or what seemed she.</p>

<p>I neither hesitated nor answered; I walked straight
on.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You meant then to leave me
in that horrible sepulchre!&#160;  Do you not yet understand
that where I please to be, there I am?&#160;  Take my
hand:&#160; I am alive as you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I was on the point of saying, &#8220;Give
me your left hand,&#8221; but bethought myself, held
my peace, and steadily advanced.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Give me my hand,&#8221; she
suddenly shrieked, &#8220;or I will tear you in pieces:&#160;
you are mine!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She flung herself upon me.&#160;  I
shuddered, but did not falter.&#160;  Nothing touched
me, and I saw her no more.</p>

<p align="justify">With measured tread along the path,
filling it for some distance, came a body of armed
men.&#160;  I walked through them&#8212;&#173;nor know
whether they gave way to me, or were bodiless things.&#160;
 But they turned and followed me; I heard and felt
their march at my very heels; but I cast no look behind,
and the sound of their steps and the clash of their
armour died away.</p>

<p align="justify">A little farther on, the moon being
now close to the horizon and the way in deep shadow,
I descried, seated where the path was so narrow that
I could not pass her, a woman with muffled face.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you
are come at last!&#160;  I have waited here for you
an hour or more!&#160;  You have done well!&#160;  Your
trial is over.&#160;  My father sent me to meet you
that you might have a little rest on the way.&#160;
Give me your charge, and lay your head in my lap; I
will take good care of both until the sun is well
risen.&#160;  I am not bitterness always, neither to
all men!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Her words were terrible with temptation,
for I was very weary.&#160;  And what more likely to
be true!&#160;  If I were, through slavish obedience
to the letter of the command and lack of pure insight,
to trample under my feet the very person of the Lady
of Sorrow!&#160;  My heart grew faint at the thought,
then beat as if it would burst my bosom.</p>

<p align="justify">Nevertheless my will hardened itself
against my heart, and my step did not falter.&#160;
 I took my tongue between my teeth lest I should unawares
answer, and kept on my way.&#160;  If Adam had sent
her, he could not complain that I would not heed her!&#160;
 Nor would the Lady of Sorrow love me the less that
even she had not been able to turn me aside!</p>

<p align="justify">Just ere I reached the phantom, she
pulled the covering from her face:&#160; great indeed
was her loveliness, but those were not Mara&#8217;s
eyes! no lie could truly or for long imitate them!&#160;
 I advanced as if the thing were not there, and my
foot found empty room.</p>

<p align="justify">I had almost reached the other side
when a Shadow&#8212;&#173;I think it was The Shadow,
barred my way.&#160;  He seemed to have a helmet upon
his head, but as I drew closer I perceived it was
the head itself I saw&#8212;&#173;so distorted as to
bear but a doubtful resemblance to the human.&#160;
 A cold wind smote me, dank and sickening&#8212;&#173;repulsive
as the air of a charnel-house; firmness forsook my
joints, and my limbs trembled as if they would drop
in a helpless heap.&#160;  I seemed to pass through
him, but I think now that he passed through me:&#160;
for a moment I was as one of the damned.&#160;  Then
a soft wind like the first breath of a new-born spring
greeted me, and before me arose the dawn.</p>

<p align="justify">My way now led me past the door of
Mara&#8217;s cottage.&#160;  It stood wide open, and
upon the table I saw a loaf of bread and a pitcher
of water.&#160;  In or around the cottage was neither
howl nor wail.</p>

<p align="justify">I came to the precipice that testified
to the vanished river.&#160;  I climbed its worn face,
and went on into the desert.&#160;  There at last,
after much listening to and fro, I determined the spot
where the hidden water was loudest, hung Lilith&#8217;s
hand about my neck, and began to dig.&#160;  It was
a long labour, for I had to make a large hole because
of the looseness of the sand; but at length I threw
up a damp spadeful.&#160;  I flung the sexton-tool
on the verge, and laid down the hand.&#160;  A little
water was already oozing from under its fingers.&#160;
 I sprang out, and made haste to fill the grave.&#160;
 Then, utterly fatigued, I dropped beside it, and
fell asleep.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XLII</h1>

<p><b>I SLEEP THE SLEEP</b></p>

<p align="justify">When I woke, the ground was moist
about me, and my track to the grave was growing a
quicksand.&#160;  In its ancient course the river was
swelling, and had begun to shove at its burden.&#160;
 Soon it would be roaring down the precipice, and,
divided in its fall, rushing with one branch to resubmerge
the orchard valley, with the other to drown perhaps
the monster horde, and between them to isle the Evil
Wood.&#160; I set out at once on my return to those
who sent me.</p>

<p align="justify">When I came to the precipice, I took
my way betwixt the branches, for I would pass again
by the cottage of Mara, lest she should have returned:&#160;
I longed to see her once more ere I went to sleep;
and now I knew where to cross the channels, even if
the river should have overtaken me and filled them.&#160;
 But when I reached it, the door stood open still;
the bread and the water were still on the table; and
deep silence was within and around it.&#160;  I stopped
and called aloud at the door, but no voice replied,
and I went my way.</p>

<p align="justify">A little farther, I came where sat
a grayheaded man on the sand, weeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails you, sir?&#8221; I asked.&#160;  &#8220;Are
you forsaken?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I weep,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;because they will not let me die.&#160;  I have
been to the house of death, and its mistress, notwithstanding
my years, refuses me.&#160;  Intercede for me, sir,
if you know her, I pray you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nay, sir,&#8221; I replied,
&#8220;that I cannot; for she refuses none whom it
is lawful for her to receive.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How know you this of her?&#160;
 You have never sought death! you are much too young
to desire it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I fear your words may indicate
that, were you young again, neither would you desire
it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Indeed, young sir, I would
not! and certain I am that you cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I may not be old enough to
desire to die, but I am young enough to desire to
live indeed!&#160;  Therefore I go now to learn if she
will at length take me in.&#160;  You wish to die because
you do not care to live:&#160; she will not open her
door to you, for no one can die who does not long
to live.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It ill becomes your youth to
mock a friendless old man.&#160;  Pray, cease your
riddles!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Did not then the Mother tell
you something of the same sort?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In truth I believe she did;
but I gave little heed to her excuses.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, then, sir,&#8221; I rejoined,
&#8220;it is but too plain you have not yet learned
to die, and I am heartily grieved for you.&#160;  Such
had I too been but for the Lady of Sorrow.&#160;  I
am indeed young, but I have wept many tears; pardon
me, therefore, if I presume to offer counsel:&#8212;&#173;Go
to the Lady of Sorrow, and `take with both hands&#8217;*
what she will give you.&#160;  Yonder lies her cottage.&#160;
 She is not in it now, but her door stands open, and
there is bread and water on her table.&#160;  Go in;
sit down; eat of the bread; drink of the water; and
wait there until she appear.&#160;  Then ask counsel
of her, for she is true, and her wisdom is great.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He fell to weeping afresh, and I left
him weeping.&#160;  What I said, I fear he did not
heed.&#160;  But Mara would find him!</p>

<p align="justify">The sun was down, and the moon unrisen,
when I reached the abode of the monsters, but it was
still as a stone till I passed over.&#160;  Then I
heard a noise of many waters, and a great cry behind
me, but I did not turn my head.</p>

<p align="justify">Ere I reached the house of death,
the cold was bitter and the darkness dense; and the
cold and the darkness were one, and entered into my
bones together.&#160;  But the candle of Eve, shining
from the window, guided me, and kept both frost and
murk from my heart.</p>

<p align="justify">The door stood open, and the cottage
lay empty.&#160;  I sat down disconsolate.</p>

<p align="justify">And as I sat, there grew in me such
a sense of loneliness as never yet in my wanderings
had I felt.&#160;  Thousands were near me, not one
was with me!&#160;  True, it was I who was dead, not
they; but, whether by their life or by my death, we
were divided!&#160;  They were alive, but I was not
dead enough even to know them alive:&#160; doubt <i>would</i>
come.&#160; They were, at best, far from me, and helpers
I had none to lay me beside them!</p>

<p align="justify">Never before had I known, or truly
imagined desolation!&#160;  In vain I took myself to
task, saying the solitude was but a seeming:&#160; I
was awake, and they slept&#8212;&#173;that was all!
it was only that they lay so still and did not speak!
they were with me now, and soon, soon I should be
with them!</p>

<p align="justify">I dropped Adam&#8217;s old spade,
and the dull sound of its fall on the clay floor seemed
reverberated from the chamber beyond:&#160; a childish
terror seized me; I sat and stared at the coffin-door.&#8212;&#173;But
father Adam, mother Eve, sister Mara would soon come
to me, and then&#8212;&#173; welcome the cold world
and the white neighbours!&#160;  I forgot my fears,
lived a little, and loved my dead.</p>

<p align="justify">Something did move in the chamber
of the dead!&#160;  There came from it what was <i>like</i>
a dim, far-off sound, yet was not what I knew as sound.&#160;
My soul sprang into my ears.&#160;  Was it a mere thrill
of the dead air, too slight to be heard, but quivering
in every spiritual sense?&#160;  I <i>knew</i> without
hearing, without feeling it!</p>

<p align="justify">The something was coming! it drew
nearer!&#160;  In the bosom of my desertion awoke an
infant hope.&#160;  The noiseless thrill reached the
coffin-door&#8212;&#173;became sound, and smote on my
ear.</p>

<p align="justify">The door began to move&#8212;&#173;with
a low, soft creaking of its hinges.&#160;  It was opening!&#160;
 I ceased to listen, and stared expectant.</p>

<p align="justify">It opened a little way, and a face
came into the opening.&#160;  It was Lona&#8217;s.&#160;
 Its eyes were closed, but the face itself was upon
me, and seemed to see me.&#160;  It was white as Eve&#8217;s,
white as Mara&#8217;s, but did not shine like their
faces.&#160;  She spoke, and her voice was like a sleepy
night-wind in the grass.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Are you coming, king?&#8221;
it said.&#160;  &#8220;I cannot rest until you are with
me, gliding down the river to the great sea, and the
beautiful dream-land.&#160;  The sleepiness is full
of lovely things:&#160; come and see them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, my darling!&#8221; I cried.&#160;
 &#8220;Had I but known!&#8212;&#173;I thought you were
dead!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She lay on my bosom&#8212;&#173;cold
as ice frozen to marble.&#160;  She threw her arms,
so white, feebly about me, and sighed&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carry me back to my bed, king.&#160;  I want
to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I bore her to the death-chamber, holding
her tight lest she should dissolve out of my arms.&#160;
 Unaware that I saw, I carried her straight to her
couch.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Lay me down,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and cover me from the warm air; it hurts&#8212;&#173;a
little.&#160;  Your bed is there, next to mine.&#160;
 I shall see you when I wake.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She was already asleep.&#160;  I threw
myself on my couch&#8212;&#173;blessed as never was
man on the eve of his wedding.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Come, sweet cold,&#8221; I
said, &#8220;and still my heart speedily.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But there came instead a glimmer of
light in the chamber, and I saw the face of Adam approaching.&#160;
 He had not the candle, yet I saw him.&#160; At the
side of Lona&#8217;s couch, he looked down on her with
a questioning smile, and then greeted me across it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We have been to the top of
the hill to hear the waters on their way,&#8221; he
said.&#160;  &#8220;They will be in the den of the monsters
to-night.&#8212;&#173; But why did you not await our
return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My child could not sleep,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is fast asleep!&#8221; he rejoined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, now!&#8221; I said; &#8220;but she was
awake when I laid her down.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She was asleep all the time!&#8221;
he insisted.&#160;  &#8220;She was perhaps dreaming
about you&#8212;&#173;and came to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you not see that her eyes were closed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I think of it, I did.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If you had looked ere you laid
her down, you would have seen her asleep on the couch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would have been terrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would only have found that she was no longer
in your arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would have been worse!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is, perhaps, to think of;
but to see it would not have troubled you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Dear father,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;how is it that I am not sleepy?&#160;  I thought
I should go to sleep like the Little Ones the moment
I laid my head down!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your hour is not quite come.&#160;  You must
have food ere you sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, I ought not to have lain
down without your leave, for I cannot sleep without
your help!&#160;  I will get up at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I found my own weight more than I could move.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is no need:&#160; we will
serve you here,&#8221; he answered.  &#8220;&#8212;&#173;You
do not feel cold, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not too cold to lie still, but perhaps too
cold to eat!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He came to the side of my couch, bent
over me, and breathed on my heart.&#160;  At once I
was warm.</p>

<p align="justify">As he left me, I heard a voice, and
knew it was the Mother&#8217;s.&#160;  She was singing,
and her song was sweet and soft and low, and I thought
she sat by my bed in the dark; but ere it ceased, her
song soared aloft, and seemed to come from the throat
of a woman-angel, high above all the region of larks,
higher than man had ever yet lifted up his heart.&#160;
 I heard every word she sang, but could keep only
this:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Many a wrong,
and its curing song;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many
a road, and many an inn;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Room to roam,
but only one home<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For
all the world to win!&#8221;</p>

<p>and I thought I had heard the song before.</p>

<p align="justify">Then the three came to my couch together,
bringing me bread and wine, and I sat up to partake
of it.&#160;  Adam stood on one side of me, Eve and
Mara on the other.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are good indeed, father
Adam, mother Eve, sister Mara,&#8221; I said, &#8220;to
receive me!&#160;  In my soul I am ashamed and sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We knew you would come again!&#8221; answered
Eve.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you know it?&#8221; I returned.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because here was I, born to
look after my brothers and sisters!&#8221; answered
Mara with a smile.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Every creature must one night
yield himself and lie down,&#8221; answered Adam:&#160;
&#8220;he was made for liberty, and must not be left
a slave!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It will be late, I fear, ere
all have lain down!&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is no early or late here,&#8221;
he rejoined.&#160;  &#8220;For him the true time then
first begins who lays himself down.&#160;  Men are not
coming home fast; women are coming faster.&#160;  A
desert, wide and dreary, parts him who lies down to
die from him who lies down to live.&#160;  The former
may well make haste, but here is no haste.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;To our eyes,&#8221; said Eve,
&#8220;you were coming all the time:&#160; we knew Mara
would find you, and you must come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long is it since my father lay down?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have told you that years
are of no consequence in this house,&#8221; answered
Adam; &#8220;we do not heed them.&#160;  Your father
will wake when his morning comes.&#160;  Your mother,
next to whom you are lying,&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then, it <i>is</i> my mother!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes&#8212;&#173;she with the
wounded hand,&#8221; he assented; &#8220;&#8212;&#173;she
will be up and away long ere your morning is ripe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather be glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be a sight for God Himself to see such
a woman come awake!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is indeed a sight for God,
a sight that makes her Maker glad!&#160; He sees of
the travail of His soul, and is satisfied!&#8212;&#173;Look
at her once more, and sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>He let the rays of his candle fall on her beautiful
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks much younger!&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She <i>is</i> much younger,&#8221;
he replied.&#160;  &#8220;Even Lilith already begins
to look younger!&#8221;</p>

<p>I lay down, blissfully drowsy.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But when you see your mother
again,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;you will not at
first know her.&#160;  She will go on steadily growing
younger until she reaches the perfection of her womanhood&#8212;&#173;a
splendour beyond foresight.&#160;  Then she will open
her eyes, behold on one side her husband, on the other
her son&#8212;&#173;and rise and leave them to go to
a father and a brother more to her than they.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I heard as one in a dream.&#160;  I
was very cold, but already the cold caused me no suffering.&#160;
 I felt them put on me the white garment of the dead.&#160;
 Then I forgot everything.&#160;  The night about me
was pale with sleeping faces, but I was asleep also,
nor knew that I slept.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XLIII</h1>

<p><b>THE DREAMS THAT CAME</b></p>

<p align="justify">I grew aware of existence, aware also
of the profound, the infinite cold.&#160;  I was intensely
blessed&#8212;&#173;more blessed, I know, than my heart,
imagining, can now recall.&#160;  I could not think
of warmth with the least suggestion of pleasure.&#160;
 I knew that I had enjoyed it, but could not remember
how.&#160;  The cold had soothed every care, dissolved
every pain, comforted every sorrow.&#160;  COMFORTED?&#160;
 Nay; sorrow was swallowed up in the life drawing
nigh to restore every good and lovely thing a hundredfold!&#160;
 I lay at peace, full of the quietest expectation,
breathing the damp odours of Earth&#8217;s bountiful
bosom, aware of the souls of primroses, daisies and
snowdrops, patiently waiting in it for the Spring.</p>

<p align="justify">How convey the delight of that frozen,
yet conscious sleep!&#160;  I had no more to stand
up! had only to lie stretched out and still!&#160; 
How cold I was, words cannot tell; yet I grew colder
and colder&#8212;&#173;and welcomed the cold yet more
and more.&#160;  I grew continuously less conscious
of myself, continuously more conscious of bliss, unimaginable
yet felt.&#160;  I had neither made it nor prayed for
it:&#160; it was mine in virtue of existence! and existence
was mine in virtue of a Will that dwelt in mine.</p>

<p align="justify">Then the dreams began to arrive&#8212;&#173;and
came crowding.&#8212;&#173;I lay naked on a snowy peak.&#160;
 The white mist heaved below me like a billowy sea.&#160;
The cold moon was in the air with me, and above the
moon and me the colder sky, in which the moon and
I dwelt.&#160;  I was Adam, waiting for God to breathe
into my nostrils the breath of life.&#8212;&#173;I was
not Adam, but a child in the bosom of a mother white
with a radiant whiteness.&#160;  I was a youth on a
white horse, leaping from cloud to cloud of a blue
heaven, hasting calmly to some blessed goal.&#160; 
For centuries I dreamed&#8212;&#173;or was it chiliads?
or only one long night?&#8212;&#173;But why ask? for
time had nothing to do with me; I was in the land of
thought&#8212;&#173;farther in, higher up than the seven
dimensions, the ten senses:&#160; I think I was where
I am&#8212;&#173;in the heart of God.&#8212;&#173;I dreamed
away dim cycles in the centre of a melting glacier,
the spectral moon drawing nearer and nearer, the wind
and the welter of a torrent growing in my ears.&#160;
 I lay and heard them:&#160; the wind and the water
and the moon sang a peaceful waiting for a redemption
drawing nigh.&#160; I dreamed cycles, I say, but, for
aught I knew or can tell, they were the solemn, &#230;onian
march of a second, pregnant with eternity.</p>

<p align="justify">Then, of a sudden, but not once troubling
my conscious bliss, all the wrongs I had ever done,
from far beyond my earthly memory down to the present
moment, were with me.&#160;  Fully in every wrong lived
the conscious I, confessing, abjuring, lamenting the
dead, making atonement with each person I had injured,
hurt, or offended.&#160;  Every human soul to which
I had caused a troubled thought, was now grown unspeakably
dear to me, and I humbled myself before it, agonising
to cast from between us the clinging offence.&#160;
 I wept at the feet of the mother whose commands I
had slighted; with bitter shame I confessed to my
father that I had told him two lies, and long forgotten
them:&#160; now for long had remembered them, and kept
them in memory to crush at last at his feet.&#160;
 I was the eager slave of all whom I had thus or anyhow
wronged.&#160;  Countless services I devised to render
them!&#160;  For this one I would build such a house
as had never grown from the ground! for that one I
would train such horses as had never yet been seen
in any world!&#160;  For a third I would make such
a garden as had never bloomed, haunted with still pools,
and alive with running waters!&#160;  I would write
songs to make their hearts swell, and tales to make
them glow!&#160;  I would turn the forces of the world
into such channels of invention as to make them laugh
with the joy of wonder!&#160;  Love possessed me!&#160;
 Love was my life!&#160;  Love was to me, as to him
that made me, all in all!</p>

<p align="justify">Suddenly I found myself in a solid
blackness, upon which the ghost of light that dwells
in the caverns of the eyes could not cast one fancied
glimmer.&#160;  But my heart, which feared nothing and
hoped infinitely, was full of peace.&#160;  I lay imagining
what the light would be when it came, and what new
creation it would bring with it&#8212;&#173;when, suddenly,
without conscious volition, I sat up and stared about
me.</p>

<p align="justify">The moon was looking in at the lowest,
horizontal, crypt-like windows of the death-chamber,
her long light slanting, I thought, across the fallen,
but still ripening sheaves of the harvest of the great
husbandman.&#8212;&#173;But no; that harvest was gone!&#160;
 Gathered in, or swept away by chaotic storm, not
a sacred sheaf was there!&#160;  My dead were gone!&#160;
 I was alone!&#8212;&#173;In desolation dread lay depths
yet deeper than I had hitherto known!&#8212;&#173;Had
there never been any ripening dead?&#160;  Had I but
dreamed them and their loveliness?&#160;  Why then these
walls? why the empty couches?&#160;  No; they were
all up! they were all abroad in the new eternal day,
and had forgotten me!&#160;  They had left me behind,
and alone!&#160;  Tenfold more terrible was the tomb
its inhabitants away!&#160; The quiet ones had made
me quiet with their presence&#8212;&#173;had pervaded
my mind with their blissful peace; now I had no friend,
and my lovers were far from me!&#160;  A moment I sat
and stared horror-stricken.&#160;  I had been alone
with the moon on a mountain top in the sky; now I was
alone with her in a huge cenotaph:&#160; she too was
staring about, seeking her dead with ghastly gaze!&#160;
 I sprang to my feet, and staggered from the fearful
place.</p>

<p>The cottage was empty.&#160;  I ran out into the night.</p>

<p align="justify">No moon was there!&#160;  Even as I
left the chamber, a cloudy rampart had risen and covered
her.&#160;  But a broad shimmer came from far over
the heath, mingled with a ghostly murmuring music,
as if the moon were raining a light that plashed as
it fell.&#160;  I ran stumbling across the moor, and
found a lovely lake, margined with reeds and rushes:&#160;
the moon behind the cloud was gazing upon the monsters&#8217;
den, full of clearest, brightest water, and very still.&#8212;&#173;But
the musical murmur went on, filling the quiet air,
and drawing me after it.</p>

<p align="justify">I walked round the border of the little
mere, and climbed the range of hills.&#160;  What a
sight rose to my eyes!&#160;  The whole expanse where,
with hot, aching feet, I had crossed and recrossed
the deep-scored channels and ravines of the dry river-bed,
was alive with streams, with torrents, with still
pools&#8212;&#173;&#8220;a river deep and wide&#8221;!&#160;
 How the moon flashed on the water! how the water
answered the moon with flashes of its own&#8212;&#173;white
flashes breaking everywhere from its rock-encountered
flow!&#160;  And a great jubilant song arose from its
bosom, the song of new-born liberty.&#160;  I stood
a moment gazing, and my heart also began to exult:&#160;
my life was not all a failure!&#160;  I had helped
to set this river free!&#8212;&#173;My dead were not
lost!&#160;  I had but to go after and find them!&#160;
 I would follow and follow until I came whither they
had gone!&#160;  Our meeting might be thousands of years
away, but at last&#8212;&#173;<i>at</i> <i>last</i> I should
hold them!&#160;  Wherefore else did the floods clap
their hands?</p>

<p align="justify">I hurried down the hill:&#160; my pilgrimage
was begun!&#160;  In what direction to turn my steps
I knew not, but I must go and go till I found my living
dead!&#160;  A torrent ran swift and wide at the foot
of the range:&#160; I rushed in, it laid no hold upon
me; I waded through it.&#160;  The next I sprang across;
the third I swam; the next I waded again.</p>

<p align="justify">I stopped to gaze on the wondrous
loveliness of the ceaseless flash and flow, and to
hearken to the multitudinous broken music.&#160;  Every
now and then some incipient air would seem about to
draw itself clear of the dulcet confusion, only to
merge again in the consorted roar.&#160; At moments
the world of waters would invade as if to overwhelm
me&#8212;&#173;not with the force of its seaward rush,
or the shouting of its liberated throng, but with
the greatness of the silence wandering into sound.</p>

<p align="justify">As I stood lost in delight, a hand
was laid on my shoulder.&#160;  I turned, and saw a
man in the prime of strength, beautiful as if fresh
from the heart of the glad creator, young like him
who cannot grow old.&#160;  I looked:&#160; it was Adam.&#160;
 He stood large and grand, clothed in a white robe,
with the moon in his hair.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Father,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;where
is she?&#160;  Where are the dead?&#160;  Is the great
resurrection come and gone?&#160;  The terror of my
loneliness was upon me; I could not sleep without
my dead; I ran from the desolate chamber.&#160; &#8212;&#173;Whither
shall I go to find them?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You mistake, my son,&#8221;
he answered, in a voice whose very breath was consolation.&#160;
 &#8220;You are still in the chamber of death, still
upon your couch, asleep and dreaming, with the dead
around you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Alas! when I but dream how
am I to know it?&#160;  The dream best dreamed is the
likest to the waking truth!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;When you are quite dead, you
will dream no false dream.&#160;  The soul that is
true can generate nothing that is not true, neither
can the false enter it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But, sir,&#8221; I faltered,
&#8220;how am I to distinguish betwixt the true and
the false where both alike seem real?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Do you not understand?&#8221;
he returned, with a smile that might have slain all
the sorrows of all his children.&#160;  &#8220;You <i>cannot</i>
perfectly distinguish between the true and the false
while you are not yet quite dead; neither indeed will
you when you are quite dead&#8212;&#173;that is, quite
alive, for then the false will never present itself.&#160;
 At this moment, believe me, you are on your bed in
the house of death.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am trying hard to believe
you, father.&#160;  I do indeed believe you, although
I can neither see nor feel the truth of what you say.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are not to blame that you
cannot.&#160;  And because even in a dream you believe
me, I will help you.&#8212;&#173;Put forth your left
hand open, and close it gently:&#160; it will clasp
the hand of your Lona, who lies asleep where you lie
dreaming you are awake.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I put forth my hand:&#160; it closed
on the hand of Lona, firm and soft and deathless.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;she is
warm!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your hand is as warm to hers.&#160;
 Cold is a thing unknown in our country.&#160;  Neither
she nor you are yet in the fields of home, but each
to each is alive and warm and healthful.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Then my heart was glad.&#160;  But
immediately supervened a sharp-stinging doubt.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Father,&#8221; I said, &#8220;forgive
me, but how am I to know surely that this also is
not a part of the lovely dream in which I am now walking
with thyself?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Thou doubtest because thou
lovest the truth.&#160;  Some would willingly believe
life but a phantasm, if only it might for ever afford
them a world of pleasant dreams:&#160; thou art not
of such!&#160;  Be content for a while not to know
surely.&#160;  The hour will come, and that ere long,
when, being true, thou shalt behold the very truth,
and doubt will be for ever dead.&#160;  Scarce, then,
wilt thou be able to recall the features of the phantom.&#160;
 Thou wilt then know that which thou canst not now
dream.&#160;  Thou hast not yet looked the Truth in
the face, hast as yet at best but seen him through
a cloud.&#160;  That which thou seest not, and never
didst see save in a glass darkly&#8212;&#173;that which,
indeed, never can be known save by its innate splendour
shining straight into pure eyes&#8212;&#173;that thou
canst not but doubt, and art blameless in doubting
until thou seest it face to face, when thou wilt no
longer be able to doubt it.&#160;  But to him who has
once seen even a shadow only of the truth, and, even
but hoping he has seen it when it is present no longer,
tries to obey it&#8212;&#173;to him the real vision,
the Truth himself, will come, and depart no more,
but abide with him for ever.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I think I see, father,&#8221;
I said; &#8220;I think I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then remember, and recall.&#160;
 Trials yet await thee, heavy, of a nature thou knowest
not now.&#160;  Remember the things thou hast seen.&#160;
Truly thou knowest not those things, but thou knowest
what they have seemed, what they have meant to thee!&#160;
 Remember also the things thou shalt yet see.&#160;
 Truth is all in all; and the truth of things lies,
at once hid and revealed, in their seeming.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How can that be, father?&#8221;
I said, and raised my eyes with the question; for
I had been listening with downbent head, aware of
nothing but the voice of Adam.</p>

<p align="justify">He was gone; in my ears was nought
but the sounding silence of the swift-flowing waters.&#160;
 I stretched forth my hands to find him, but no answering
touch met their seeking.&#160;  I was alone&#8212;&#173;alone
in the land of dreams!&#160;  To myself I seemed wide
awake, but I believed I was in a dream, because he
had told me so.</p>

<p align="justify">Even in a dream, however, the dreamer
must do something! he cannot sit down and refuse to
stir until the dream grow weary of him and depart:&#160;
I took up my wandering, and went on.</p>

<p align="justify">Many channels I crossed, and came
to a wider space of rock; there, dreaming I was weary,
I laid myself down, and longed to be awake.</p>

<p align="justify">I was about to rise and resume my
journey, when I discovered that I lay beside a pit
in the rock, whose mouth was like that of a grave.&#160;
It was deep and dark; I could see no bottom.</p>

<p align="justify">Now in the dreams of my childhood
I had found that a fall invariably woke me, and would,
therefore, when desiring to discontinue a dream, seek
some eminence whence to cast myself down that I might
wake:&#160; with one glance at the peaceful heavens,
and one at the rushing waters, I rolled myself over
the edge of the pit.</p>

<p align="justify">For a moment consciousness left me.&#160;
 When it returned, I stood in the garret of my own
house, in the little wooden chamber of the cowl and
the mirror.</p>

<p align="justify">Unspeakable despair, hopelessness
blank and dreary, invaded me with the knowledge:&#160;
between me and my Lona lay an abyss impassable! stretched
a distance no chain could measure!&#160;  Space and
Time and Mode of Being, as with walls of adamant unscalable,
impenetrable, shut me in from that gulf!&#160;  True,
it might yet be in my power to pass again through
the door of light, and journey back to the chamber
of the dead; and if so, I was parted from that chamber
only by a wide heath, and by the pale, starry night
betwixt me and the sun, which alone could open for
me the mirror-door, and was now far away on the other
side of the world! but an immeasurably wider gulf sank
between us in this&#8212;&#173;that she was asleep and
I was awake! that I was no longer worthy to share
with her that sleep, and could no longer hope to awake
from it with her!&#160;  For truly I was much to blame:&#160;
I had fled from my dream!&#160;  The dream was not
of my making, any more than was my life:&#160; I ought
to have seen it to the end! and in fleeing from it,
I had left the holy sleep itself behind me!&#8212;&#173;I
would go back to Adam, tell him the truth, and bow
to his decree!</p>

<p align="justify">I crept to my chamber, threw myself
on my bed, and passed a dreamless night.</p>

<p align="justify">I rose, and listlessly sought the
library.&#160;  On the way I met no one; the house
seemed dead.&#160;  I sat down with a book to await
the noontide:&#160; not a sentence could I understand!&#160;
 The mutilated manuscript offered itself from the
masked door:&#160; the sight of it sickened me; what
to me was the princess with her devilry!</p>

<p align="justify">I rose and looked out of a window.&#160;
 It was a brilliant morning.&#160;  With a great rush
the fountain shot high, and fell roaring back.&#160;
 The sun sat in its feathery top.&#160;  Not a bird
sang, not a creature was to be seen.&#160;  Raven nor
librarian came near me.&#160;  The world was dead about
me.&#160;  I took another book, sat down again, and
went on waiting.</p>

<p align="justify">Noon was near.&#160;  I went up the
stairs to the dumb, shadowy roof.&#160;  I closed behind
me the door into the wooden chamber, and turned to
open the door out of a dreary world.</p>

<p align="justify">I left the chamber with a heart of
stone.&#160;  Do what I might, all was fruitless.&#160;
 I pulled the chains; adjusted and re-adjusted the
hood; arranged and re-arranged the mirrors; no result
followed.&#160;  I waited and waited to give the vision
time; it would not come; the mirror stood blank; nothing
lay in its dim old depth but the mirror opposite and
my haggard face.</p>

<p align="justify">I went back to the library.&#160; 
There the books were hateful to me&#8212;&#173;for
I had once loved them.</p>

<p align="justify">That night I lay awake from down-lying
to uprising, and the next day renewed my endeavours
with the mystic door.&#160;  But all was yet in vain.&#160;
 How the hours went I cannot think.&#160;  No one came
nigh me; not a sound from the house below entered
my ears.&#160;  Not once did I feel weary&#8212;&#173;only
desolate, drearily desolate.</p>

<p align="justify">I passed a second sleepless night.&#160;
 In the morning I went for the last time to the chamber
in the roof, and for the last time sought an open
door:&#160; there was none.&#160;  My heart died within
me.&#160;  I had lost my Lona!</p>

<p align="justify">Was she anywhere? had she ever been,
save in the mouldering cells of my brain?&#160;  &#8220;I
must die one day,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;and then,
straight from my death-bed, I will set out to find
her!&#160;  If she is not, I will go to the Father
and say&#8212;&#173;`Even thou canst not help me:&#160;
let me cease, I pray thee!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XLIV</h1>

<p><b>THE WAKING</b></p>

<p align="justify">The fourth night I seemed to fall
asleep, and that night woke indeed.&#160; I opened
my eyes and knew, although all was dark around me,
that I lay in the house of death, and that every moment
since there I fell asleep I had been dreaming, and
now first was awake.&#160;  &#8220;At last!&#8221; I
said to my heart, and it leaped for joy.&#160;  I turned
my eyes; Lona stood by my couch, waiting for me!&#160;
 I had never lost her!&#8212;&#173;only for a little
time lost the sight of her!&#160;  Truly I needed not
have lamented her so sorely!</p>

<p align="justify">It was dark, as I say, but I saw her:&#160;
<i>She</i> was not dark!&#160;  Her eyes shone with the
radiance of the Mother&#8217;s, and the same light
issued from her face&#8212;&#173;nor from her face
only, for her death-dress, filled with the light of
her body now tenfold awake in the power of its resurrection,
was white as snow and glistering.&#160;  She fell asleep
a girl; she awoke a woman, ripe with the loveliness
of the life essential.&#160;  I folded her in my arms,
and knew that I lived indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I woke first!&#8221; she said, with a wondering
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did, my love, and woke me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only looked at you and waited,&#8221; she
answered.</p>

<p align="justify">The candle came floating toward us
through the dark, and in a few moments Adam and Eve
and Mara were with us.&#160;  They greeted us with a
quiet good-morning and a smile:&#160; they were used
to such wakings!</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you have had a pleasant darkness!&#8221;
said the Mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;but the
waking from it is heavenly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is but begun,&#8221; she rejoined; &#8220;you
are hardly yet awake!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He is at least clothed-upon
with Death, which is the radiant garment of Life,&#8221;
said Adam.</p>

<p align="justify">He embraced Lona his child, put an
arm around me, looked a moment or two inquiringly
at the princess, and patted the head of the leopardess.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I think we shall meet you two
again before long,&#8221; he said, looking first at
Lona, then at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have we to die again?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, with
a smile like the Mother&#8217;s; &#8220;you have died
into life, and will die no more; you have only to keep
dead.&#160;  Once dying as we die here, all the dying
is over.&#160;  Now you have only to live, and that
you must, with all your blessed might.&#160;  The more
you live, the stronger you become to live.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But shall I not grow weary
with living so strong?&#8221; I said.&#160;  &#8220;What
if I cease to live with all my might?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It needs but the will, and
the strength is there!&#8221; said the Mother.&#160;
&#8220;Pure life has no weakness to grow weary withal.&#160;
 <i>The</i> Life keeps generating ours.&#8212;&#173;Those
who will not die, die many times, die constantly,
keep dying deeper, never have done dying; here all
is upwardness and love and gladness.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She ceased with a smile and a look
that seemed to say, &#8220;We are mother and son;
we understand each other!&#160;  Between us no farewell
is possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mara kissed me on the forehead, and said, gayly,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I told you, brother, all would
be well!&#8212;&#173;When next you would comfort, say,
`What will be well, is even now well.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She gave a little sigh, and I thought
it meant, &#8220;But they will not believe you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8212;&#173;You know me now!&#8221;
she ended, with a smile like her mother&#8217;s.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I know you!&#8221; I answered:&#160;
&#8220;you are the voice that cried in the wilderness
before ever the Baptist came! you are the shepherd
whose wolves hunt the wandering sheep home ere the
shadow rise and the night grow dark!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My work will one day be over,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and then I shall be glad with the
gladness of the great shepherd who sent me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the night long the morning is at hand,&#8221;
said Adam.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that flapping of wings I hear?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The Shadow is hovering,&#8221;
replied Adam:&#160; &#8220;there is one here whom he
counts his own!&#160;  But ours once, never more can
she be his!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I turned to look on the faces of my
father and mother, and kiss them ere we went:&#160;
their couches were empty save of the Little Ones who
had with love&#8217;s boldness appropriated their hospitality!&#160;
 For an instant that awful dream of desolation overshadowed
me, and I turned aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, my heart?&#8221; said Lona.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their empty places frightened me,&#8221; I
answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They are up and away long ago,&#8221;
said Adam.&#160;  &#8220;They kissed you ere they went,
and whispered, `Come soon.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I neither to feel nor hear them!&#8221;
I murmured.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How could you&#8212;&#173;far
away in your dreary old house!&#160;  You thought the
dreadful place had you once more!&#160;  Now go and
find them.&#8212;&#173;Your parents, my child,&#8221;
he added, turning to Lona, &#8220;must come and find
you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The hour of our departure was at hand.&#160;
 Lona went to the couch of the mother who had slain
her, and kissed her tenderly&#8212;&#173;then laid
herself in her father&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;That kiss will draw her homeward, my Lona!&#8221;
said Adam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who were her parents?&#8221; asked Lona.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; answered Adam, &#8220;is
her father also.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned and laid her hand in mine.</p>

<p align="justify">I kneeled and humbly thanked the three
for helping me to die.&#160;  Lona knelt beside me,
and they all breathed upon us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#160; I hear the sun,&#8221; said Adam.</p>

<p align="justify">I listened:&#160; he was coming with
the rush as of a thousand times ten thousand far-off
wings, with the roar of a molten and flaming world
millions upon millions of miles away.&#160;  His approach
was a crescendo chord of a hundred harmonies.</p>

<p align="justify">The three looked at each other and
smiled, and that smile went floating heavenward a
three-petaled flower, the family&#8217;s morning thanksgiving.&#160;
 From their mouths and their faces it spread over
their bodies and shone through their garments.&#160;
 Ere I could say, &#8220;Lo, they change!&#8221; Adam
and Eve stood before me the angels of the resurrection,
and Mara was the Magdalene with them at the sepulchre.&#160;
The countenance of Adam was like lightning, and Eve
held a napkin that flung flakes of splendour about
the place.</p>

<p>A wind began to moan in pulsing gusts.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You hear his wings now!&#8221;
said Adam; and I knew he did not mean the wings of
the morning.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is the great Shadow stirring
to depart,&#8221; he went on.&#160;  &#8220;Wretched
creature, he has himself within him, and cannot rest!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But is there not in him something
deeper yet?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Without a substance,&#8221;
he answered, &#8220;a shadow cannot be&#8212;&#173;yea,
or without a light behind the substance!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He listened for a moment, then called
out, with a glad smile, &#8220;Hark to the golden
cock!&#160;  Silent and motionless for millions of years
has he stood on the clock of the universe; now at
last he is flapping his wings! now will he begin to
crow! and at intervals will men hear him until the
dawn of the day eternal.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I listened.&#160;  Far away&#8212;&#173;as
in the heart of an &#230;onian silence, I heard the clear
jubilant outcry of the golden throat.&#160;  It hurled
defiance at death and the dark; sang infinite hope,
and coming calm.&#160;  It was the &#8220;expectation
of the creature&#8221; finding at last a voice; the
cry of a chaos that would be a kingdom!</p>

<p>Then I heard a great flapping.</p>

<p>&#8220;The black bat is flown!&#8221; said Mara.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Amen, golden cock, bird of
God!&#8221; cried Adam, and the words rang through
the house of silence, and went up into the airy regions.</p>

<p align="justify">At his <i>Amen</i>&#8212;&#173;like doves
arising on wings of silver from among the potsherds,
up sprang the Little Ones to their knees on their beds,
calling aloud,</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Crow! crow again, golden cock!&#8221;&#8212;&#173;as
if they had both seen and heard him in their dreams.</p>

<p align="justify">Then each turned and looked at the
sleeping bedfellow, gazed a moment with loving eyes,
kissed the silent companion of the night, and sprang
from the couch.&#160;  The Little Ones who had lain
down beside my father and mother gazed blank and sad
for a moment at their empty places, then slid slowly
to the floor.&#160;  There they fell each into the
other&#8217;s arms, as if then first, each by the other&#8217;s
eyes, assured they were alive and awake.&#160;  Suddenly
spying Lona, they came running, radiant with bliss,
to embrace her.&#160;  Odu, catching sight of the leopardess
on the feet of the princess, bounded to her next, and
throwing an arm over the great sleeping head, fondled
and kissed it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Wake up, wake up, darling!&#8221;
he cried; &#8220;it is time to wake!&#8221;</p>

<p>The leopardess did not move.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She has slept herself cold!&#8221;
he said to Mara, with an upcast look of appealing
consternation.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She is waiting for the princess
to wake, my child,&#8221; said Mara.</p>

<p align="justify">Odu looked at the princess, and saw
beside her, still asleep, two of his companions.&#160;
 He flew at them.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Wake up! wake up!&#8221; he
cried, and pushed and pulled, now this one, now that.</p>

<p align="justify">But soon he began to look troubled,
and turned to me with misty eyes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They will not wake!&#8221;
he said.&#160;  &#8220;And why are they so cold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They too are waiting for the princess,&#8221;
I answered.</p>

<p>He stretched across, and laid his hand on her face.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She is cold too!&#160;  What
is it?&#8221; he cried&#8212;&#173;and looked round
in wondering dismay.</p>

<p>Adam went to him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Her wake is not ripe yet,&#8221;
he said:&#160; &#8220;she is busy forgetting.&#160; 
When she has forgotten enough to remember enough,
then she will soon be ripe, and wake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;&#173;but not too much at once though.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But the golden cock has crown!&#8221;
argued the child, and fell again upon his companions.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Peter!&#160; Peter!&#160; Crispy!&#8221;
he cried.&#160;  &#8220;Wake up, Peter! wake up, Crispy!&#160;
We are all awake but you two!&#160;  The gold cock has
crown <i>so</i> loud!&#160;  The sun is awake and coming!&#160;
 Oh, why <i>won&#8217;t</i> you wake?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But Peter would not wake, neither
would Crispy, and Odu wept outright at last.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Let them sleep, darling!&#8221;
said Adam.&#160;  &#8220;You would not like the princess
to wake and find nobody?&#160;  They are quite happy.&#160;
 So is the leopardess.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He was comforted, and wiped his eyes
as if he had been all his life used to weeping and
wiping, though now first he had tears wherewith to
weep&#8212;&#173;soon to be wiped altogether away.</p>

<p align="justify">We followed Eve to the cottage.&#160;
 There she offered us neither bread nor wine, but
stood radiantly desiring our departure.&#160;  So, with
never a word of farewell, we went out.&#160;  The horse
and the elephants were at the door, waiting for us.&#160;
 We were too happy to mount them, and they followed
us.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XLV</h1>

<p><b>THE JOURNEY HOME</b></p>

<p align="justify">It had ceased to be dark; we walked
in a dim twilight, breathing through the dimness the
breath of the spring.&#160;  A wondrous change had
passed upon the world&#8212;&#173;or was it not rather
that a change more marvellous had taken place in us?&#160;
 Without light enough in the sky or the air to reveal
anything, every heather-bush, every small shrub, every
blade of grass was perfectly visible&#8212;&#173;either
by light that went out from it, as fire from the bush
Moses saw in the desert, or by light that went out
of our eyes.&#160;  Nothing cast a shadow; all things
interchanged a little light.&#160;  Every growing thing
showed me, by its shape and colour, its indwelling
idea&#8212;&#173;the informing thought, that is, which
was its being, and sent it out.&#160;  My bare feet
seemed to love every plant they trod upon.&#160;  The
world and my being, its life and mine, were one.&#160;
 The microcosm and macrocosm were at length atoned,
at length in harmony!&#160;  I lived in everything;
everything entered and lived in me.&#160;  To be aware
of a thing, was to know its life at once and mine,
to know whence we came, and where we were at home&#8212;&#173;was
to know that we are all what we are, because Another
is what he is!&#160;  Sense after sense, hitherto asleep,
awoke in me&#8212;&#173;sense after sense indescribable,
because no correspondent words, no likenesses or imaginations
exist, wherewithal to describe them.&#160; Full indeed&#8212;&#173;yet
ever expanding, ever making room to receive&#8212;&#173;was
the conscious being where things kept entering by so
many open doors!&#160;  When a little breeze brushing
a bush of heather set its purple bells a ringing,
I was myself in the joy of the bells, myself in the
joy of the breeze to which responded their sweet <i>tin</i>-TINNING**,
myself in the joy of the sense, and of the soul that
received all the joys together.&#160;  To everything
glad I lent the hall of my being wherein to revel.&#160;
 I was a peaceful ocean upon which the ground-swell
of a living joy was continually lifting new waves;
yet was the joy ever the same joy, the eternal joy,
with tens of thousands of changing forms.&#160;  Life
was a cosmic holiday.</p>

<p align="justify">Now I knew that life and truth were
one; that life mere and pure is in itself bliss; that
where being is not bliss, it is not life, but life-in-death.&#160;
 Every inspiration of the dark wind that blew where
it listed, went out a sigh of thanksgiving.&#160;  At
last I was!&#160; I lived, and nothing could touch
my life!&#160;  My darling walked beside me, and we
were on our way home to the Father!</p>

<p align="justify">So much was ours ere ever the first
sun rose upon our freedom:&#160; what must not the
eternal day bring with it!</p>

<p align="justify">We came to the fearful hollow where
once had wallowed the monsters of the earth:&#160;
it was indeed, as I had beheld it in my dream, a lovely
lake.&#160;  I gazed into its pellucid depths.&#160;
 A whirlpool had swept out the soil in which the abortions
burrowed, and at the bottom lay visible the whole
horrid brood:&#160; a dim greenish light pervaded the
crystalline water, and revealed every hideous form
beneath it.&#160;  Coiled in spires, folded in layers,
knotted on themselves, or &#8220;extended long and
large,&#8221; they weltered in motionless heaps&#8212;&#173;shapes
more fantastic in ghoulish, blasting dismay, than ever
wine-sodden brain of exhausted poet fevered into misbeing.&#160;
 He who dived in the swirling Maelstrom saw none to
compare with them in horror:&#160; tentacular convolutions,
tumid bulges, glaring orbs of sepian deformity, would
have looked to him innocence beside such incarnations
of hatefulness&#8212;&#173;every head the wicked flower
that, bursting from an abominable stalk, perfected
its evil significance.</p>

<p align="justify">Not one of them moved as we passed.&#160;
 But they were not dead.&#160;  So long as exist men
and women of unwholesome mind, that lake will still
be peopled with loathsomenesses.</p>

<p align="justify">But hark the herald of the sun, the
auroral wind, softly trumpeting his approach!&#160;
 The master-minister of the human tabernacle is at
hand!&#160;  Heaping before his prow a huge ripple-fretted
wave of crimson and gold, he rushes aloft, as if new
launched from the urging hand of his maker into the
upper sea&#8212;&#173;pauses, and looks down on the
world.&#160;  White-raving storm of molten metals, he
is but a coal from the altar of the Father&#8217;s
never-ending sacrifice to his children.&#160; See every
little flower straighten its stalk, lift up its neck,
and with outstretched head stand expectant:&#160; something
more than the sun, greater than the light, is coming,
is coming&#8212;&#173;none the less surely coming that
it is long upon the road!&#160;  What matters to-day,
or to-morrow, or ten thousand years to Life himself,
to Love himself!&#160; He is coming, is coming, and
the necks of all humanity are stretched out to see
him come!&#160;  Every morning will they thus outstretch
themselves, every evening will they droop and wait&#8212;&#173;until
he comes.&#160; &#8212;&#173;Is this but an air-drawn
vision?&#160;  When he comes, will he indeed find them
watching thus?</p>

<p align="justify">It was a glorious resurrection-morning.&#160;
 The night had been spent in preparing it!</p>

<p align="justify">The children went gamboling before,
and the beasts came after us.&#160; Fluttering butterflies,
darting dragon-flies hovered or shot hither and thither
about our heads, a cloud of colours and flashes, now
descending upon us like a snow-storm of rainbow flakes,
now rising into the humid air like a rolling vapour
of embodied odours.&#160;  It was a summer-day more
like itself, that is, more ideal, than ever man that
had not died found summer-day in any world.&#160;  I
walked on the new earth, under the new heaven, and
found them the same as the old, save that now they
opened their minds to me, and I saw into them.&#160;
Now, the soul of everything I met came out to greet
me and make friends with me, telling me we came from
the same, and meant the same.&#160;  I was going to
him, they said, with whom they always were, and whom
they always meant; they were, they said, lightnings
that took shape as they flashed from him to his.&#160;
 The dark rocks drank like sponges the rays that showered
upon them; the great world soaked up the light, and
sent out the living.&#160;  Two joy-fires were Lona
and I. Earth breathed heavenward her sweet-savoured
smoke; we breathed homeward our longing desires.&#160;
 For thanksgiving, our very consciousness was that.</p>

<p align="justify">We came to the channels, once so dry
and wearyful:&#160; they ran and flashed and foamed
with living water that shouted in its gladness!&#160;
Far as the eye could see, all was a rushing, roaring,
dashing river of water made vocal by its rocks.</p>

<p align="justify">We did not cross it, but &#8220;walked
in glory and in joy&#8221; up its right bank, until
we reached the great cataract at the foot of the sandy
desert, where, roaring and swirling and dropping sheer,
the river divided into its two branches.&#160;  There
we climbed the height&#8212;&#173;and found no desert:&#160;
through grassy plains, between grassy banks, flowed
the deep, wide, silent river full to the brim.&#160;
 Then first to the Little Ones was revealed the glory
of God in the limpid flow of water.&#160;  Instinctively
they plunged and swam, and the beasts followed them.</p>

<p align="justify">The desert rejoiced and blossomed
as the rose.&#160;  Wide forests had sprung up, their
whole undergrowth flowering shrubs peopled with song-birds.&#160;
 Every thicket gave birth to a rivulet, and every rivulet
to its water-song.</p>

<p align="justify">The place of the buried hand gave
no sign.&#160;  Beyond and still beyond, the river
came in full volume from afar.&#160;  Up and up we went,
now along grassy margin, and now through forest of
gracious trees.&#160;  The grass grew sweeter and its
flowers more lovely and various as we went; the trees
grew larger, and the wind fuller of messages.</p>

<p align="justify">We came at length to a forest whose
trees were greater, grander, and more beautiful than
any we had yet seen.&#160;  Their live pillars upheaved
a thick embowed roof, betwixt whose leaves and blossoms
hardly a sunbeam filtered.&#160;  Into the rafters
of this aerial vault the children climbed, and through
them went scrambling and leaping in a land of bloom,
shouting to the unseen elephants below, and hearing
them trumpet their replies.&#160;  The conversations
between them Lona understood while I but guessed at
them blunderingly.&#160;  The Little Ones chased the
squirrels, and the squirrels, frolicking, drew them
on&#8212;&#173;always at length allowing themselves
to be caught and petted.&#160; Often would some bird,
lovely in plumage and form, light upon one of them,
sing a song of what was coming, and fly away.&#160;
 Not one monkey of any sort could they see.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XLVI</h1>

<p><b>THE CITY</b></p>

<p align="justify">Lona and I, who walked below, heard
at last a great shout overhead, and in a moment or
two the Little Ones began to come dropping down from
the foliage with the news that, climbing to the top
of a tree yet taller than the rest, they had descried,
far across the plain, a curious something on the side
of a solitary mountain&#8212;&#173;which mountain,
they said, rose and rose, until the sky gathered thick
to keep it down, and knocked its top off.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It may be a city,&#8221; they
said, &#8220;but it is not at all like Bulika.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I went up to look, and saw a great
city, ascending into blue clouds, where I could not
distinguish mountain from sky and cloud, or rocks
from dwellings.&#160;  Cloud and mountain and sky, palace
and precipice mingled in a seeming chaos of broken
shadow and shine.</p>

<p align="justify">I descended, the Little Ones came
with me, and together we sped on faster.&#160;  They
grew yet merrier as they went, leading the way, and
never looking behind them.&#160;  The river grew lovelier
and lovelier, until I knew that never before had I
seen real water.&#160;  Nothing in this world is more
than <i>like</i> it.</p>

<p align="justify">By and by we could from the plain
see the city among the blue clouds.&#160; But other
clouds were gathering around a lofty tower&#8212;&#173;or
was it a rock?&#8212;&#173;that stood above the city,
nearer the crest of the mountain.&#160; Gray, and dark
gray, and purple, they writhed in confused, contrariant
motions, and tossed up a vaporous foam, while spots
in them gyrated like whirlpools.&#160;  At length issued
a dazzling flash, which seemed for a moment to play
about the Little Ones in front of us.&#160;  Blinding
darkness followed, but through it we heard their voices,
low with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The beautifullest man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard him speak!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t:&#160; what did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Here answered the smallest and most
childish of the voices&#8212;&#173;that of Luva:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said, `&#8217;Ou&#8217;s all mine&#8217;s,
&#8216;ickle ones:&#160; come along!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had seen the lightning, but heard
no words; Lona saw and heard with the children.&#160;
 A second flash came, and my eyes, though not my ears,
were opened.&#160;  The great quivering light was compact
of angel-faces.&#160;  They lamped themselves visible,
and vanished.</p>

<p>A third flash came; its substance and radiance were
human.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see my mother!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see lots o&#8217; mothers!&#8221; said Luva.</p>

<p align="justify">Once more the cloud flashed&#8212;&#173;all
kinds of creatures&#8212;&#173;horses and elephants,
lions and dogs&#8212;&#173;oh, such beasts!&#160;  And
such birds!&#8212;&#173;great birds whose wings gleamed
singly every colour gathered in sunset or rainbow!
little birds whose feathers sparkled as with all the
precious stones of the hoarding earth!&#8212;&#173;silvery
cranes; red flamingoes; opal pigeons; peacocks gorgeous
in gold and green and blue; jewelly humming birds!&#8212;&#173;great-winged
butterflies; lithe-volumed creeping things&#8212;&#173;all
in one heavenly flash!</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I see that serpents grow birds
here, as caterpillars used to grow butterflies!&#8221;
remarked Lona.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I saw my white pony, that died
when I was a child.&#8212;&#173;I needn&#8217;t have
been so sorry; I should just have waited!&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p align="justify">Thunder, clap or roll, there had been
none.&#160;  And now came a sweet rain, filling the
atmosphere with a caressing coolness.&#160;  We breathed
deep, and stepped out with stronger strides.&#160; 
The falling drops flashed the colours of all the waked
up gems of the earth, and a mighty rainbow spanned
the city.</p>

<p align="justify">The blue clouds gathered thicker;
the rain fell in torrents; the children exulted and
ran; it was all we could do to keep them in sight.</p>

<p align="justify">With silent, radiant roll, the river
swept onward, filling to the margin its smooth, soft,
yielding channel.&#160;  For, instead of rock or shingle
or sand, it flowed over grass in which grew primroses
and daisies, crocuses and narcissi, pimpernels and
anemones, a starry multitude, large and bright through
the brilliant water.&#160;  The river had gathered
no turbid cloudiness from the rain, not even a tinge
of yellow or brown; the delicate mass shone with the
pale berylline gleam that ascended from its deep,
dainty bed.</p>

<p align="justify">Drawing nearer to the mountain, we
saw that the river came from its very peak, and rushed
in full volume through the main street of the city.&#160;
 It descended to the gate by a stair of deep and wide
steps, mingled of porphyry and serpentine, which continued
to the foot of the mountain.&#160;  There arriving
we found shallower steps on both banks, leading up
to the gate, and along the ascending street.&#160; 
Without the briefest halt, the Little Ones ran straight
up the stair to the gate, which stood open.</p>

<p align="justify">Outside, on the landing, sat the portress,
a woman-angel of dark visage, leaning her shadowed
brow on her idle hand.&#160;  The children rushed upon
her, covering her with caresses, and ere she understood,
they had taken heaven by surprise, and were already
in the city, still mounting the stair by the side
of the descending torrent.&#160;  A great angel, attended
by a company of shining ones, came down to meet and
receive them, but merrily evading them all, up still
they ran.&#160;  In merry dance, however, a group of
woman-angels descended upon them, and in a moment
they were fettered in heavenly arms.&#160;  The radiants
carried them away, and I saw them no more.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the mighty
angel, continuing his descent to meet us who were
now almost at the gate and within hearing of his words,
&#8220;this is well! these are soldiers to take heaven
itself by storm!&#8212;&#173;I hear of a horde of black
bats on the frontiers:&#160; these will make short
work with such!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Seeing the horse and the elephants
clambering up behind us&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Take those animals to the royal
stables,&#8221; he added; &#8220;there tend them;
then turn them into the king&#8217;s forest.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Welcome home!&#8221; he said
to us, bending low with the sweetest smile.</p>

<p align="justify">Immediately he turned and led the
way higher.&#160;  The scales of his armour flashed
like flakes of lightning.</p>

<p align="justify">Thought cannot form itself to tell
what I felt, thus received by the officers of heaven***.&#160;
 All I wanted and knew not, must be on its way to
me!</p>

<p align="justify">We stood for a moment at the gate
whence issued roaring the radiant river.&#160;  I know
not whence came the stones that fashioned it, but
among them I saw the prototypes of all the gems I had
loved on earth&#8212;&#173;far more beautiful than
they, for these were living stones &#8212;&#173;such
in which I saw, not the intent alone, but the intender
too; not the idea alone, but the imbodier present,
the operant outsender:&#160; nothing in this kingdom
was dead; nothing was mere; nothing only a thing.</p>

<p align="justify">We went up through the city and passed
out.&#160;  There was no wall on the upper side, but
a huge pile of broken rocks, upsloping like the moraine
of an eternal glacier; and through the openings between
the rocks, the river came billowing out.&#160;  On
their top I could dimly discern what seemed three
or four great steps of a stair, disappearing in a
cloud white as snow; and above the steps I saw, but
with my mind&#8217;s eye only, as it were a grand old
chair, the throne of the Ancient of Days.&#160;  Over
and under and between those steps issued, plenteously,
unceasingly new-born, the river of the water of life.</p>

<p align="justify">The great angel could guide us no
farther:&#160; those rocks we must ascend alone!</p>

<p align="justify">My heart beating with hope and desire,
I held faster the hand of my Lona, and we began to
climb; but soon we let each other go, to use hands
as well as feet in the toilsome ascent of the huge
stones.&#160; At length we drew near the cloud, which
hung down the steps like the borders of a garment,
passed through the fringe, and entered the deep folds.&#160;
 A hand, warm and strong, laid hold of mine, and drew
me to a little door with a golden lock.&#160;  The door
opened; the hand let mine go, and pushed me gently
through.&#160;  I turned quickly, and saw the board
of a large book in the act of closing behind me.&#160;
I stood alone in my library.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XLVII</h1>

<p><i>The</i> &#8220;ENDLESS <i>ending</i>&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As yet I have not found Lona, but
Mara is much with me.&#160;  She has taught me many
things, and is teaching me more.</p>

<p align="justify">Can it be that that last waking also
was in the dream? that I am still in the chamber of
death, asleep and dreaming, not yet ripe enough to
wake?&#160;  Or can it be that I did not go to sleep
outright and heartily, and so have come awake too
soon?&#160;  If that waking was itself but a dream,
surely it was a dream of a better waking yet to come,
and I have not been the sport of a false vision!&#160;
 Such a dream must have yet lovelier truth at the
heart of its dreaming!</p>

<p>In moments of doubt I cry,</p>

<p>&#8220;Could God Himself create such lovely things
as I dreamed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whence then came thy dream?&#8221; answers
Hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of my dark self, into the light of my consciousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But whence first into thy dark self?&#8221;
rejoins Hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brain was its mother, and the fever in my
blood its father.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Say rather,&#8221; suggests
Hope, &#8220;thy brain was the violin whence it issued,
and the fever in thy blood the bow that drew it forth.&#8212;&#173;But
who made the violin? and who guided the bow across
its strings?&#160; Say rather, again&#8212;&#173;who
set the song birds each on its bough in the tree of
life, and startled each in its order from its perch?&#160;
 Whence came the fantasia? and whence the life that
danced thereto?&#160;  Didst <i>thou</i> say, in the
dark of thy own unconscious self, `Let beauty be;
let truth seem!&#8217; and straightway beauty was,
and truth but seemed?&#8221;</p>

<p>Man dreams and desires; God broods and wills and quickens.</p>

<p>When a man dreams his own dream, he is the sport of
his dream; when<br>
Another gives it him, that Other is able to fulfil
it.</p>

<p align="justify">I have never again sought the mirror.&#160;
 The hand sent me back:&#160; I will not go out again
by that door!&#160;  &#8220;All the days of my appointed
time will I wait till my change come.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Now and then, when I look round on
my books, they seem to waver as if a wind rippled
their solid mass, and another world were about to
break through.&#160;  Sometimes when I am abroad, a
like thing takes place; the heavens and the earth,
the trees and the grass appear for a moment to shake
as if about to pass away; then, lo, they have settled
again into the old familiar face!&#160;  At times I
seem to hear whisperings around me, as if some that
loved me were talking of me; but when I would distinguish
the words, they cease, and all is very still.&#160;
 I know not whether these things rise in my brain,
or enter it from without.&#160;  I do not seek them;
they come, and I let them go.</p>

<p align="justify">Strange dim memories, which will not
abide identification, often, through misty windows
of the past, look out upon me in the broad daylight,
but I never dream now.&#160;  It may be, notwithstanding,
that, when most awake, I am only dreaming the more!&#160;
 But when I wake at last into that life which, as
a mother her child, carries this life in its bosom,
I shall know that I wake, and shall doubt no more.</p>

<p>I wait; asleep or awake, I wait.</p>

<p align="justify">Novalis says, &#8220;Our life is no
dream, but it should and will perhaps become one.&#8221;</p>
