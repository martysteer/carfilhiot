Ice Bridge - The Game Concept - Outline
</H2>
I shall try to give a little of the flavour of the game, whose
design is by no means clear to me even yet, though I have
been noting ideas in quiet moments for some time now.
<P>
Basically, it is an interactive quest game - now called an ARG
see <a href="http://www.unfiction.com">Unfiction</a> for co-operating
teams (say 3) of players on the web, but its interactive fiction
roots should be concealed to a great extent.
<P>
Obviously, many individual games might be in progress at one
time, and we might even allow two groups on the same quest
to team up or compete if they arrived at the same point together.
<P>
Importantly, the players would not select their own team, they
would subscribe for a game, and then be told the email addresses
of their playing partners.  In theory, they could tell each other as
little or as much about themselves as they wished.  We, the
organisers, however, would advise them to operate through a hotmail
or funmail address, and to assume a gameplay identity rather than
their own.  A set of pre-prepared images would be available for
players to adopt. If the format of the image were standardised,
players could supply their own.
<P>
Unknown to the players, we might substitute a DM or a 
computer player for a real one, just to spice things up,
and to throw a few fast balls into the arena.
<P>
I envisage a co-operating team of what we would call "Dungeon
Masters", DMs, (called Puppet Masters these days) 
if we were running a Quest or Multi-User Dungeon
(MUD). The DMs would host parts of the game on their own
websites, so that users could see that the game was truly
cross-web, not a single-site adventure game.
<P>
If it's to be a success, I would expect the game to achieve its
own dynamic. Let us say, for example, that a successful
and qualified player might be invited to become a DM. We
will quickly find that which works and that which doesn't,
and the great thing about the web is that we'll be able to
change the game without the embarrassment of a software
re-release, simply by updating web pages. 
<P>
Calling it "a" game is misleading.  There would be a portfolio
of several themes, each of which was being played by a number
of teams at one time.
<P>
Each game would have a dynamic appearance, but would actually 
have a deterministic outcome. This is in common with a modern
adventure game where there may be several paths or sub-goals
to experience in any order, but every so often there comes a 
point when no further progress can be made until a certain
subset of the goals have been achieved. Having passed that
critical point, the possible paths through the game will
diverge again, until the next nexus or the endgame.
<P>
The quests should concentrate on intriguing players, rather
than running them at full speed.  Again, the analogy of the 
interactive fiction game is good.  One's best ideas come
from quiet contemplation, often off-line, of the problem,
and in discussion with like-minded players.
<P>
Each quest should follow the classic format of:
<UL>
<LI>The gathering of the companions;
<LI>The revelation of the Quest;
<LI>Initial failure, perhaps involving the "loss" of a companion;
<LI>Solid achievement against increasing odds;
<LI>Victory.
