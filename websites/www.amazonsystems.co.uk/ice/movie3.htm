Ice Bridge - The Movie Concept - Methods
</H2>
<P>
The following ideas are intended to address some of the
presentation problems faced by filming an essentially
cerebral plot which has little traditional action or
dialogue (where <i>dialogue</i> is read in its meaning
of 'a conversation between two people').
<UL>
<LI>Email messages should be read aloud by a voice-over;
<LI>Since some of the email originators have hidden character,
the voice used should be the voice as expected by the context.
So, if the scene is in the room of a mail recipient, let's say
the heroine, and the message purports to be from a teenager,
then the voice is that of the teenager.
<BR>
On the other hand, if the same message were being voiced in the
lair of the 'teenager' who happens to be a young man, then
the voice-over would be a young man.
<LI>The above means that we can demonstrate the false identity
by jump-cutting the point of view and the voice-over in mid
message.
<LI>Before the identities are revealed, the camera can wander over
the character's room, getting context from books, posters, 
furniture, photographs, clothing, and so on.
<LI>Glimpses of the characters, unclear at first, but
accruing detail as time goes on, would gradually reveal
the companions.
<LI>Further, we can follow the characters from their rooms and
see them in their real lives, to establish character.
<LI>Establishing footage filmed internationally, which an
internet community can easily arrange, would enhance the
impression that the net participants really were all over
the world. 
<LI>Computer screens often look wrong in the cinema. Wherever possible,
we should make sure real screens are shown. Therefore, really
clear Web screens must be shown whenever it is important
to communicate something.
<LI>Reading speeds and literacy vary considerably. Comprehension must
not depend on the audience reading a screen.
<LI>This means, in turn, that we should make the movie
view of the Game very pictorial or auditory - Web Cam views, 
tunnel mazes, trivia questions.
