Ice Bridge - The Movie Concept - Plot
</H2>
<P>
So, returning to the classic plot I outlined in the previous
page, I proffer the following plot:
<UL>
<LI>Initial action to establish the hero;
<UL>
<LI>A young woman - NOT an adolescent - is using the 
Internet in the way of research, and not enjoying it much;
<LI>She observes a girl friend engrossed in a game -
basically a team ARG game like the one I've outlined. She helps her friend with
a problem;
<LI>Our heroine is established as someone who is wary of
personal relationships, by rejecting the friend's 
invitation to join in;
<LI>The friend explains that you never have to meet your
fellow players, just work with them on the Net.
</UL>
<LI>The reluctant hero and his companions;
<UL>
<LI>The concept appeals to our heroine, who subscribes to
the game and is allocated two companions;
<LI>She is amused and pleased by her companions, both of
whom hide behind aliases;
<LI>One purports to be a teenage girl living in America, 
the other a male student in Germany;
<LI>She herself tells the truth about her sex and age,
but lies about her location.
</UL>
<LI>The mission revealed;
<UL>
<LI>They agree on a scenario, and start to play;
<LI>The activity shows in an enthusiasm she has not
hitherto shown for anything, and she begins to
flirt with the student;
<LI>We (the audience) see that the teenage girl is actually a rather
unattractive youth, and the German student is actually an old
man;
</UL>
<LI>Early complications to the mission, and reverses of fortune;
<UL>
<LI>They make some progress, but after a short time the student
makes a fatal mistake in the game, and is taken out;
<LI>She tries to re-establish contact with the "student", and
thus finds out who he really is.
</UL>
<LI>Build up of tension as the hero's plan develops while
the villains also gain in power;
<UL>
<LI>She almost resigns from the game herself, but the "teenage
girl" persuades her to stay, and they are allocated a new
companion, whose rather stilted delivery is puzzling;
<LI>On questioning, the third companion professes himself
to be a computer running a sort of Eliza program (a mid-sixties
psycho-therapy program which could hold a sort of conversation
with the user, building on the replies and echoing the user's
sentiments, as well as having a store of motherhood statements
to spout from time to time);
<LI>They continue to play, with some success;
<LI>We now see that the player representing himself as the 
"computer" is actually a rather
unpleasant person who is stalking our heroine, using clues from 
what she says to find her location.  We see him moving
from place to place, using a notebook computer to make his
contacts;
<LI>We can also see him tracking down the "teenage girl", whom
he kills in anger at the deception.  That companion just
disappears from the game. 
</UL>
<LI>Victory snatched from the jaws of defeat.
<UL>
<LI>The killer should be seen to approach the heroine's
apartment but steps straight into a trap set by the "student"
(the old man)- actually a German cop who has been tracking him down for ages.
</UL>
</UL>
Well, that's kind of it.  I think it requires a lot more, and
perhaps, in some places, a lot less.  I am not wedded to the
plot, but I'd like to ensure that the twists are Internet
based. I'm open to suggestions.
<P>
In the next section, I'd like to suggest some of the ways
in which the movie could be convincingly filmed.
