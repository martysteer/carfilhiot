Ice Bridge - The Movie Concept - Outline
</H2>
<P>
As with games, many successful movies tend to follow a 
classic format:
<UL>
<LI>Initial action to establish the hero;
<LI>The reluctant hero and his companions;
<LI>The mission revealed;
<LI>Early complications to the mission, and reverses of fortune;
<LI>Build up of tension as the hero's plan develops while
the villains also gain in power;
<LI>Victory snatched from the jaws of defeat.
</UL>
I'd go with this pattern.  The challenge is to make an 
Internet movie gripping, and still about the Internet,
and not Cops and Robbers, Cowboys and Indians or
a soppy love story.
<P>
While a number of movies about the net, like the early
<i>War Games,</i> <i>Hackers,</i>,
<i>The Net</i>, and the more recent <I>Matrix</I> series
and their rip-offs
have concerned themselves with Internettish
subjects, they rapidly descended into action adventures of the
more usual kind, and I can see the problem. Computers aren't
that photogenic.
<p>
Further, a high percentage of conventional movies now
feature email and the Web, as a <i>Deus ex Machina</i>
to resolve a plot problem, but my concept would be a
movie that concerned itself very closely with the Internet.
<P>
So, the plot I have in mind is built and played out with
real Internet activities, and with a total absence of car chases,
guns, super-criminals, toilet scenes or vomiting. In fact,
I think all movies should omit the last two. 
<P>
It's worth mentioning here that a number of the computer
movie clich&eacute;s we are accustomed to should be absent:
<UL>
<LI>Where an impossibly fuzzy picture at a very low
resolution is clarified to 35mm quality by a few
mouse strokes;
<LI>Where a complicated database is searched by a new and 
different set of criteria never before tried, by a single
keystroke;
</UL>

In particular, I'd like to see quite the contrary, where fuzzy
pictures just become hopelessly pixellated when you expand them,
where a programmer (who wears a suit and tie and doesn't have
a beard and weird habits) quotes a day or two for some
complex procedure, where the Internet doesn't reveal its secrets
at the first query to Google. And, of course, where computers
are revealed as the literal-minded irritating work-horses
that they really are.
<P>
In the next section, I propose a plot...
