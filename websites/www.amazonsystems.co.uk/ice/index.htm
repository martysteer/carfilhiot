	Ice Bridge - Introduction
</H2>
</center>
This idea grew out of two concepts.  First of all, I
mentioned to a pair of film-making friends, Joe Barlow
and Kevin Darbro of <i>The Wicked Witch Project</i>, that we 
were in the best position of anyone we knew to make the ultimate
internet movie.  Secondly, I feel that the web is
under-utilised as a games medium.
<P>
The result of this is that I started to think of a movie 
concept which would encompass the internet, in which a
game goes wrong, and then I began to wonder how to
deliver an engrossing game on the web against the background
on the one hand of Quake and other arcade-style games,
and on the other of traditional games like Chess and Go
which are widely played across the net.
<P>
My criterion was that the game should be delivered using html,
and perhaps a little Javascript, together with email,
to anyone having a standard browser and email account.
The ideas are not yet fully-fledged, but I can perceive
some considerable potential here.
<P>
The essence of the game is co-operation between internet users
who are physically distant from each other, but work like
a role-playing team in a quest-like game.
<P>
It was not originally envisaged as a money-making project, though
if it became very popular, advertising space could be sold on
it.
