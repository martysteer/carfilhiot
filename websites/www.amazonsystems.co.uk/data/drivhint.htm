<a name = "drivhints">Some Kart Driving Hints</a>
</H2>
<P>
These are not hard and fast rules. Exceptional cases often occur
where it's sensible to jam on the anchors to turn the kart
explosively, or to enter a corner wide and exit narrow.  But
recognise that these ARE exceptions, and the lore below has been
serving me and my team-mates well for a few years.
<P>
<H3>
<a name = "revs">Keep the Revs up!</a>
</H3>
<P>
One of the important rules with a single-gear, centrifugal clutch
kart is to keep the revs up.  If you lose revs, you spend a lot of 
time building them back up, and the power band, such as it is, is
near the top of the rev range.
<P>
<H3>
<a name = "straight">Steer straight!</a>
</H3>
<P>
Because the back wheels are on a solid axle, the best acceleration
is obtained by keeping the front wheels in the neutral position
as much as possible.  In particular, from a standing start, it is
very difficult to get a kart moving if you have any steering
lock on.
<P>
<H3>
<a name = "brake">Brake straight!</a>
</H3>
<P>
Unless you want to create some special effect, such as twirling
on the spot or getting the rear end of the kart round quickly,
try not to brake when cornering.  The brake only operates on the rear
axle, and you will find that it not only kills your revs, but unbalances
the exquisite equilibrium you have achieved.  In general, brake on
the straight before the bend.  It makes sense to feather the
throttle rather than use the brake on a curve when you are on the limit.  
However, rather than lifting your accelerator
if you are entering a corner after a straightish section, it's best to
floor the accelerator until the last moment, brake hard, if necessary,
while you are still in a straight line, and then floor the accelerator again
through the corner.  In fact, it's surprising how seldom you need to brake
on most indoor circuits.
<p>
These are not hard and fast rules. On fast circuits with moderate
bends there will
be occasions when you brake into a bend, giving less brake and more
throttle as you get deeper.

<a name = "sweep">Sweeping Bends</a>
</H3>
<P>
On sweeping bends, karts drive beautifully.  A little tweak on the wheel
will induce a drift, and you just balance the kart between understeer
and oversteer through the bend.  Remember, you are always aiming
for an imaginary apex beyond the geometric apex of the bend.

<a name = "sharp">Sharper Bends</a>
</H3>
<P>
The same trick is much more difficult to do when there's
a hairpin bend to negotiate. You have to induce a little more wheelspin.
The basic method is to brake sharply in a straight line before reaching
the corner, let the revs build up, while turning in, and once the kart is 
sliding and wheelspinning, straighten the front wheels for the exit.
This is easier said than done, of course, but once you get the feel for it,
it improves your performance greatly. In effect, you are trying to
line the kart up for the exit of the corner before you get there.
<P>
Beginners underestimate the capabilities of karts.  You will find
you can dare to go into a sharp bend surprisingly fast, in the knowledge
that the act of cornering will slow you down quite a lot.

<a name="chicane">Chicanes and Esses</a>
</H3>
Chicanes and Esses are multiple bends. While it is impossible here to
cover every shape, there are a few guiding principles you can use to
deal with them. The first important thing to remember is that the 
<I>last</I> bend of the complex is the most important, and that you should
emerge from it at the maximum possible speed. Many successful overtaking
manoeuvres are executed on the exit of a chicane or series of
esses. <P>
Everything else is directed
towards putting you in the best position for that final bend. A line
that is perfect for the second last bend if it were to be followed by 
a straight may have you going too fast or in the wrong position for
the final bend. In particular, many people enter the first bend of
a chicane too fast, arrive at the second bend in the wrong position,
and are out of shape for the rest of the complex. Because you are planning
to moderate your speed within the chicane, you can take the bends
tighter than usual. Remember to use as little steering lock as possible
on the final bend, to help your acceleration.

<H3>
<a name = "fast">What's the Fastest Line?</a>
</H3>
<P>
The fastest line to take on any bend is a matter of experience, but
the basic rule is to set up wide, clip just beyond the apex, and
exit fairly wide. It's my experience that you should not go <I>too</I>
wide on exit. Sometimes this means you still have to use all the available
width, but don't use more than you need, just on principle.
<P>
Start the turn on a gentle bend a little earlier than you'd
expect in a road car, but go deep into a hairpin before turning in.
<P>
That is all very well, of course, if it is sensible to make a wide
approach and exit.  It's no good finishing up on the right-hand
side of the track if the next bend is to the right.  You constantly
have to make compromises, starting a turn from the centre of the
track, or aiming to come out of a curve tight, in order to be ready for 
the next bend.  There is more value to coming out of
a corner fast than going into it fast, if you are trying to put
in a good lap time.
<P>
Having said all that, the fastest line doesn't always win races, and
to deal with traffic, you must learn to corner from all sorts of
track positions, and you may leave yourself vulnerable or unable to
overtake if you insist on sticking to the fastest line.
<P>
<H3>
<a name = "defend">Defending your Line</a>
</H3>
<P>
Defending your line is not always appropriate. You will put in a
slower lap time when you are defending. If you are in the lead,
or in a short race, or near the end of a long race, where
it's essential that faster karts don't overtake or if you only have 
to hold off your opponent for a few laps, then
it's sensible to defend. However, the best way to prevent people
overtaking is to drive faster than them, and leave a gap behind you.
While you are defending, you are not catching the people in front
of you.  In fact, not only will your opponent be held up,
<i>you</i> will be losing ground to the whole field, which is
particularly damaging in an enduro race.
<P>
Assuming, however, that are defending, rather than attacking,
the clue for that is to take a tight line round the circuit,
never leaving more than a kart's width inside you for someone
to slip by.  It is so much more difficult to overtake on the
outside of a bend than the inside.  This means you will only lose places
to people who are MUCH faster than you, and who have the speed to
take you on the outside, but someone who is only a little faster
won't be able to get by.  You can afford to use your brake to help you
round corners you wouldn't normally expect to approach so tightly,
because while you are in the way, it doesn't matter that the kart
behind you can theoretically go faster.
<P>
Don't keep looking over your shoulder to see what the kart behind you is doing.
If you can hear it, or feel it tailgating you, don't look at all.
There are three reasons for this, and one reason would be enough.
<ul type = disc>
<li>Looking over your shoulder means you aren't concentrating on the 
track ahead.  Your business is to steer the best line for the
circumstances; 
<li>If the driver behind sees you look over your shoulder, he
knows you are aware of him.  Psychologically, he may then be prepared
to take a bigger risk in passing you than he would if he thought you
were oblivious of him, and he can also pretend to be going one
side when he means to go another;
<li>Knowing there's a kart behind you and what side it's at
doesn't help you at all.  Time enough to worry when it draws
alongside, and if you are driving defensively, it'll be on the outside,
where he is at a disadvantage.
</ul>
<P>
If the marshals are waving at you to let through a faster kart which
is on a different lap, don't be tempted to drive wide, as the whole 
field can use the space, not just the one who has the right to do it.
Maintain a tight line, and just slow down enough to let him by 
on the outside.

<P>
<a name = "attack">Attacking an Opponent<br>
(In the Nicest Possible Way, of course)</a>
</H3>
<P>
When attacking, the best method is to get up the inside of your
opponent, and brake late into the corner.  You will make an untidy
mess of going round, because you are not using the ideal line, but
at the exit to the corner, you will be in your opponent's way, and he
won't be able to use his superior exit line and speed.  You can use
this method to overtake people who are even a little faster than
you, using your fast approach to the corner to block them in the
corner itself.  This is why the best defensive line is one that
leaves no room on the inside.
<P>
However, beware of the driver who cuts into the corner when you're
close (this is known as "shutting the door").  In order to ensure
the door doesn't slam on you, you must be abreast or ahead of him
at the crucial moment, or at least convince him you won't (or
can't) back off.  You see Schumaker do this in GP all the time.
<P>
If your opponent is taking the corners tightly, but not driving
the perfect defensive line elsewhere, there may be
an opportunity to take a different line through the corner,
so that you come abreast on the inside after the apex.  This
works best if the next bend is in the same direction, as you
now have the inside line if you can hold it.
<P>
Given that your opponent is driving defensively and well, you may have to 
overtake him on the outside.  To do this, you must fall back a little
at the right moment.  If you are too close, you will be limited
to his speed.  Then while he drives defensively round a corner,
you take the fastest line, and if you are fast enough, you can 
overtake him on the outside at the exit.
<P>
Finally, if you can't overtake cleanly, the best course is to decide
which bend you have the best chance of taking him on the inside at.
Then make an effort to threaten him on the outside at the approach to 
that bend.  After you have done this for a couple of laps, he may
be unable to resist driving a little wider to block you, leaving
enough room on the inside for you to slip through.

<P>
Things become more complicated when you are no 3 in a line of karts,
and there's no rule of thumb here.  Everything depends on what the no 2
driver in front of you is doing.  If he's trying to take his opponent
on the outside, there's a good chance you can squeeze past him using
a tight line.  However, if kart no 1 is much slower than no 2, you may
block yourself in, and the best line may be to follow no 2.  This in
turn may make you vulnerable to an attack from no 4 behind you,
who will have more room to work with before he is close to no 1,
and may take you, even if he can't take no 2.

If nos 1 and 2 are having a fierce battle, which may result in a collision...
(you can generally tell when either no 1 is going to block aggressively,
or no 2 is going to take a terrible risk) then hang back a little and defend
your line.  Chances are that they'll self-destruct and you'll get past both of
them.

On a crowded track, it's best to drive a slightly defensive line, as that also gives you 
the best chance of squeezing up the inside of an incautious opponent.

Always be ready for stationary or slow-moving karts in the racing line.  It's
no good blaming someone if you've rammed them.

<P>

<P>
Karting is a non-contact sport.  The best organisers do their
best to keep it that way, by penalising dodgem drivers.
You might think that this
implies you can gain advantage by bumping.  However,
on average, collisions are a bad idea, and not just because
you're likely to be black-flagged for it.  Sure, you might give an
opponent a little shove as he gets to the hairpin, pushing 
him wide, so you can slip through.  But he has to be a novice 
for you to get away with it. Most of us would make damned sure 
you didn't escape unscathed.  When you are making the classic
passing manoeuvre, whether it be inside or outside, it depends
on the driver being passed altering his course or speed to give you
room when it's obvious you've got the advantage.  If you've 
bumped him to place yourself in that position, you can be pretty sure 
he won't give way, and you'll end up being scraped off on the
side barriers, or even T-boned.  You are very vulnerable when
you've just overtaken someone.
<P>
If you bump someone from behind, he gets a little extra speed,
and you get a little less.  Indeed, if you are being pursued
by an aggressive driver, you can take advantage of this by
braking slightly when he least expects it.  You are expecting the
resulting shove, but he isn't.  He will soon learn it's not
going to work.
<P>
If you side-swipe an opponent on a
bend, you are the one most likely to suffer for it.  Tyre to
tyre contact is particularly nasty, as you can be thrown
in the air, and you have no control on how you land.
<P>
If you squeeze someone into the side barriers, you will almost
certainly be involved when he hits the tyres, and the entire 
field will lap you before you are extricated.
<P>
A common kind of contact involves one kart hooking its front
bumper into the back bumper of the kart in front.  This slows 
everyone up, and is usually caused by someone trying to defend
against an aggressive driver who is tailgating.
<P>
Accidents happen, of course, and you should always be looking ahead
so that you don't get involved in someone else's collision.  One
thing that's helped me time and time again is to remember that when 
the track is partly blocked by a kart that's sideways after a spin
or collision, always try to pass it to its rear if you
can, as the next thing it will do is to move forward.  There is no 
reverse gear on a kart!

<a name = "wet">Driving in the Wet</a>
</H3>

Some people say that winning a race in the wet is largely a matter of
luck. But, as they say in golf, the more you practice, the
luckier you get.  So, if you want to be lucky enough to win in the wet,
you must practice. The next time it's raining on the day you
intended to practice, don't stay at home watching Australian soaps.
Get out on the track and get wet and dirty and lucky. In the
UK it is futile to expect dry weather all year. 
<P>
In a straight line, you can go as fast in the wet as you can in the dry.
You just have to accelerate, brake and corner more gingerly.  

<P>
You may have to completely change the lines you use on bends. First of
all, a tight line exerts more sideways force, and you will lose the kart
more easily. Secondly, there may be parts of the track which are more
grippy, but which you never need to use in the dry, because the racing
line has enough adhesion.  

<P>
It is more important to emerge from a corner quickly than it is to enter
it quickly.  Use as little steering lock as you can. Don't brake as hard
as you usually do. There is one exception to this. You are running in to
a bend, and you have turned the front wheels, but the kart is not
responding. It is understeering as only a kart can, due to its lack of a
differential rear axle. Abandon your soft-pedal approach to the brake
and give it a quick stamp. The extra weight this throws on the front
wheels may give them the grip they need to bite and start the turn. You
may have to repeat the treatment. Similarly, blipping the throttle can 
break the adhesion of the rear wheels.  
<P>
Even after the track dries, there will still be puddles as the outfield
drains. Learn where these puddles are on your favourite tracks, and
devise new lines to avoid them or to reduce their effect. Remember, the
wet on your tyres will last for several yards after you have passed the
puddle, and you may spin on an apparently dry track.  

<P>
Learn where the unprepared drivers will spin and block the racing line.
There is no point in driving a brilliant race in the wet if you run into
a stationary kart you could have predicted. 

<P>
Practice, practice, practice until it feels absolutely natural to drive
without grip.  

<P>
Driving gloves may slip on the wheel in the wet. Wear
a pair of rubber washing-up gloves over them.  

<P>
Most kart seats have a drain hole in the bottom to allow water to drain
away. Make sure it's clear. There is nothing so uncomfortable as sitting in a shallow bath
while driving.  

<P>
Sew or velcro a pad of chamois leather to your overall sleeve. Then you
can clear your visor efficiently with a quick wipe. 

<P>
Get a fog guard panel for the inside of your visor, and keep it clean.
