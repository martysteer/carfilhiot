<B>Just in case you don't already know about text adventures, I'll try
to put it in a nutshell.  Text Adventures are to Computer Video games
as books are to movies.  Most of us net-surfers are the kind of people
who like books, so it's not surprising that text adventures are very
much alive on the Internet.
<P>
In a text adventure, the game explains the scene or situation to the player
in words, just like a book, and the player replies in sentences with
his instructions.  In the game, he may use various objects that
he finds, and may move from location to location.  With that simple 
introduction, you'll see exactly what I mean if I just roll out 
<a href= "#example">an example</a>.

You can download <I>Sir Ramic Hobbs and the High Level Gorilla</I> 
by clicking <a href="../down/hobbszip.exe"> here.</a><br>
The file is 164 Kb in size.
<P>
You can download <I>Sir Ramic Hobbs and the Oriental Walk</I> 
by clicking <a href="../down/wokzip.exe"> here.</a><br>
The file is 225 Kb in size.
<P>
Save the hobbszip.exe file in a directory of your choice, then open <I>Windows Explorer</I> in that
directory, double-click<font color=#8B0000> <B>hobbszip.exe</B> 
</font> or  <font color=#8B0000><B> wokzip.exe </B></font> 
to unpack the game, and then double-click
<font color=#8B0000><B> hobbs.bat </B> </font>or <font color=#8B0000><B> wok.bat </B></font> to run it.
<P>
<font color=red> In the latest Windows issues - (Win 7, Vista and beyond) it gets a bit more complicated.
You have to instal <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/" target=blank>DOSBox</a>, which also has versions for MAC,
Unix etc.<p>
Then select a directory to use as DOSBox's home, and download and run hobbszip.exe from the Windows directory. 
First, it complains that the zip is unlicenced, but
you can ignore that and unpack it to your chosen directory. Then startup DosBox, 'mount' the chosen directory
and then type HOBBS or WOK on the command line in DOSBox.</font><p>   

There's a walkthrough file in the WOK package to help you if you get stuck.
It's called WOK.WLK.  This is a text file with just the barest
instructions to help you through the game. With HOBBS, you're on your own.
<P>
These are small games, intended to be playable in a single
session - yet there are more than 20,000 words of text in each, in
addition to the map and puzzle logic.  The example is a brief
extract from Sir Ramic Hobbs and the Oriental Walk.

though much of the detailed text, and all the illustrations are missing,
so that you'll find it convenient and pleasant to buy the book instead..

<H2><center>An Extract from an Adventure</center></H2>
<P>
In this game, you take the part of Sir Ramic Hobbs, who is on a quest
of uncertain objective.  The game addresses Sir Ramic, describing
the scene, and commenting on his actions.  This is a chatty,
satirical adventure.  Many are much more serious.
<P> 
We join the action in mid-adventure.
<P>

This first piece of text only appears the first time you arrive at this 
location:
</B>
</td>
<td valign=center align = left width = 70%>
<B><tt>
<font color=#00008B>
  This is the Great Wall of China.  It is more than a wall.  It is a
  fortified rampart some six meters (that's twenty feet, Sir Ramic -
  (Twenty? That's all your fingers and all your toes)) in height, with
  a pavement on top wide enough to carry a horse and cart.  It has been
  built without regard for geographical difficulties, tends to 
  run along high ground to give a good field of view and fire, and
  it extends a very, very long way, branching from time to time.
<P>
  
  (A very long way, Sir Ramic?  Well, it's further than you'd want to
  walk, so it's a good job this is a magical version of the wall, which
  you can complete in five steps, PROVIDED that you figure out the right
  way at each junction.  And you're going to need Old Moong's Almanac to
  do that.)</font>

This section is repeated every time you return to this location:
</B>
</td>
<td valign=center align = left width = 70%>
<B><tt>
<font color=#00008B>
  You are at a junction of the wall here.  A large letter I is carved
  on the pavement, and the wall stretches off in all four directions,
  snaking over valleys and up ridges till it disappears.
<P>
  There's a cool breeze, but it's bright and sunny.

<blockquote>
There is a comfy armchair here.
<P>
There's a blue book here.
</blockquote>
<P>
</font>
</B></tt>
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td valign=center>
<B>
Then there's a prompt.  Let's suppose you want to examine the armchair,
then you would type: Examine armchair, and the game gives
a full description.
<P>
</B>
</td>
<td valign=center align = left width = 70%>
<B><tt>
<font color=#00008B>
What Now?
</font>
<font color=#008B00>
EXAMINE ARMCHAIR
<P>
<font color=#00008B>
  The armchair appears very comfortable.  It is made of leather,
  stuffed, presumably, with something soft.  It seems stuck to
  the floor, or, at any rate, far too heavy for you to lift.
<P>
  
  Something in the back of your mind is screaming "OH NO ! NOT THE
  COMFY ARMCHAIR !"  But it's probably alcoholic poisoning.
</font>  

<P>
</B></tt>

<tr>
<td valign=top>
<B>
Then you could look at the book, and read it.  It plainly
isn't the Old Moong's Almanac you need right now.
<P>
Note also that the game understands "Read It" as "Read the Book",
as that was the object of the previous sentence.
<P>
</B>
</td>
<td valign=center align = left width = 70%>

<font color=#00008B>
What Now?
</font>
<font color=#008B00>
EXAMINE BOOK
<P>
<font color=#00008B>
  The blue book only has the word "man" on its cover.  One is
  left wondering what aspect of man is about to be considered.
  Perhaps we should read it?
<P>
What Now?
</font>
<font color=#008B00>
READ IT
<P>
<font color=#00008B>
  It is hard to read the book, because Baron Doar has been 
  decorating it with his coloured pencils, and tearing pages out
  for who knows what purposes.
<P>
  
  What remains, Sir Ramic, appears to be a set of instructions
  for the handling of a golden liquid used for "Alterations",
  whatever they are.  Apparently, the subject is to DRINK the LIQUID,
  and then within a very few seconds to say one of the
  Magic Words thus:
<P>
  
  GREP      COMPRESS      VI
<P>
  AWK       BIFF          PWD
<P>
  
  The effects of so behaving were printed on the half of the page
  that the Baron has torn out and, presumably, destroyed.
<P>
  
  LOGOUT appears to reverse the effect of each alteration, which is,
  in any event, temporary
<P>
  
  It would, presumably, be wise to try these out where their effect
  could be observed.
<P>
  
  There are many more magic words, very few of them comprehensible,
  but all have been scribbled out of legibility.
  
  
</font>
<P>

<tr>
<td valign=center>
<B>
Perhaps you're carrying the almanac.  You can find out what you are
carrying by using the word "Inventory".
<P>
Aha! The almanac!
<P>
And so we progress.  What happens in the adventure depends very
much on where we go, and what we ask.  That is why text adventures 
are sometimes given the name "interactive fiction".

<B>
So, let's try to use the almanac for advice here.  
<P>
We know from hints given earlier in the game that there is some kind of
word puzzle in the almanac.  The player is meant to find
the words North, South, East or West buried in the text
in some way, as his guide.

EXAMINE ALMANAC
<P>
<font color=#00008B>

  It's Old Moong's Almanac, whose prestigious title is somewhat
  belied by the fact that it is printed in a rather runny typeface
  on the reverse side of a single sheet of low grade paper.
<P>
  
  It is said to be an invaluable guide to the ever-changing topography 
  of The Wall, though you wouldn't guess it from the tone of the contents.
<P>
  
  However, it is also known to be totally misleading when consulted
  outwith the environment of The Wall.
<P>
What Now?

<font color=#008B00>
READ ALMANAC
<P>

<P>
<font color=#00008B>

  When Lee Kim San, a 40 year old shopkeeper, opened his grocery minimarket
  in Kowloon last weekend, he was horrified to discover a 17 inch dragon in 
  the spices department.  Every time he tried to expel the mythical creature,
  it swallowed another packet of Vencatchellum's HOT Madras curry powder
  and breathed flames at him, scorching the freeze-dried Chow Min With
  Bamboo Shoots.  Several attempts to dampen the chimera's ardour with a
  fire extinguisher having failed, it finally succumbed to a cocktail of
  menthol cigarettes and breath freshener that it plundered from the non-food
  section, and was pursued from the premises by Lee's cat.  The authorities
  in Kowloon deny the incident, saying that dragons are extremely rare in
  the area, that they should never be approached, that they do not exist at
  all, that the last authenticated materialisation occurred in 1932 in 
  a fireworks factory, with disastrous consequences, that the police 
  are instituting all proper precautions against these creatures which are,
  in any event, totally imaginary, and that the dragon in question was
  actually extremely small and probably harmless, so that's all right, then.

  You are at a junction of the wall here.  The symbol II is carved
  on the pavement, and the wall starts off in all four directions,
  soon disappearing into the light ground mist.  Further away, it appears
  through the mist, curving over the ridges.
