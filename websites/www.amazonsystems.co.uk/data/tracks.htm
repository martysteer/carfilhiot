This is a track opened in early 2008, the Aldershot track having been closed.
It has a more comfortable look than the Aldershot track, but the facilities
for competitors and spectators are much the same. There is
a modern results display system and a well-organised briefing area.
<P>
The current track layout was set down in 2011, and it is very different to the original track.
<P>
They use single-engined Biz indoor karts, which are quite nippy.
The track is fast, with a variable degree of grip, and is quite demanding.
It is quite wide, but the racing line is such that it limits overtaking possibilities,
and there are very few places to pass a skilled driver, even if he is a second a lap slower.
<P>
From the grid, you run up a long straight to a left-hand bend which can be taken flat out. This brings
you to a banked 180 degree bend, which can also be taken at full speed. Almost immediately, you turn right 
into a short straight with a very (very) slippery right hand hairpin, followed, before you can 
reach full speed again, by a similarly frictionless left hand hairpin. The pit entrance is on the exit to 
this bend and you may find yourself doing an involuntary pit stop. These two hairpins become easier as the 
kart tyres and track warm up, but they are never easy.
<P>
Then it's uninterrupted acceleration down a longish straight, round a long, slick left hand curve past the 
spectators,	then past the grid again.
<P>
Average lap times are 25-29 seconds. Anything in the 25-26 area is good, but the lap record is a
staggering 22!
<P>
Spectator facilities are a little sparse, the loos new and clean. 
There is a snack facility during race meetings. 50p lockers are available in the
changing room. Staff and organisation are
excellent. It's a very good track.

<P>
This is a fast outdoor track with some sharp bends, situated within the 
famous, but now disused, Brooklands banked track near Weybridge in Surrey. 
It is very grippy, and hard work to drive.
<P>
GP offer 200cc singles and twin Pro karts. (They also offer Grass Karts,
Quads and 4x4 activities - see the web site).
<P>
Crossing the Start/Finish line at speed, you soon reach a left hand
hairpin which you should not attempt to negotiate at full speed. It is
tempting to use the full width of the track on entry in order to smooth the 
180 degree bend out, but this leaves you vulnerable to an attack up the 
inside. Much better slow down and take it tight. 
<P>
On the immediate right
hand hairpin that follows, it's safe to use the whole track on exit,
then there's a pair of right hand turns that you can execute in a single
curve before a fairly easy right-angled left hander.  Then you are
turning left again, on a smoother trajectory. By this time you should be
travelling fairly quickly, and the right hand hairpin that takes you on to 
the top part of the track really hurts. 
<P>
From there, it's full throttle all
the way, taking the 90 degree right-hander onto the main straight which 
is about 150 metres long. Depending
on your speed, your nerve, and the track conditions, it's possible to take
the "bus stop" chicane, at the end of the main straight, at full throttle,
then it's into a fairly wide right-hander, followed by a tightening bend
into the start-finish straight.
<P>
It's a punishing 540 metre track, with heavy g-forces, particularly in 
the powerful pro karts. There are quite a few overtaking areas, 
especially at the hairpins.
<P>
The track facilities include a hospitality tent, excellent portable loos,
track timing and, importantly, friendly and obliging officials.
<P>
They do Juniors' sessions at the weekend.
<P>
During 2000, it was sometimes difficult to find out when Arrive and Drive
sessions would be available, but they will be putting up that kind of
information on their web site for the 2001 season.

<P>
Tel 0181 337 5550 - Outdoor
<P>
This is a fast outdoor track without sharp bends, on which 
high speeds can be achieved.  
<P>
The karts are 200cc single-engined.  They are well-maintained -
their service r&eacute;gime is methodical, though we've
occasionally had a slow kart or one inclined to lose its
chain.
<P>
The circuit is 600 metres in length, the surface is good and 
smooth. The run-off areas are mostly grass. There are some
concrete kerbs at crucial points.
<P>
It is not hard work. There are a number of sections where you can take 
a rest with your foot hard down.
<P>
From the grid, you climb a hill to a fast right-hander and head down a 
long straight which curves right relatively gently to a left/right
chicane.  The straight and this first bend are the best overtaking 
opportunities. The rest of the track has a tight racing line.
After the chicane comes a fast right hander into a short straight with a 
difficult right/left chicane downhill.  It is difficult because
of the speed you are likely to be doing when you reach it. The last
short straight (which accumulates puddles in wet weather) is another
possible overtaking point as there are two routes into the 
fast right-hander over the grid and up the hill again.
<P>
Average lap times are in the 27 second area, 25.5 is a good
lap.  Contrast this with Daytona, at a similar track length,
where average lap times are around 36 seconds. This is a fast
track.
<P>
The staff are obliging and helpful.  I've only ever practiced there,
so I don't know what the competitions are like.

<P>
Rye House has been a karting track for over twenty years.
Official RAC and UK Schools Events are held there, but
they also operate a Hire Kart operation.
<P>
The karts to use are the twin engined pro-karts (though Rye House
offer a range of karts smaller than these).
<P>
The track is tarmac, some of it rather bumpy, and in wet weather,
of course, you get puddles seeping onto the track from the grass,
all of which adds to the fun.
<P>
As you start, you are on a long straight, and you start to wonder
how fast you dare hit the right hand bend at the end.  With the right 
line, I believe you could get round the first bend at full throttle, but 
you are
immediately into a set of esses on which it is all too easy to
lose your grip.  The track then turns right onto the main straight.
In RAC events, this is the start/finish straight.  It's a long straight
which you can safely run at full throttle if you don't mind
the sensation of sitting on a pneumatic drill with someone
throwing the scenery at you.  Very exciting! There's a temptation to lift
as you reach the right-hander at the end of the straight, but
you can at least start it at full throttle, though it tightens up,
finally emerging 270 degrees later into a sharpish left-hander
followed by a left hand hairpin.  This is where you tend to find
a damp patch even long after rain, and there may be karts parked
at odd angles in your path.  Finally, there's a very hard-to-negotiate
right-hand hairpin onto the start/finish straight.
<P>
Lap times are in the 40 second area, and it's about 850 meters
long.
<P>
There are a few unusual things about the track.  The pits are
entered near the end of the right-hander after the main straight,
and you return to the track on the start/finish straight. Any
lap on which you enter the pits is not counted on the lap counter.
They have a rule that if you spin the kart or leave the track,
you must enter the pits for a driver change at the next opportunity.
<P>
The result of this is that you are strongly motivated to have long
driver sessions, and to drive carefully, as a pit stop costs
two laps at least.
<P>
Rye House have a friendly, helpful staff.  The customer displays
are PC screens. 
<P>
On their web site you will 
find views of the new building and facilities which are much
better than when I was last there. This upgrade cost more than &pound;500k 
so they should be good.
Toilets now include showers and also a disabled toilet.
<P>
They now offer the chance to hire the very lively Rotax Max karts. 
This is included in their day
time Mon-Fri hires. Groups of up to 20 people get to have a race for 40 min
on the GT1's (13hp) and then progress to 100cc and finally to the Rotax
Max.

  <P> 
  A fine track, this, with nice rental karts,
and well-organised. They do a range of karts but I've only sampled the
Pro karts - see their web page for the full range. 
<P>

This circuit report is for the 900 metre track, the only one I've driven.
From the pits, which, for rental karts, are on the start/finish straight
(owner-driver pits are at the bottom of the track - you can just see the 
entrance on the diagram) you accelerate to the long right hander at the
top end of the track. I take this as all one 180 degree curve, and
getting the inside track on someone just before this bend is an excellent
passing opportunity. You emerge onto a short straight where you
accelerate as hard as possible, though there's no hope of taking the
right-handed hairpin without slowing down. Again, you can get the drop on
someone by taking an inside line here, but watch out! At this first
hairpin, there are often karts littered around, victims of overconfidence
and bravado, so your chosen line may not be clear.  A tight line avoids
most of the casualties, I find, but it's not as quick as the best line.

<P> 

This first hairpin is followed by a second, this time to the left,
another overtaking zone cum accident blackspot, then you have a couple of
hundred yards to sort yourself out through a gentle left / right with
right foot floored. It's particularly useful to come out of the second
hairpin fast, as you may be able to overhaul someone in the long run to
the bottom of the circuit. The track goes downhill, and there are two
lines through the sweeping right-hander into the bottom. Most people take
the bend tight, lifting the throttle a little. It's also possible to
get the drop on someone by going deeper into the bend, turning late. In
either event, you brake hard into the bottom corner. The wide line at the
previous corner can give you the opportunity to brake on a tighter line
at the bottom hairpin, and get in the way of someone you are overtaking.
<P>

This is the bend round the little triangle at the bottom end of the
track.  There's a tree on the triangle, and some very hostile kerbs, and
it's accident blackspot <I>numero uno</I>.  I think the camber's
unhelpful, there's a strong tendency to lock brakes when you see someone
pirouetting in front of you and it's hard enough to get round
<i>without</i> distractions.

<P>
After this bend, move over to the right in preparation for the next left
hander. It looks easy to take on a tight line, but that sets you up wrong
for the important bend onto the start/stop straight, and if you hit the
kerb here you may lose your fillings. Then you're thumping down the
start/stop straight again past the pits.
										 
<P>

38.5 seconds for a lap of this 900 metre track is a good time in the
rental pro-karts. At that, you're <i>averaging</i> over 50mph on a half
mile track with three hairpins on it! I noticed on a recent visit that
the little owner-driver 100cc two-strokes were lapping at around 33
seconds - an average of nearly 60 - awesome!

<P>

Under floodlights, there are a couple of areas of the track - notably the
first hairpin and the long back section - which are not well illuminated,
and lots of people who drive OK in the daylight seem to overcook the
first hairpin under lights.

<P>
The brakes on the pro karts are fiercely effective, and the track is
smooth. It's easy to lock up and slide under braking, which can be a
problem till you get used to how good the brakes are.

<P>
This is an excellent circuit, and, frankly, if you enjoy karting,
it's a must. There's a shop for karting gear, instruction facilities and
all sorts. It's also a nice looking track in a nice location, with trees
all around. Canteen and toilets are very good by karting track standards,
and, let's face it, us gourmets are in the minority in the karting
fraternity.

<H2> Daytona International at Milton Keynes
</H2> 
<P> 
<a href="http://www.daytona.co.uk/">http://www.daytona.co.uk</a>
H4 Dansteed Way, Milton Keynes, MK13 8NP
(tel Freecall 0500 145 155)
<P>

This long (1350 metre) outdoor track is excellent, and a set of
twin-engined pro-karts are provided. When I was last there, there was
talk of even bigger karts to come. The karts I have found to be somewhat
variable in quality. In three trips to Milton Keynes, I have had what I
would call an "excellent" kart only once, and that in exchange for a
really bad one issued on the grid.  To be fair, I may have been
unlucky.  Three is not a big sample. The karts have a clever read-out on
the dash which tells you the lap time of your last lap, your position in
the race and how long the race has to run. All races here tend to be in
Enduro format.

<P>

The first bend at the end of the start/finish line can be taken flat out
in normal conditions, but the left/right at the end of the first
straight often tricks the unwary driver, and many off-road excursions
and embarrassing spins take place here. This kink is quickly followed by
a left-hand hairpin	and a "spoon" curve that makes a 180 degree turn to
the right again.  There are some adverse cambers here, so be alert. At
the end of this straight, the track turns right again (Point X).
This section can be taken at nearly full throttle until the sharp
left-hander that follows, then there's a rough bit that's badly
illuminated at night to another left-hand hairpin, followed by a
l-o-o-o-o-n-g straight.  At the end of this straight, there's a
left-hand curve that can be taken at or near full throttle (don't try it
on a damp evening), followed by a sharp and unfriendly right-hand
hairpin with a funny camber on the exit. You are unlikely to actually
come to grief here, but you can lose ages if you don't get it right.
Finally, there's a tight, but fast, left-hander onto the home straight
and across the start/finish again. A lap of the main track should take 1
minute 15 seconds or so.  It's possible to get below 1:10, but I've
never managed it. This is a challenging track, but lots of fun.

<P>

Sometimes, they don't use the whole International track, but go from
where I said "Point X", above, directly to near the beginning of the
main
straight, missing the right curve, the left hairpin and the rough
section.

<P>

There are a number of local rules here. The Pits area is huge, but
there's a strict speed limit enforced by making a spare driver walk
alongside any kart in the pits.  If you don't run alongside a walker,
you are penalised. If you get all four wheels off the track in some
incident, you are allowed to rescue the kart by getting out and pulling
it around, but you MUST return to the pits immediately for a safety
check.

<P>

I have only ever competed there, so I don't know what the practice
facilities are like. The staff are friendly and efficient. The marshals
are not unduly oppressive. The restaurant, changing and toilet
facilities are good.

<P>

Probably one of the top two or three outdoor rental circuits in the UK.
Don't miss it!

If you are in the South of Spain, do not miss this
delightful track.  It's heavily signposted from the
main Malaga to Cadiz road, near the centre of Fuengirola,
and it's on the road that leads to Mijas Golf. I believe
there is also a courtesy bus that commutes from some
point in the town centre.

<P>
They do practice sessions 10:00 - 20:00 (21:00 at the weekend).
The track is also used by owner-drivers. They have various
kart classes for hire, including kiddies, which use a
separate track.  Choose the fastest, as even these are
not particularly swift.
<P>
I have only used the track in a practice session, and the
map here is somewhat approximate, though true to the
feel of the circuit.
<P>
From the start/finish line, the first, right-handed hairpin
is hardish to negotiate if you've arrived at the end of the
straight at full speed, but possible with some tyre squeal.
A more measured approach does not seem to improve your
time, however. The next two bends, left and right, can be taken
quickly. At the next one, right again, prepare for a long
left-hander at the end of which is a very critical double
right-hander. The top straight terminates in another double right,
and the subsequent long, long left should be finished with a view
to negotiating a clean right-hand hairpin onto the main straight
again.
<P>
I found myself driving more and more smoothly. Except for the
first and last hairpins, the circuit can be driven at full
throttle in the rental karts. The track is wide, but the
racing line is quite critical. I found it possible,
even in inferior rental machinery, to hold off two owner-
driver karts - one a 2-stroke 100cc, the other a 320cc
pro kart - except on the two straights, where their
superior acceleration left me in the dust. I timed one of
the sessions with my own stop watch, and every lap I timed
was 59 seconds and change.
<P>
The karts are variable in quality.  In five sessions, I
had four good karts and one with awful loose steering and
no brakes. (<i>"Who needs brakes? They only slow you down."
Juan Fangio</i>)
<P>
The cafe seems OK and the toilets are good.  The cafe has
a high viewing platform from which you can see the whole
circuit. 
<P>
Richly recommended, especially for the circuit layout.

F1 Raceway is a short, fairly slow track. 
As the map shows, it's hairpin city... in this case, good for overtaking:
lots of possible lines between the two hairpins, and no optimum line.
start/finish line is one of the fastest parts of the track, carrying speed
out of the nearly flat out last two corners. Hard brake and a slide around
the 1st hairpin, then gently round the 2nd hairpin, late apexing for
acceleration. These two hairpins are close together enough to prevent full
use of the track width in-between, hence no obvious racing line. Flat out
round the 90 degree left hander, then up a small ramp to the right hairpin.
Accurate braking and line up to then a wide line around this corner wins you
the fastest lap times. Flat out round the 90 degree right hander. The back
straight is very slippery - you need to turn in early, lifting off slightly,
then get back onto the power as you clip the 1st apex for a 4 wheel drift to
the start/finish line. Frustratingly,
the lap record quoted seems to change daily - it might be 17.43 or 17.83. 
18.5 is very quick, 19.5 respectable.
<P>
Electronic timing. Lap by lap printouts
available. 180cc Karts generally in good order, though braking
characteristics vary wildly. Electronic engine controllers used to stop/slow
karts during stoppages. If you spin here and they stop the race to get you
going you get a lap deducted! Helmets clean, but scratched visors (don't
need them down anyway, here). No gloves. Suits are lightweight Kwik-Fit
overall type, for over the top of jeans etc. Well organised.

In the popular resort of Hersonissos (various spellings) and quite near equally popular Malia,
this is essentially a holiday karting venue. Nevertheless, the track is excellent, the karts
in good order and there's an elevated viewing platform with cafe.<P>

Quite a lot of the track can be driven at full throttle, particularly between C and F.<P>

F is a tricky hairpin, particularly with cold tyres. From F to C it's hard work.<P>

There are useful kerbs at all the main bends, and room to overtake in lots of places. Really
an entertaining track, particularly if you are sent out with a few newbie holiday-makers as
mobile chicanes.

Located centrally on the Island of Malta, this karting track is easily accessible 
and if you are ever on a visit there, do not miss this challenging track. They open 
from Tuesday to Sunday, from 17.00hrs till 23.00 on weekdays and from 12.00 till 23.00 
on weekends. Owner-drivers also use the track. 
<P>They have two different fleet of Karts for hire, one being the commercial fleet 
equipped with a 4 stroke 270cc Honda engine mounted on a heavy-duty chassis 
capable of reaching speeds of up to 55kph. The Pro fleet are also equipped with 
the same 270cc Honda engine but have a high performance centrifugal clutch which 
is mounted on a lightweight pro chassis capable of reaching 70kph and are normally 
reserved for the more experienced drivers and are only available for race events 
and not for practice sessions.
<P>The track is well maintained and has a variety of 17 different track layouts, including
both directions. The layout is changed every fortnight, but for this review we shall go 
through just one of them.
<P>Exiting the pits you are faced with a long straight which finishes off with a fast 
left bend, then comes a tricky S part with a tight left and hard right. If you overshoot 
the straight it is easy to end up on the grass area. Once this is manoeuvered, a short 
straight leads you to a right turn and up towards a left hairpin and onto a right-handed 
fast downhill and onto a sharp right U-turn which is also hard to negotiate if you come 
in too fast. Next up is a wider right-hander but surprisingly the part where most 
newcomers find themselves off the track. This leads to a wide long right bend, which 
leads to a narrow right bend and onto the start finish.
<P>The karts are generally well maintained and compare well with each other; the 
staff are quite friendly and will quickly change a kart that you are unhappy with. 
The club house has a fully stocked bar and restaurant, big screen TV showing live 
events on satellite, billiards, games room and an internet cafe. On the roof terrace 
an excellent view of the track may be enjoyed.
<P>Throughout the summer weekly tourist races are organized, pitting total 
strangers from different countries against each other. These may be booked at 
hotels or at the various booking offices available all over the Island.

<h3>Karts:</h3>
The adult karts are 390cc 4-stroke honda powered Biz Thunderkarts and they
have ROC dashboard displays with lap time readouts and lap counters. 390cc
is quite big for a single-cylinder engine, and this results in a pretty
grunty (torquey) kart engine. Power is 13bhp, and top speed at thruxton is
about 60mph (which is actually achievable). The brakes on the karts are very
good - not quite real race style, but miles better than anything I've tried
indoors, or at daytona. Most of the karts share the same feel, though one I
tried (out of 6) had very heavy steering. I put that one down as an anomaly,
as overall the different karts are very consistent. The timing system
produces a useful printed output with a graph of laptimes, trend line and so
on - you won't be looking at the dash much while you're driving due to
vibrations and having to steer, so having this afterwards is good if you're
working on your technique.
<P>
<h3>Circuit:</h3>
Thruxton is an outdoor circuit and to my knowledge, as of today (May 2006)
it's the only outdoor track with a crossover in the UK.
Although Thruxton advertise the circuit as 1100m long, the circuit is most
commonly configured missing out a loop between the hairpin after you go
under the crossover and the chichane leading to the back straight. It's
easier to marshal this way, and they never use it at night because that's a
part of the circuit without any floodlights. I've never had the chance to
try it! In the shorter "club" configuration, which is just under 900m long,
the circuit is still challenging. The track starts with a short run uphill
out of the pits, straight onto the racing line for people already on track
(for this reason, there are marshal controlled red/green pit exit lights).
Anyone ignoring a red light here will be hit up the back by a kart
travelling at a closing speed of what I'd estimate is about 40mph, and that
would be no small accident. Be aware!
<P>
<h3>Track notes:</h3>
Once on the main track, the first corner is a lefthander which is tricky to
judge as it's slightly offcamber (slightly downhill) on the exit, and there
is a lot of green plastic rumble strip on the exit. It's really worn down -
lots of people come in here too fast and end up with 4 wheels off the track.
If you get it right round here on a hot lap, it's *nearly* but not quite
flat out. Letting the back of the kart drift a little at the exit requires
good control and judgement of speed on the way in. You should let the kart
get quite sideways for what follows. If it's done correctly, the kart will
be pointing direcly at the next (gentle) left with no extra corrections on
the steering. There are a couple of different lines through the right-left
hairpin that follows. I consider this the most tricky corner on the circuit.
The entry can either be on a flat surface or if the marshals aren't looking,
across the kerb. The kerbs unsettle the karts a lot, but do gain you quite a
lot of time here (perhaps a couple or three tenths). The braking is as heavy
as possible, and if at all possible you should ensure the kart is
more-a-less straight for it (trail-braking doesn't gain much here). On the
entry try to make the track as short (tight) as possible - lots of people
waste time running the kart round on the outside and it loses them time. The
exit of the hairpin seems to take ages to appear - it's important to get the
power down as early as possible, but not to run wide. With that over, we
head towards another chicane before going under the crossover. This chichane
is a left-right. For this one it's best to compromise the initial left in
order that the horrible, heavily off-camber right that follows is easier for
the kart to go through flat out. It's important not to run too far out to
the outside on the exit of the righthander as the tarmac surface is higher
than the few inches of grass, and if you drop a left wheel down off the
track here you're taking a trip straight to the scene of the accident. Under
the bridge, I tend to run out over to the left of the track, then cut back
across to the right on the heavily positive camber available. As I come out
the other side, this gives a wide entry to the left-hander hairpin at the
bottom of a small hill. The karts will want to oversteer here, and it will
slow them down in the most important accelleration zone on the circuit. It's
flat out from here for a long time, and if you get it wrong people will blas
past you on the long straight that follows. There's a really easy
srtaight-line through the chichane before the sweeping back straight, it's
absolutely flat in the dry. The straight is actually a gentle left-handed
curve. Running down the inside seems intuitively to be the shorter path but
there's really not that much in it, having tried running two karts down the
straight side by side with a friend a few times (we used different karts and
there really isn't that much of a difference). As you approach the
left-right-left high speed complex at the end if it, you should run your
kart out to the outside of the track, to straightline the entry to the first
part of the complex as much as possible. Try to ignore what would happen if
you spin off - it's quick here! It's actually quite feasible to go through
here flat out in the dry, but you may find a small lift on the entry helps
get the kart better prepared for the right-left. On the exit of the
lefthander, hug the inside f the track like it's your favourite granny
(again, flat out). Ignore the yellow-lined pit entry, but be careful not to
drift wide and into someone!. Go through the chichane flat out too. Just
straightline it - there's no problems with that in the dry. The lefthander
leading onto the pit straight can also be taken flat, though depending on
the kart's handling characteristics it might be quicker to lift on the entry
if the kart is understeering or oversteering badly. Flat out straight up to
the first corner again, and start another lap!
