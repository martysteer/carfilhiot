The main objectives of this site are to introduce newcomers to
the joys of karting, to broadcast information about the
good kart rental tracks and organisers, and to match individuals and 
teams to events.
<P>
If you wish to contribute, mail me.  I'll accept news, circuit reviews, 
additional driving hints, adverts for open meetings, money, abuse, all
that sort of thing.
<P>
Mail me at

include your contribution as soon as I can, or tell you why not!
<P>
The kind of karting we'll be discussing here is the accessible end of the
karting scene.  We're talking about rental karts at indoor and outdoor
circuits, where you can cut your teeth in someone else's hardware
while you find out if you'll ever measure up to the drivers
who eventually graduate to Grand Prix.  It is the cheapest way to learn 
how to race, and although the karts are generally not tuned to within
an inch of the engine's life, the engine capacities are generous and
the handling characteristics of all karts have a common theme with
all single-seat racing cars - ie if you overcook it or brake at
the wrong moment, you spin.
<P>
There is an understandable tendency to classify this kind of karting
as a fairground ride rather than serious racing, and, certainly,
there are some truly terrible circuits and organisers.  Conversely,
there are many organisations who seriously intend to field races and
race practice, rather than dodgems.
<P>
It costs thousands of pounds per year to compete in RAC events with a
kart of your own.  If you are very good, that's where you will
probably end up, but in the meantime, with rental karts, you can have a 
practice once a week and an race event, say, every six weeks, and it
needn't cost more than eight hundred pounds a year. 
<P>
In this section, I refer to kart drivers as "he" and "him", but it's
worth noting that many of the fastest karters are girls.  There's no
quarter expected or given, either.

</H2>
<P>
We are talking here not about the circuit itself, but about the
organiser and the facilities he provides at the track.
<P>
At a good track, the karts will be in a good state of repair, and will
be well-matched so that, as far as possible, no-one suffers an unfair
disadvantage from a slow or badly set up kart.
<P>
Some organisers have the illusion that they can cobble up a kart
chassis from box girders that will be just as good as a 'real' one.
Most of these are truly awful.  Part of the kart's handling 
involves the chassis flexing in a helpful fashion, changing the geometry
of the chassis to actually assist cornering.  In particular, the inside
front wheel of a kart tends to lift in a tight bend. Professional
kart manufacturers have brought this design to a fine art.  An amateur
design can give a totally misleading impression of how a kart should
drive, and most of them are exhausting to control, as they are fighting
the driver all the way round the track.
<P>
Many organisers now have two fleets of karts - one for competition and
one for practice - and the practice karts are bent and much-repaired.
Having said that, many practice karts look terrible, but handle well,
as they are, after all, last year's competition karts.  A mechanic with
some kart maintenance skill can bend a twisted chassis back into shape, the
wheel alignment is critical, but fairly simple to set up, and the engines -
usually 4-stroke Honda or Yamaha industrial grade motors - are robust, and
are not exactly on a knife-edge tuning regime, so don't go off-tune very
readily.  An old kart with squashed, skid-marked side-pods and battered
nerf bars which has been well-maintained mechanically will go faster than a 
spanking-new model that hasn't been properly set up.
<P>
In a way, it's nice that the practice machinery is NOT 100% identical, as 
a novice 
occasionally gets the chance to thrash a good driver who has drawn a
bad kart, and the "expert" gets a bit of practice in defensive driving!
<P>
It's important, if you practice and compete regularly, to get your lap times
during practice.  Some organisers seem to feel that it's not 
important to them, so it's not important to you.  But it is important
as an incentive to go faster and drive better,  
so always press the organisers to
give you computerised timing for your practice.  They can nearly all do it,
it's just a question of willingness.  Our team has stopped going to
Sandown because they won't do our practice times.

<a name="karttypes">Types of Kart</a>
</H2>
<P>
There are two basic types of kart for rental use, if we eliminate
the children's variety and the occasional organiser, like Playscape, 
who also supply a high performance kart under controlled circumstances.
<P>

The first, and most common, type is a single-engined 160cc 4-stroke
kart with a maximum speed of around 40mph.  This may not seem much, 
but on a short, tight circuit 40mph is flying.
<P>

The second type, a twin-engined 2*160cc 4-stroke kart, often known as
Pro-Kart, is usually only seen outdoors, and has a top speed of
around 70mph (this is a rental kart - competitive Pro-Karts may be
faster).
<P>

Other than in the power department, the two kart types are fairly
similar.  The weight of the extra engine is more than cancelled
by the additional power, and heavyweights like myself are more
competitive in a Pro-Kart.
<P>

These karts both have a centrifugal clutch, so you don't have to worry
about starting.  They only have one gear, so even your mother could drive one.
It's right foot Go, left foot Stop, and steering wheel.
<P>

The steering only has half a turn from lock to lock.  This makes
it hard work to turn, more so at slower speeds.  A little turn has a
lot of effect on a kart.
<P>

A kart is a few inches wider at the back wheels than it is at the front.
Novices have a tendency to bump into the scenery with their back
tyres, even if they cleared it by an inch or two with the front.

<P>
<H2>
<a name="drivchar">Driving Characteristics</a>
</H2>
<P>
Whether there are one or two engines, the back axle is driven by  
chain from the engine(s).  It is a solid axle.  There is no differential,
and here lies the root of a kart's handling characteristics.  The tendency
of the kart is to run in a straight line, because both back wheels are
rotating at the same speed.  This means that it understeers at first,
and this effect is particularly noticeable in Pro-Karts, because
most of the weight is at the back.  However, once the adhesion of the 
back wheels is broken, and it starts to turn the way you are steering,
it flips into oversteer.  These characteristics are also those of
Grand Prix cars, and those drivers who, like Senna and Schumaker, come up
through karting seem to find the transition natural.  I recently drove
a NASCAR Legends car, and it feels much the same, as do Spedeworth
Superstox which I raced for a couple of years.
<P>

I'll discuss some of the finer points of driving on the
Driving Hints page.
