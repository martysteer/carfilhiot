Typical Event Formats
</H2>
</a><P>
<H3>
Individual Sprint (sometimes called Grand Prix)
</H3>
<H4>
<P>
Each driver gets four or five heats, starting in a different
grid position each time.  The heats have up to six karts in them
and are mixed up by an electric computer,
or by a chap with a piece of paper and a crayon, so that groups
of friends who checked in together don't necessarily race together. 
Everyone who finishes a given heat is awarded points, sometimes
even the non-finishers, but the nearer the front you finish, the more
points you get.  At the end of the heats, the points are added up and
used to award grid positions in the semi-finals.  Sometimes,
everyone gets a semi-final, but usually it's about 60% of the entries.
The first two (or three) in each semi get a place on the grid of the
final.  As always, points and places can be deducted for
unfair tactics like ramming, switching off competitors' engines
and ignoring marshals' flag signals.
</H4>
<H3>
Team Enduro (sometimes called Le Mans)
</H3>
<H4>
<P>
In theory, enduro teams are a specific size, usually four to six, but
experience has shown that it is hard to get everyone to turn
up, and the rule is often bent to specify a minimum number
of driver changes, so that teams are frequently as small as two.
<P>
In an enduro, each team drives as a relay, changing drivers when
they see fit, until the time is up, and the team with the most
laps wins.  Enduro lengths are anything
from two to twenty-four hours.  
<P>
From a practical point of view,
most people lose their edge after half an hour and some are 
exhausted after fifteen minutes.  I have done a one-hour, one-driver 
enduro, and though I could still drive at the end of the hour, I 
found some difficulty in walking afterwards!
<P>
Driver changes, however, are time-consuming, and you have to balance
driver efficiency against time wasted in changing.
<P>
Initial grid positions may be determined by lot, or by choosing
an arbitrary moment at which to start the race with all the teams 
rolling, or by lap times achieved in a practice session. Aldershot
even uses a Le Mans start with drivers running to their karts.

</H4>
<H3>
Team Sprint
</H3>
<H4>
<P>
This format is less common than the other two.  As in individual
sprint, each driver gets four or five heats, starting in a different
grid position each time.  The heats have up to six karts in them.
During the heats, only one driver from any given team will
appear in any given heat.   
<UL>
<P>
The second half of the meeting
usually takes one of the following forms:
<P>
<LI>In one form, the second
half is a mini enduro using the current points standings
to determine initial grid position.  
<LI>In another, the team
is invited to choose which team member will participate in each
final (there is a different final for each team member,
but the grid positions for the team are different in each case).
The points for the finals are added to those of the heats
for each team.
<br>
Sometimes, in this format, double points are awarded for places gained,
and single points deducted for places lost,
rather than points being awarded for finishing position, so that 
starting a good driver from your team at the back of the grid
becomes a good idea, and adds to the fun.
