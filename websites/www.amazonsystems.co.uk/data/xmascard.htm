Christmas and New Year Greetings

This Christmas card celebrates our new digital camera, as well as
the snow which fell six days early and vanished before Christmas
day.  
<p>
Here you see our photogenic boxer dog, rather mystified by the snow,
but still prepared to play, given some provocation.  The camera 
provided such provocation, and she managed to evade its lens, blur
herself by rapid movement, and for the most part, to show only
 her hind-quarters. This sport
lasted an hour or so and filled three floppy discs with worthless jpegs.
Still, we have spared you the photographs of ourselves.

I am determined that this page shall not degenerate into a boastful,
self-serving journal, such as we receive in increasing quantities
each Yuletide.
<P> 
When we got our first little home computer - an Atari&nbsp;800 in 1979 -
we proudly printed out our Christmas card list on sticky labels,
and saved ourselves the trouble of writing the addresses on 
envelopes. At no point since have we gone
beyond this simple mechanisation, I promise you!
<P>
However, a creeping tide of annual journals began to assail us as computer
ownership spread to proud parents and grandparents - you know the style:
<p>
<i>Frederick has just been promoted to Lance Corporal in the Royal
Horseminders Regiment. He turned down Mr Yeltsin's offer to lead
the Russian Army in 2000, because he has a number of important
golf matches to play.
<p>
Katherine has completed a course in finger-painting at the London
School for the Otherwise Incapable, and hopes to land a job re-creating
the Sistine Chapel in His Holiness the Pope's country cottage.
<p>
Arthur and I spent an interesting activity holiday in the troglodyte
caves of Burkina Faso {... excerpt from travel book faithfully copied
out here...}</i>
<P>
This was capped by the first of this year's crop to arrive - a fully
illustrated double-sided newsletter. 
<P>
The trauma of its appearance drove us into a frenzy of retro.
So we printed out the Christmas
card list on plain paper, and Beryl faithfully transcribed it onto 
individual envelopes... in pen and ink.
<p>
The rest of you get this web page, and our best wishes.

Did I mention that, after the snow went, it became rather damp
underfoot?

So, rather than just saying "Bah! Humbug!", we proffer festive
greetings.  If you want to know what our children (and grandchildren)
are up to, or where we went for our holidays, I'm sure you'll write 
and ask. And we will write back to you personally. In all probability.
