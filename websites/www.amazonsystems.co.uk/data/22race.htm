The winners - Tim Foster's Foster's 3-pack - did a remarkable job,
though we all rather frowned at the suede racing boots. He might at
least have worn dirty trainers like the rest of us. This affectation led
us to believe that these chaps had done this kind of thing before. <P>
The Fugitives - Gil, Joe Czirbesz and Nathan Vosloo - came in second.
Because he'd done so badly in the Le Mans start, Gil had to fight his
way up from eighth off the start line to first, which took over half an
hour, and relied on passing Fosters in the Pits. In order to build an
unfair advantage, Gil drove 1hr 15min to the first fuel change. There
was a move to call the team The Fugitive. Joe took over for about 45
minutes, but was unhappy with his form, though the record shows he
retained our position throughout his spell.  Nathan took over and drove
some very fast laps, but got involved in a tussle or two with back
markers, and was never closer than a lap behind Foster's 3-Pack. <P>
Nathan's hamburger and bacon butty had just been delivered when Joe
handed over to Nathan. Our cunning plan to nobble Team Torque by causing
them to eat it seems to have worked, because The Sore Helmets, who had
been pressing Team Torque throughout, squeezed through at the end to
finish  third.  A great performance from David Shafto's rather rusty
team. <P> Team Torque.  What can I say? Nothing.  Here's what John Farr
himself says:<p> <blockquote><i> Off To A Flyer...... <P> <P>Well, what a start for Team Torque. The `Le Mans` style start proved to
be interesting. I mean, the last time I ran that hard, I was trying to
get away from some mad chinese chef armed with a meat-cleaver after I
complained about the state of his noodles. As I approached the kart, I
managed a Double-Axle, followed by a half-twist and a perfect landing
into the kart - all of which would have done Torville & Dean proud....I
swear I heard the kart groan ! <P> I was passed by one kart, so I set
off in pursuit. After 10 minutes or so, I  caught and passed him and
attempted to build up a healthy lead. Unfortunately, our kart had other
ideas (well it was early on a Sunday morning, so it can be forgiven). As
the engine got  up to working temperature, it became slightly less
efficient, as proved by the world and his kart consistently out-dragging
us for the rest of the meeting. Only having a strong line-up prevented
us from slipping down the tables further. <P> When The Chips Are Down,
Along Comes A Free T-Bone.... We were j-u-s-t hanging on to third place
when cramp forced Gary to pit after only 28 minutes` of his driving
time.  The rest of the team had taken their drives and were out of their
overalls. (Indeed, Mark was out of the building and was on his way for a
game of golf !), it was left to the Pup to hastily don a helmet and
drive the last 15 minutes of the meeting (without overalls) to try and
make up the deficit, but unfortunately for us, to no avail.
</i></blockquote> <P> Fork in Fast made a late run.  At the end, they
proved stronger than the teams around them, and lost less ground on the
leaders than most. <p> The Skidmarks, with Nigel Longton, a sometime
Fugitive and Blue, finished next.  They distinguished themselves by
posting the fastest lap of the day, and by permitting Foster's to run
over their captain's foot in the pits. <P> What can I say about Fork in
Crap, other than to speak their name out loud. Oh.  I could also say
they made a promising start. Reading the stats, something must have
happened at the halfway stage that took the sting out of their attack,
though they hung on to beat Norfolk & Chance over the line. <P> Whatever
happened to Fleet Elite?  These guys had actually been practicing on the
circuit in previous weeks.  They had talent in depth. You couldn't fault
their aggression. Musta been a duff kart, I suppose... <p> Norfolk &
Chance?  Precisely.  A for effort, though, and they were consistent.
Totally consistent. <P> Big Swingers.  Well, in a lesser field, any one
of the teams could have won. Yes.  Even the Swingers. Probably. <P> All
in all, though, a good humoured event with very competent driving. No
black flags, as far as I remember, and very few red flags for track
blockages.
