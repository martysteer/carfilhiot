<font color="#00008B"><H2>Brief History of Amazon's Games &amp; Toys</H2></font>
</center>

<H4>In the mid 1980s, Amazon Systems developed many cartridge games 
for Sinclair Spectrum, Philips G7000 and C64, typically in 8K and 16K
ROMs!  A technical challenge in most cases!
<P>
  We also developed cassette equivalents of the Spectrum and C64 games
and wrote new games for BBC, Acorn Electron, Atari 800, C64 and VIC.
<P>
Among the games we originated were:
<UL> 
<LI>The Paul Daniels Magic Adventure; 
<LI>Locomotion; 
<LI>Hotfoot.
</UL>
<P>
Among the games we converted from Arcade machines were:
<UL> 
<LI>Star Wars; 
<LI>Gyruss;
<LI>Q*Bert;
<LI>Popeye;
<LI>Death Star Battle;
<LI>Tutankhamen;
<LI>Panama Joe (Montezuma's Revenge).
</UL>
<P>
We also reverse-engineered the Philips G7000 system, and built a development
route, and we designed a cartridge interface for the Spectrum, as well as  
several cartridge PCBs.
<P>
It was also at about this time that we developed the talking rabbit which
was exhibited at Toy Fairs to much acclaim.  It used an embedded program
and could speak several hundred phrases using a voice chip.
<P>

From early 1981 to 1985, we also did a lot of NTSC to PAL conversion 
(and vice-versa) 
of games for other games companies.
