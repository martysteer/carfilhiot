<center><H2>Mornington Crescent - The History </H2></center>
<P>
<H4>
The game of Mornington Crescent was invented in the late
nineteenth century by the drivers of Hackney carriages as
a serious attempt to design a one-way system around the 
increasingly busy area of Euston in London.  It is
variously credited to Arthur Mowe, a Cockney, and
Horstmann Ure, a second generation Silesian immigrant.
<P>
A simple, but profitable, variation 
on the game is still played by London
taxi drivers, because their motto is "He was a stranger, and I took
him in".  Cabbies try to include Mornington
Crescent in every journey.  This helps to maximise
fares for journeys which would not naturally contain
a diversion via the Euston district.  
<P>
An Edinburgh,
Scotland, taxi driver holds the current unofficial 
record.  Fraser McFurtive (37) managed to include Mornington
Crescent in a journey between Drumsheugh Gardens and
Milton Road West (both in Edinburgh), on the excuse that 
he was avoiding congestion in Princes Street (without
mentioning that there is also a Princes Street in London).
<P>
Sven (48, 26, 27), a muscular Swedish taxi driver, is currently a contender
for the distance title.  He is
en route between Kongsgatan and Tegelbacken (both in Stockholm),
but, like most of us, has so far failed to reach Mornington Crescent,
though he has been in London for several years now.
It has been contended that, since his passenger 
returned to Stockholm by air in 1993, his attempt
ought to be declared null and void.  But not yet...
hey, give the guy a chance!  Declare it null and void when
he's finished.
<P>
A totally different game of the same name is played on BBC Radio..
regrettably, mostly for laughs.  To their credit,
however, the radio-based exponents of the game
are very fast on their feet, since they do not have
to travel anywhere. They have contributed some of
the more recent rule changes, including "Begging and
Pleading" (an end-game decoration) and "Gruntfuttock's Posture"
(in which the moves of the game are retrospectively altered
in order to favour one player or another - also known as
"editing the broadcast tape").
<P>
Today, the real game is played by grizzled aficionados
(though it is not <i>necessary</i> to be foreign) without the
aid of the London A-Z or the map of the London Underground.  In
fact, even the Penguin-keepers' Yearbook is outlawed from
the professional game, which attracts hushed groups of
onlookers on street corners from Ouagadougou to Ulan Bator,
and even Basingstoke.

There cannot be anyone in the civilised world who does not
already know the basic rules of Mornington Crescent,
so we shall not insult our readers by re-iterating them
here.  Suffice to say, if you have temporarily forgotten
them, or if you come from, say, the uncivilised world, such as,
for example, France, you will certainly pick them up as
you go along.  Beginners will discover that Mornington
Crescent is a little like golf, a little like shove-ha'penny,
quite a lot like watching your laundry in the tumble-drier,
and most closely resembles feeling around in the dark for
a pocketful of loose change dropped in an unlit, damp alleyway on
a Saturday night after a few beers.  That is to say:
frustrating, hard on the right forefinger, disorienting,
even more disorienting, sheer hell on the right forefinger,
and frustrating... probably in that order.
<P>
The game as presented here is, of course, a cut-down version.
Nevertheless, it has all the characteristics of the real
game, and the computer plays only slightly less well than a 
human player, giving the novice a fighting chance.
<P>
It is based on a portion of the London Underground system,
as it was prior to 1971.
<P>
This computer version has 36 place names, as opposed to the 
26,000 or so in the full game, and it may be thought a little
niggardly.  We do not consider this to be
a bad thing, because it encourages subtlety, as you will see.
<P>
Watch out for a change of rules between games, and even
during games.  This is one of the best features of the
game, as you probably know.
<P>
Oh... and please remember that your score will be sent to
your employer as part of your next staff assessment; may
be quoted in court in the event of a character reference 
being required; and a good score, accredited by Samantha, 
will shortly be necessary in the states of
California and Utah when applying for a licence to
impersonate Marcel Marceau in a public place, so, please, NO CHEATING!  You have
been warned.  Since your computer can legally impersonate Marcel
Marceau without a permit, you may find it cheats quite
readily.  However, computers are rather unsophisticated in
deception, and you will quickly recognise its little ploys.
We favour a sharp kick to the Turbo button as a discipline,
but others prefer just to withdraw power until it promises to behave.
<P>
Now Play !
