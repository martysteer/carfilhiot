	   <P>
	    Our first
contest at this excellent new track, a scant  fortnight after its
opening.   <P> We were fielding Team Torque with all Norwegian Blues
drivers - the usual suspects were in four of the positions, and it was
David Shafto's  first competitive outing. - <ul> <li>Gary Denny (captain
this time) <li>John Farr  <li>Joe Czirbesz <li>David Shafto  <li>Gil
</ul>   <P> The event was an enduro, five drivers per kart, and we were
to drive 30 minutes each. There was to be a 2-lap bonus for the fastest
lap. <P> The ingeniously designed Le Mans start had placed our kart
right at the back of the field, but three of the drivers fell during the
sprint to the waiting karts,  and Gil managed to get off in about sixth
place.  Regrettably, the favourites, "What Flag?", who had been fastest
in practice, shot into a half-lap  lead, as their start position (chosen
randomly) had been  very favourable. <P> With cold tyres and thirteen
karts on the track, there were multiple pile-ups early on, and Gil's
street-fighting skills were in frequent use.  Such was the confusion
that he only picked up one warning for aggressive behaviour! After Gil's
half-hour, we were in second place, not far behind the leaders, who,
however, had set up the fastest lap so far, and were thus effectively 2
laps up due to the bonus. <P> Gary quickly retrieved the time lost in
driver change, and his session, Joe's and David's successful first
outing were characterised by excellent safe fast drives, always on the
same lap as the "What Flag?",  often nearly lapping them, but never
quite achieving that crucial fastest lap. <P> Disaster struck at the
last driver change, where John was to take over from David. David
arrived in the pits,  and John hadn't appeared there yet. David left the
kart  there to go looking for John, and the kart set off on  its own.
When they came back it had driven itself off  into a corner of the pits
and they had to manhandle it  back. In short, a slow change, and we'd
lost more than  a lap. <P> However, fate came to our aid. "What Flag?"
committed a black flag offence, and were given a 30 second penalty,
which they managed to extend to 80 by arguing about it. Between this and
a brilliant drive by John, we moved into a 2 lap lead which was cemented
in place by John hitting the fastest lap time again and again.  But John
wasn't finished yet. As he rounded the final bend to approach the
chequered flag, he crashed into the barrier, 3 yards from the finish.
The man with the flag had to drop it to pull him out of trouble, and
John puttered ignominiously across the finish line - happily still in
the lead. <P> A heart-stopping victory, with John cast as both villain
and hero.  There was never a dull moment.
