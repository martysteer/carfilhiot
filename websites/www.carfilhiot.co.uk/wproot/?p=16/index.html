				<p>&#8230;you are a fan of Jack Vance, you may be wondering about the name I&#8217;ve adopted here. In Vance&#8217;s Lyonesse trilogy, there appears a character called Carfilhiot, cruel and arrogant, and really one of the villains of the piece with whom I do not really wish to associate myself. Nevertheless, his name, and that of his &#8216;twin&#8217; sister, Melancthe, have stuck in my mind for many a long year as really excellent names to use when the occasion arose.</p>
<p>Books are a bit of a problem here. I&#8217;ve always been surrounded by hundreds of my books, and buy dozens every year. Here, I&#8217;m stuck with the few I brought with me, and some appalling popular fiction stocked for tourists. I&#8217;ve been reduced to downloading classics from The Gutenberg Project, and have renewed my acquaintance with Sir Walter Scott, John Buchan and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I&#8217;ve also been bathing in nineteenth century poetry &#8211; so much more satisfactory than most of the tripe that&#8217;s written these days. One of the books I did bring with me was an old Penguin Odyssey, but I haven&#8217;t had the urge to read it yet.</p>
<p>Spent the afternoon scraping paint off the boat. Apparently it has to go back to the bare wood for preservation. You&#8217;d be amazed how many coats the previous owners slapped on over the years. In places it&#8217;s a quarter inch thick!</p>
