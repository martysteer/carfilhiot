			<h2>This Morning..</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>&#8230; I came to the door of my shack and looked out over the few square yards of my tumbledown-walled estate. My old olive tree leaned towards the sea far below, though the cool air was perfectly still. The sea, stretched out like a vast carpet to the high horizon, was only slightly rippled. From here, no other building is in sight. I might be totally alone. I told myself I had made the right decision in coming to this Greek island, and, for once, I agreed.</p>
<p>There was also the additional frisson as I anticipated starting this journal. I spent most of yesterday setting it all up the way I wanted, doing a few tests, then cleared all the test entries. A clean slate, like a new empty jotter and a sharp pencil, one of my childhood delights.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s now so late, and I have been sharpening my keyboard and licking my lips for more than half an hour before setting finger to key, so there&#8217;s no time for more today. I&#8217;m eating out tonight.</p>
