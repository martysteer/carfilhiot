					<p>&#8230; in sunny Corfu, a couple of days early for my meeting with Albanian officials. Sophia and I are companionably surfing side-by-side in the cyber caf&eacute; behind the church of St Spiridon.</p>
<p>We were robbed on our way here. Stopping at a roadside snackbar called Tweety, we ordered club sandwiches. The waiter urged us to try a few Greek hors d&#8217;oeuvres while we waited. The snacks were very nice. The club sandwiches were all but inedible. The bill was 66 Euros! Living, as we do, in a place where food and wine are good value, I&#8217;d forgotten just how rapacious tourist traps can be. This must not be taken as a general rule in Corfu, however, as I have eaten at a similar caf&eacute; in the past which was excellent in every way.</p>

					<p>&#8230; which reached a peak a few weeks ago, has subsided to a murmur since I made that last entry. For a start, being in each other&#8217;s pockets, as it were, ( * see Footnote) doesn&#8217;t seem to bother Sophia and me, and we suddenly realised an important fact. Around the current shack, there is quite an area of rough grass, stones and chunks of concrete left behind from the building of the current edifice, an area which, other than the olive tree, is of little, even negative, value.</p>
<p>We are now in conversation with a local architect to have an extension built &#8211; an extension more beautiful than the original building, yet in keeping with the rural aspect.</p>
<p>Of course, it is immensely complicated, as you would expect, more complicated than buying new, but the advantages of developing my original house, as Petros (the architect) points out, are the relative ease of getting planning permission, the excellent views from our current location, our proximity to the road, the simplicity of connecting to water, electricity and drains. To double our floor area with a swishy new building containing a REAL bathroom and a large living area, it&#8217;s going to cost less than a second-hand BMW. We&#8217;re in no hurry. Which is probably just as well, because even minor building projects seem to last for years around here &#8211; centuries, in some cases, just ask Pisistratus.</p>

					<p>&#8230; moment here. We had one of these days when storm clouds loom across the Med, while the sea was preternaturally calm, though steely grey. The sun was represented by a series of white scars between the cumulus. Sophia called me out onto the terrace (slab of chipped concrete) and you could see grey streamers trailing down from this dark cloud. Suddenly one of the streamers touched the sea, stirring it up into a froth, and raising a waterspout!</p>
<p><img src="http://carfilhiot.co.uk/images/20060620-waterspout.jpg" alt="waterspout" /><br />
OK &#8211; I admit it. This photo isn&#8217;t mine. Who has the presence of mind to grab a camera when something like this happens? It appeared in the local paper, and closely resembles what we saw.</p>
<p>I understand from Alexis that waterspouts are by no means unusual, and, occasionally, a fishing boat gets trashed by one. They always, he says, expire before they hit the shore (the waterspout, that is, not the boat).</p>

					<p>&#8230; returned today. I was irritated, because I suspected they wanted to talk to me without Spiros (my Corfiote lawyer). However, they were so perfunctory that I became almost sure they only had this interview to justify staying in the sunny islands for the weekend.</p>
<p>My faith was restored when the Pope later told us that they have been ransacking Ginger&#8217;s house instead of lounging on the beach.. </p>

					<p>&#8230; not to give the British detectives any room to accuse me or Alfredo of wrong-doing, whilst attempting to help them out as far as I could. My lawyer has advised me to keep these events private, so the conversations will not appear here &#8211; not for a while, anyway. There was no question, it appears, of my being in trouble, as the victim of a &#8220;hacking&#8221; incident. Alfredo&#8217;s subsequent investigation was marginally borderline, and that&#8217;s been erased, anyway.</p>
<p>    [EDIT] As at the current date (29 March 06), Alfredo&#8217;s website is still down, and Dork is now off the air, too, so I suppose they have swooped in the US. I hope this is the last we&#8217;ll hear of it. I suggested to Alfredo that when he re-publishes fauxhunter that he removes the explicit details he was previously displaying.</p>

					<p>&#8230; that throughout his conversations with the police, Alfredo managed not to mention my real name or location even once, which I regard as exceptionally loyal behaviour. They had his blog, and, therefore, my blog &#8211; and presumably they believed what they read, but he just kept telling them it was none of their business.</p>
<p>However&#8230; I got an email this morning (they had his PC, after all), requesting my &#8220;co-operation on an on-going investigation&#8221;. I replied, making it clear that they would have to come here. They readily agreed, and they&#8217;ll be here on Friday. I hastily arranged for an English-speaking lawyer from Corfu &#8211; Spiros &#8211; to be here, too.</p>
