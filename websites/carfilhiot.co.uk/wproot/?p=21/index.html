<blockquote><p><strong>The Making of a Fugitive &#8211; Episode Two</strong><br />
Melancthe worked in the back office of a large commercial bank, in some clerical capacity. I shall refer to it as &#8220;The Bank of Lyonesse&#8221;. When she heard of my problems in getting another job, she suggested that it would be easy to get into The Lyonesse as a software engineer. &#8220;But,&#8221; I objected, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any references.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave that to me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Write me a true reference for yourself that describes your work and experience without mentioning your employer and I&#8217;ll see what I can do. I have contacts.&#8221; I did so.</p>
<p>A week later, Melancthe turned up with an application form for her bank, and gave me the name, address, email and telephone number of a referee &#8211; let us call him Shimrod &#8211; from another major bank. &#8220;Shimrod really exists. He&#8217;s a friend of mine.&#8221; Melancthe told me, &#8220;If you nominate him as one referee and they check with him, he will back up your experience. Nominate me as the second referee. It&#8217;s easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was easy. Within a month, I was a trusted member of The Lyonesse&#8217;s Wholesale Finance Division, Computing Department. I was deeply grateful to Melancthe, and showed it, so that when she phoned me up one evening I was honour bound to help her. &#8220;I&#8217;m stuck at work here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;And my password has stopped working &#8211; I think I screwed it up when I changed it this morning. Could you lend me yours so I can get this done? I need to fix this and I don&#8217;t want to call in my boss.&#8221; I am not a total idiot. I knew this was a rash thing to do, but why should I suspect Melancthe when she&#8217;d helped me so much?. I gave her the id and password &#8211; a password that was much more powerful than Melancthe&#8217;s own, giving access to the deepest recesses of the bank&#8217;s servers, and first thing next morning, I changed it. I did more than just change the password. I traced as much as I could of what she had done the previous night, and, you&#8217;ve guessed it, sitting in the centre of the bank&#8217;s trusted systems was a keystroke logger. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_logger" target=_blank>Definition for the morbidly curious here.</a></p>
<p>The article may give you a clue about the possible uses of key loggers.</p>
<p>I did not hesitate. I disabled the logger. Then I wondered who to tell. I wasn&#8217;t exactly in a strong position here, as the accomplice of the criminal, a criminal I had used as a referee, who had also arranged another false reference. What&#8217;s more, I was a convicted &#8220;hacker&#8221;. I was pretty sure that if I told the bank, they&#8217;d fire me and suppress the whole thing, and then I&#8217;d never get another job. So I told no-one. And I didn&#8217;t talk to Melancthe.</p>
<p>Of course, I knew Melancthe would know I&#8217;d killed her logger, and I really didn&#8217;t know how she&#8217;d react. I thought she herself was sufficiently vulnerable to be very cautious in pressing the matter. She&#8217;d had a go, I&#8217;d foiled her. End of story. Stalemate. And no more cosy Pacman sessions together, either.</p>
<p>She arrived at my flat at half past six, hysterical with fear and screaming that I had to help her. The criminal gang she was working for were making threats. She was as good as dead if the logger didn&#8217;t work. What did we care if the bank was robbed? Anyway, when it was over we&#8217;d both be so rich we could disappear and live a new life together. I couldn&#8217;t talk sense to her. She fell asleep still sobbing and begging and I made reassuring noises.</p>
<p>But that is not why I&#8217;m a fugitive. The robbery never took place.</p></blockquote>
