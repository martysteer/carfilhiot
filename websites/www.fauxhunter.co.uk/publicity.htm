<h2>Search Engines</h2>
This page is partly about search engines which is not relevant on the school 
project, but if it was the important thing is that Google is more important than
any other search engine. Yahoo is next, but miles behind, and all the rest are so
small you can ignore them. And never pay for Search Engine registration you
can do it all for free. You just have to find the right link on the Google
web page. Here are the rules you should use<UL>
<LI> Good domain name: before you decide on your domain name, look it up on Google because
sometimes a name is avalible for a domain name but its very common and you get
loads of hits on Google and you will never be the top hit. For example I can get
AlfredoGarcia.co.uk as a domain name but if you google it, its all that old movie comes up.
<LI>The first page of your web site must say the things that the website is
about because that's what google uses for its index
<LI>Its OK to tell Yahoo about your web site too. The method is a bit
different from google you have to know the category first but its easy
enough.
<LI>The more links there are to your web site on other peoples' web sites the 
higher marks you get on Google so even if you are on a search engine you
have to have other publicity.</UL> 
<h2>Other Publicity</h2>
Even with how good Search Engines are, people still have to find your name or
use the right keywords so its even more important to have links to your site
all over the place on other peoples sites so it helps with your points on
Google like I say. Most sites get twice as much visits from referall than
search engines so its very important.<UL>
<LI>The best plave is when you have your web site you put the url in your sig an
go to a lot of forums about the subject in this case scam busting and if your
ineteresting enough people visit your url.
<LI>Even if you are at another forum thats nothing to do with your subject of
your web site then its OK to have it in youre sig.
<LI>Get your friends to put a link in there web sites
<LI>If you can find web sites that have lists of scam buster sites or whatever
it is your subject they will be glad to put your url up as a link because
they need as many links as they can
<LI>Some of these we sites might want you to put up a link in yours to theres,
but always make the link open a new page with <code>&lt;a target=_blank</code> etc etc so
they dont lose you're page when they open the link. And dont make the linkbacks to easy to
find! I've got no external linx yet.
