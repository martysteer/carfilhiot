This web site is to warn about internet scams, and to report any scams I can find. In my
blog I tell how I got on. But first an introduction to some common scams.
<P><h2>419</h2>
The most famous scam is te 419 scam aka the Nigerian Scam. In this scam you get an email that tells 
you the sender has control of a huge amount of money and is going to give you ten percent of it if you 
help them to get the money into a bank account in your country. Very often the sender says they are 
in a country in West Africa like Nigeria but I have had them from senders that said they were in 
South Africa and Saudi Arabia.<P>
Sometimes they say the money belonged to a dead person, sometimes its oil revenue that has been 
put in a reserve account, or sale of a diamond mine, but its always millions of dollars and you are offered 
10 per cent - about a million - to just put the money in a bank account. If you agree and send an email
then there is lots of ways they finish up getting money off you. They make you belive the money is there
by giving you access code and password for a fake bank website where it looks as if the money is
there, then just before they send it to you they say they need advance fees you can send by money
order and just add it to your cut when you get the big transfer. Or if you use a bank account of your
own and send the details then they get your money.<P>
<a href = "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,172-1231403,00.html" target=_blank>Here is the story 
of a victim</a>
<P><h2>Lottery</h2>
This is nearly the same as 419. They email you that youve won a lottery somewhere in another country.
If you reply with your name and address, they send a fake cheque. Some of these cheques are so good 
fakes you bank will be fooled until its cleared. When the cheque arrives its for more money than you won.
They tell you that you got to send them money for clearance but they have increased the cheque to
cover the clearance charge so just send them a money order for the difference.
<P><h2>Phishing</h2>
Theres a lot of this around where they send an email with all these real looking logos from a bank or 
eBay or  Paypal or a credit card company saying to check your account for fraud and they give you
a web address to go to that looks just like the regular bank or eBay or Paypal log in screen and
you log in but actually what they do is to pick up your login details so they can use them
themselves, and buy stuff from eBay and get money from your bank or whatever.
<P>Here's a phishing email I got.<BR><img src="images/phishingebay.jpg">

<P><h2>Donate</h2>
This is where they wait for a disaster (they dont usually have to wait very long) and they set up a 
web site looking like a charity web site and they email everyone and ask you to donate and they
give you the web address. If you got to the web address that looks really right like OXFAM or
whatever and you give them your credit card info, it doesnt matter if you only gave
then a fiver, theyve got your details and they can buy lots of stuff with your credit card because 
there not a charity at all but they just look like one.
<P>Here's a screenshot of a fake charity website. It looks exactly the same as the real one.
