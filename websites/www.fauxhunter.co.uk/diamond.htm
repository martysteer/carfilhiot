I put my false name and a real (free) email address I got from fsnet.com into a guest
book it took longer than I expected but I finally got a 419 letter. I don know why they
always use capslock on these letters it really marks them out.

You must NEVER give them any real details. Mr Mackay was very worried about me
doing this but I showed him it was safe.

ATTN: EUGENE QUILL<P>

BEFORE I START, I MUST FIRST APOLOGISE FOR THIS UNSOLICITED MAIL TO YOU. I AM AWARE
 THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY AN UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO STARTING A RELATIONSHIP, BUT 
AS TIME GOES ON YOU WILL REALISE THE NEED FOR MY ACTION.<P>

MY NAME IS BARRISTER THOMAS ADEPOJU, A SOLICITOR AND THE PERSONAL ATTORNEY TO
MR MARTIN QUILL, A CITIZEN OF YOUR COUNTRY, WHO WORKED WITH A DIAMOND MINING
COMPANY HERE IN NIGERIA HEREIN AFTER REFERRED TO AS “MY CLIENT”. ON THE 21ST OF APRIL 2000, 
MY CLIENT, HIS WIFE AND THEIR THREE CHILDREN WERE INVOLVED IN A VITAL MOTOR ACCIDENT 
ALONG THE SHAGAMU EXPRESS ROAD. MY CLIENT AND HIS ENTIRE FAMILY UNFORTUNATELY LOST 
THEIR LIVES IN THE ACCIDENT.<P>

SINCE THEN I HAVE MADE SEVERAL ENQUIRIES TO YOUR EMBASSY TO LOCATE ANY OF MY CLIENT’S 
EXTENDED RELATIVES, WHICH HAS PROVED ABORTIVE AFTER THESE SEVERAL UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS.<P>

MY MAIN REASON FOR CONTACTING YOU IS TO ASSIST ME IN REPATRIATING THE MONEY AND PROPERTY 
LEFT BEHIND BY MY CLIENT BEFORE THEY ARE CONFISCATED OR DECLARED UNSERVICEABLE BY THE 
BANK WHERE THEY ARE DEPOSITED/LODGED IN LONDON, WHERE THE DECEASED HAS A FIXED SUM OF
 EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS. THE SAID BANK HAS ISSUED ME A FINAL NOTICE TO 
PROVIDE THE NEXT OF KIN OF MY CLIENT OR THEY WILL BE LEFT WITH NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO 
CONFISCATE HIS FUNDS. A COPY OF THE SAID NOTICE WHICH I WILL FAX TO YOU ON GETTING YOUR REPLY.<P>

SINCE I HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING MY CLIENT’S RELATIVES FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS NOW, 
I SEEK YOUR CONSENT TO PRESENT YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN OF MY CLIENT, GOING BY THE FACT THAT 
BOTH OF YOU HAVE THE SAME NATIONALITY, SO THAT THE SAID FUNDS AS STATED ABOVE, IE, THE SUM 
OF EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS, CAN BE PAID TO YOU INSTEAD OF LEAVING IT FOR THE 
BANK. WE CAN TAKE PART OF IT AND LEAVE THE REST TO CHARITY. I HAVE ALL THE NECESSARY LEGAL 
DOCUMENTS THAT CAN BE USED TO BACK UP ANY CLAIM WE MAY MAKE. ALL I REQUIRE IS YOUR 
HONEST CO-OPERATION TO ENABLE US TO SEE THIS ARRANGEMENT THROUGH. I GUARANTEE THAT 
THIS WILL BE EXECUTED UNDER A LEGITIMATE ARRANGEMENT THAT WILL PROTECT YOU FROM ANY 
BREACH OF THE LAW.<P>

PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR CONFIDENTIAL PHONE/FAX NUMBERS SO THAT I CAN FAX TO YOU ALL THE 
CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE BANK AND ME.<P>

Hi Thomas,<P>

I was interested to hear from you, but I am not sure you have found the right man. I had an uncle who worked in Africa
but he was not married and he was working on a cocoa farm. I have not heard from him for years, so its possible he
changed his job and got married. I would like to think that the money would not go to the bank or the goverment. Can you give me
any more details so we can be sure this is legal?<P>

Still the same day I got his reply it is very detailed and note he picks up the business I said about my uncle.<P>

Dear Eugene Quill,<P>

How are you today? I received your mail and the content was well understood. I want you to understand one thing,
 if the late Mr Martin Quill be your relative or not, but I want you to realise that this is a deal between both of us 
and needs to be top most secret.<P>

Firstly, I want to let you know that I have been the personal attorney to the late Mr Martin Quill for the past ten years, 
he has been in Nigeria for a long time but I am not sure what his work was before the diamond mine,
With regards to being attorney I stand to be the only authorised person who has the legal right to provide the next of kin of 
my late client, Mr Martin Quill, to the bank.<P>

As I earlier informed you in my proposal, the management of the bank in London have given me a mandate to produce 
the next of kin of my late client before a period of time. I will send to you the copy of the mandate notice. That is the
reason I am worried over the conclusion of this transaction. This transaction will not last more than fourteen working 
days from the moment you respond to this mail and also abide by my instructions.<P>

Once again, I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free on both sides and I have agreed to give you 40% 
out of the total sum for assisting me, and also I would furnish you with all the legal documents to back you up to 
claim this fund. Moreover, since you share your last name with my late client, we should not have any difficulty 
in claiming the fund because the bank only needs the documents that prove that you are the legitimate next of 
kin/beneficiary to the fund, which I promise to furnish you with as long as you stay true to this business.<P>

I would like you to furnish me with the following: <P>

Full name and address: to enable me process the necessary documents from the Ministry of Justice. <BR>
Personal phone and fax numbers: for easy communication.<P>
These are the informations I would want you to furnish me with. Not withstanding, I would also want you to
 open an account where these funds will be transferred to, or if you have an account that will contain the funds, 
which I believe will be preferable. Note that the moment I get your reply to this mail, I will send you the deposit 
certificate of the $18 million, which Union Bank of Nigeria PLC gave to my late client on the day of deposit, which 
he gave to me for safekeeping before his death. The money was deposited in Nigeria before the transfer to their 
branch in London upon the request of the depositor, as the late Mr Martin Quill wanted to use the money for 
investment in London before the auto crash accident which took his life away.<P>

As long as you stay truthful to this transaction, I assure you that it will be beneficial to both of us by the 
grace of god almighty. Please call me on this number immediately so that we can talk more: 234-1-7919130.<P>

Thanks and God bless,<P>

Dear Eugene Quill,<P>

I am very pleased to meet the famous Mr. Eugene Quill. I think my mother has one of your gramophone records.
I am glad you understand me on the deal. Perhaps you can give me the telephone and room number of your
hotel so I can talk to you directly. I am most careful that we do not discuss this with anyone
else, even Mr Hall.<P>
I will send to you today the deposit certificate the Union Bank of Nigeria PLC 
gave to my late client, Mr Martin Quill, on the day of deposit, which he kept with me before his death, 
and also the sworn affidavit form that I got from the court yesterday on your behalf for you to fill and send
 back to me immediately, to enable me to secure the sworn affidavit of claim that we need to back you to 
claim the fund in the bank. These documents will prove you the original next of kin to late Mr Martin Quill
 and also the real beneficiary of the aforesaid amount in the bank.<P>

Meanwhile I will send your bank particulars to the bank this morning for them to start processing your 
account, because the Union Bank of Nigeria, where the money was deposited before being transferred
 to London, will give the London bank approval to pay into your account as soon as they are okay with 
our claim.<P>

Thanks and God bless,<P>

Hi Thomas,<P>

I am sorry to be so long in coming back to you. I am writing to you from a
hotel internet access point in Wales, and I have a problem. Someone has stolen my wallet from the 
hotel room. I bet that kind of thing never happens in Nigeria. I always think of Nigeria as
small country villages where everybody looks out for everybody else and if you are a 
stranger, they take you in.<P>
But here in Wales they are not so nice. I cannot leave the hotel because I have no money
or credit cards to pay the bill and my pay for the concert was paid direct to my London bank. I only 
have a few Welsh Shillings left and it is not enough to get home where I can go to my
bank and get myself sorted out. Is there any way you can help? I tried Albert Hall, but he
is fully booked right now.<P>
I have telephoned my bank but they did not believe it was me because of course I do not have my
account number and I cannot answer there security questions. It may be weeks before I can
sort this out. Can you help please. I think we have become good friends.<P>

By the way I filled in the form and enclose it.<P>

Dear Friend,<P>

I was so worried about you my dear friend and we have lost a lot of time. I called your
friend Albert Hall twice and a woman replied who seemed to be his secretary but she
could not take the message. She gave me the telephone for Wigmore, but his
secretary just laughed and put the telephone down and I did not know what
else to do for contact.<P>
Yes, we have lost much time but I am sure we can still do the job if I go to the court this
afternoon. Then the Bank will contact you for certain.<P>
Your problem. Perhaps I can help tomorrow. What would you ask me to do?<P>

Hi Thomas,<P>

Thank you for offering to help. What I need is a small amount of money to be sent to
a friend of mine in London, and he will organise everything for me. But he only deals
in cash, so you would have to send say US$50 to him in an envelope. I know it will
take a while, but I can't move from here until this is fixed.<P>

Anyway we will both be rich by the end of the week Thomas, and I'll pay you back
DOUBLE when I am back in touch with my bank.<P>

Well lets see if he falls for this one. But before Thomas replies, the Bank of Nigeria 
replies with a very impressive letter. Strangely, the Bank seems to use the exact
same tinpot ISP in Lagos that Thomas uses!

HOW ARE YOU TODAY? I HOPE ALL IS WELL WITH YOU. I RECEIVED YOUR MAIL AND THE
 CONTENT WAS WELL UNDERSTOOD. REGARDS TO THE DOCUMENTS, I WENT TO COURT 
THIS MORNING TO KNOW HOW I CAN SECURE THE REMAINING DOCUMENTS, AS I HAVE 
ONLY THE CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT WHICH I SENT TO YOU, AND THE SWORN AFFIDAVIT 
OF CLAIM THAT I SENT TO YOU. ALSO, WHEN I REACHED COURT THIS MORNING I WAS TOLD 
THAT I WILL HAVE TO GO TO ABUJA, THE CAPITAL TERRITORY, TO SECURE THE TWO OTHER 
DOCUMENTS. IT IS ONLY THE DEATH CERTIFICATE THAT I WILL GET HERE IN LAGOS, BECAUSE 
HIS REMAINS WERE DEPOSITED IN THE HOSPITAL HERE IN LAGOS.<P>

MY BROTHER, TO GET THESE REMAINING DOCUMENTS WITH MY TICKECT FEE TO ABUJA 
WILL COST ME $9,800, AND THE MONEY LEFT WITH ME AFTER I SECURED THE SWORN 
AFFIDAVIT CLAIM ON YOUR BEHALF WAS $4,600, AND THE BANK GAVE ME A MANDATE 
TO MEET UP WITH.<P>

DEAR BROTHER, IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO BOTHER YOU FINANCIALLY, BUT AS I HAVE 
EXHAUSTED MY BORROWING POWER, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAVE SPENT CLOSE TO 
$38,000 BEFORE CONTACTING YOU ON THIS TRANSACTION? PLEASE, EVEN IF IT TAKES
 BORROWING FROM SOMEBODY WITH INTEREST, WE WILL PAY THE PERSON BACK AS SOON 
AS THIS MONEY CLEARS IN YOUR ACCOUNT NEXT WEEK, AS I WAS TOLD BY THE BANK THAT 
AS SOON AS WE SUBMIT THESE DOCUMENTS TO THE BANK, THIS MONEY WILL BE 
TRANSFERRED TO YOUR ACCOUNT WITHIN 48 WORKING HOURS.<P>

ALL THE SAME NOTHING GOOD COMES EASY. I WANT YOU TO ASSIST ME WITH THE 
REMAINING $5,200, WHICH IS ALMOST £3,500. BY THE NAME OF OUR LORD WHOM I SERVE, 
HE WILL NEVER LET US DOWN, SO I CAN GO TO ABUJA TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY TO 
SECURE THESE REMAINING DOCUMENTS, WHICH ARE THE APPROVAL FROM THE MINISTRY
 OF JUSTICE, A LEGALISATION LETTER FROM THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE AND THE DEATH 
CERTIFICATE OF THE LATE MR MARTIN QUILL.<P>

PLEASE DON’T BE OFFENDED WITH MY APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE. THIS IS DUE TO THE CONDITION 
OF THIS WITH ME. I DON’T SAY THAT YOU MUST GET THE WHOLE MONEY, EVEN IF YOU DON’T 
HAVE IT ALL, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH BECAUSE I AM STILL RUNNING 
ROUND TO RAISE SOME MONEY. BUT IF YOU CAN GET IT ALL, IT WILL BE APPRECIATED. PLEASE,
 I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS MONEY IS FOR BOTH OF US.<P>
