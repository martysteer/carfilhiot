	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>Just got back yestreday from Carfilhiots island. It was fantsatic. The weather was great and C is a cool guy. And so is Sofia, who arrived unexpected at the new year party. She and C know each other from Easter time because she was there on a student trip &#8211; you can read about it on Carfilhiots blog only shes called Suldrun there. Since then she was in a band as a bass player &#8211; really cool for a chick! I cant imagine why she stopped the band thing. Anyway.</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.fauxhunter.co.uk/images/gingerstank.jpg" width="475" height="343" border="0" alt="gingers tank" class="alignright"><br />
But there was something strange on Carfilhiots web site &#8211; a picture and some code wich I couldnt figure out but it seems to be put there by that frien called Ginger that he talks about. Heres the picture &#8211; NOT the original one which is still in place &#8211; its meant to be fuzzy because Carfilhiot says we dont know what the code means and dont want to look as if its us.<br />
I read a lot off the internet about codes while I was there but I couldnt decode it.</p>
<h3>what i found out</h3>
<ol>
<li>The tank picture has been scanned but the code and the arab writing was photoshoped on the computer</li>
<li>The arab writing says &#8216;god is good&#8217;</li>
<li>The code is not a &#8216;substitution&#8217; code like we did at school where you just put E for A, F for B and etc. </li>
<li>It looks like evry time you code a letter you change the code by some system</li>
<li>The date on the image file is not long before ginger went.</li>
<li>The log files on ACCESS is much more intresting. The first access is long before the date of the file, so thres been a earlyer verson of the file.</li>
<li>Theres sort of bursts of access and the last is just after the date of this one.</li>
<li>The accesss are from all over. UK USA Canada but mostly Pakistan. The couple of Greek ones are all the same and thats Gingers IP checking the file.</li>
</ol>
<h3>what Im doing</h3>
<ol>
<li>I will keep at the code but its not likely if I get it, and off course its probly in Arab so I could decode it and it still look rubbish.</li>
<li>Ive got a little java program working that checks all the time and lets me know is theres any access to the image at Carfilhiots site.</li>
<li>Especially Im waiting for a new one image to be put up, but nothing yet.</li>
<li>at the moment i am going thru every access and try to identify the IP but nearly all are public access ISP&#8217;s and I cant identify the othrs.</li>
</ol>

		<p>I cant beleive it becausr Carfilhiot has invited me to visit his island in Greece over the holidays. At first my Mum is sure this is an internet pedofile. I havent told her hes really just a bank robber heh heh! Anyway the guy shes going out with these days Kevin talked her into it. He goes whose going to believe a pedofile would go after Alfredo hes so unatractive (!) and also like because he wants Mum to himself over the holidays and he says he will buy the ticket for my Chrismas. Which is the best thing any of Mums boyfreinds has done ever and I wasnt even expecting anything from him. Even if he is married already which he is but hes left her.
<p>
Anyway Mum says I cant go till afetr Christmas itself so its the 28th.</p>

		<p>I spent a lot of time doing nothing but games and stuff instead of scam-baiting. because now I know where Carfilhiot is really I havent got a good project on. Even though I chased up a couple Barclays fake phishers &#8211; and reported them but nothing  ever happens to these guys.</p>

		<p>Carfilhiot has just confirmed to me his location in the Ionian Ilands and even put it in his website. Actully, he gave me a more acurate address but hes not putting on his site so the quest is over I suppose.</p>

		<p>Silly mistake on me because the Samos and Turkey quake didnt hapen till Friday and it was also a very big one (strength 6) so it would of felt pretty dangerous. Mind he could still be lying except hes so casual about it and hes not worried about being found anymore.</p>

		<p>GOTCHA! <a href="http://www.carfilhiot.co.uk/index.php?itemid=106" target=_blank>Carfilhiot</a> made the mistake Ive been waiting for.<br />
He talks about an earthquake on monday/tuesday last week thats 17-18 Oct. Now I find out where the quake really is and its Zakynthos but there it would be to strong for what C. feels so he has to be in the Ionian Islands thats where it was much weaker a quake. Still give me a bit of a range.<br />
Too there was one in Samos but I think thats to close to Turkey. But he dint blog it on the day it happens so its still a possible that I never thought of before. Back to the ferry time tables and wheather reports &#8211; lucky I kept them all.</p>

		<p>Carfilhiot isnt droping many hints theses days, so Ive been looking at a new type of virus I have been seeing where the From: is admin or webmaster or mail @ some domain &#8211; in my case fauxhunter.co.uk &#8211; and to some user in the same domain saying stuff like YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT WILL EXPIRE and with a whacking big attachment &#8211; like 45Kb.<br />
Their easy to reconize because of the size. You know I spent like sevral hours back tracking one of these thro <B>btinternet</b> back to some poor sods zombie computer on broadband that was whacking these messages out every few secs 24 7. (zombie means its been taken over by a hostile program that instals itself as a service and the owner knows nothing about it.)<br />
Anyway I found the actual IP of the guy, but I dont know who he is. I emailed btinternet about him but I dont suppose they will do anything because hes not the only one as I discoverd.</p>
